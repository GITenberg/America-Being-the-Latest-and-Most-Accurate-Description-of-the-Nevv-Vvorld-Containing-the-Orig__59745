The Sea, that takes several Denominations from the
Countreys which it washeth, and surrounding the dry
Land, cuts out, and shapes so many winding Bays,
Creeks, and Meandring Inlets, seems no where so
much confin’d and penn’d into so narrow a Channel,
as the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>: From whence again,
soon expatiating, it spreads it self into two immense,
and almost boundless Oceans, that which opens to the
North, gives terminaries to the four Regions of the
Earth; that to the South, onely to <i>Asia</i> and <i>America</i>; both which, indeed, are
but one continu’d Sea, extending it self round the Universal Globe.</p>

<p class='c010'>This watry part of the World, that almost through all Ages lay Fallow, hath
in these later times been Furrow’d by several Expert and Stout Captains, who
now by their Art and Industry, have given a good Account of, and made clear
Discoveries from East to West, where-ever the Sun rises or sets.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Northern Bounds under the <i>Artick-Zone</i>, have been hitherto so obstructed
with Ice, that the undertakings of such as adventur’d either to find
by the North-East or North-West a Passage to <i>India</i>, have been utterly
frustrate. Of the Southern, no such pains hath as yet been taken in the Discovery,
so that for the most part it is yet unknown how far the Water, either
deep or shallow, overspreads the Earth, onely thus much Experience hath made
out, that the <i>Antartick</i> needs lesser Line to Fathom, than the <i>Artick-Ocean</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Ancients had little knowledge in Navigation.</div>

<p class='c010'>The antient <i>Greeks</i>, <i>Phenicians</i>, and <i>Romans</i>, or whosoever that were Renown’d
by Antiquity, and Listed in the number of their famous Navigators, were no
less Timerous than Ignorant concerning Maritim Affairs, and are not fit to
stand in the least degree of competition with our later Voyagers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Navigation is very ancient.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Of old, by an inviolable Law, made by Custom, according to <i>Pliny</i>, <i>Vigetius</i>
and others, the Sea was lock’d up, from the eleventh of <i>October</i>, to the tenth of
<i>March</i>, no Ships daring to venture forth, dreading short Nights, and foul Weather;
neither in Summer, did they so much as once offer, unless driven by
Storms, to attempt the <i>Offin</i>, or loose sight of Land; yet there is no question,
but that several Nations in former Ages, made it their business, spending their
whole time, and wearying themselves in the Practical Art of Navigation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Sacred Scripture testifies, That the Kings of <i>Judea</i>, <i>Solomon</i>, <i>Jehosaphat</i>,
<i>Ozias</i>, and others, prepar’d several Fleets that Sail’d through remote Seas,
freighting themselves with Gold from <i>Ophir</i>, and other Rarities, which were
Imported to supply and enrich the <i>Holy-Land</i>. And <i>Strabo</i> also tells us, That
King <i>Solomon</i> being contemporary with <i>Homer</i>, then discover’d <i>India</i>. And <i>Pliny</i>
relates, That the <i>Romans</i>, in the Reign of <i>Augustus</i>, passing the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Gibraltar</i>,
and sleighting the <i>Ne plus ultra</i>, Coasted <i>Spain</i>, <i>France</i>, and <i>Belgium</i>, leaving not at
the Promontory of the <i>Cimbrians</i> (now call’d <i>Shager-Riff</i>) but also ventur’d into
the Northern Ocean, which washes <i>Norwey</i> and <i>Lapland</i>: But long before
this, as <i>Athenæus</i> relates, <i>Phileas Taurominites</i>, a <i>Grecian</i> Captain, and several
others pass’d the <i>Herculean-Pillars</i>, penetrating the Northern Seas as far as <i>Britain</i>,
and adventuring, made the first Discovery of <i>Thule</i>: And to the Southward
the <i>African</i> Coasts without <i>Gibraltar</i>, and beyond <i>Atlas</i>, were now and
then explor’d by several expert Captains. But more remarkable is the Voyage
of <i>Hanno</i> a <i>Carthaginian</i>, who out-sail’d these, and inspected the Coasts of
<i>Africa</i>, as far as the <i>Gorgades</i>: And <i>Eudoxus Cyzicenus</i>, flying from King <i>Lathyrus</i>,
set Sail from the <i>Arabian</i> Gulph, and passing the <i>Great-Cape</i>, came to an Anchor
at last in the Mouth of <i>Gibraltar</i>, having discover’d all the Eastern, Southern,
and Western parts of <i>Africa</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Voyage of some <i>Indians</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Of <i>Menelaus</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, it deserves special observation, That an antient <i>Swedish</i> King, as
<i>Cornelius Nepos</i> relates, sent as a Rarity and great Present to the <i>Roman</i> Consul
<i>Metellus Celer</i>, some <i>Indians</i>, who loosing their course, hatter’d up and down
with perpetual Storms and stress of Weather, were at last driven into the Northern
Ocean, where they suffer’d Shipwrack; yet saving themselves, Landed
on his Coast: <i>Aristonicus Gramaticus</i> relates, That <i>Menelaus</i> Sailing from the <i>Sack</i>
of <i>Troy</i>, became so great a Voyager, that leaving the <i>Straights</i>, he surrounded
<i>Africa</i>, and discovering <i>India</i>, after eight years re-measuring the same way he
went, return’d with great Riches in safety to his own Kingdom: Which is
consentaneous to <i>Homer</i>, who saith, <i>Odyss.</i> l. 4.</p>

<p class='c010'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. The Commentators on <i>Homer</i> have been very inquisitive to find out <i>Menelaus</i> Voyage into <i>Æthiopia</i>. <i>Crates</i> suppos’d that he pass’d out at the <i>Straights</i>,
doubled the Southern <i>Cape</i>, and so arriv’d thither. <i>Eratosthenes</i> conjectures, that in the time of <i>Homer</i> the <i>Straights</i> Mouth was an Isthmus, and the <i>Ægyptian</i>
Isthmus overflow’d by the Sea, which afforded him a shorter passage. But that is most probable which <i>Strabo</i> delivers, that he then went to the borders of <i>Æthiopia</i>,
when he pass’d up <i>Ægypt</i> to the City of <i>Thebes</i>; the Borders of <i>Æthiopia</i> being not far distant from thence in <i>Strabo</i>’s time, probably very near it in <i>Homer</i>’s.</p>

<i>Euergetes</i>, that he was a Native <i>Indian</i>, driven from their course into the place
where they found him by stress of Weather, and that his company were famish’d,
all their Provision spent in their Wandrings from their intended Voyage; Thus
being kindly entertain’d, he also promis’d the King to open his Passage (if so he
pleas’d) into <i>India</i>. The King slept not upon this Intelligence, but immediately
prepar’d a Fleet Freighted with such Commodities as were advis’d; with which
setting forth by the Conduct of this their <i>Indian</i> Pilot, they Anchor’d in their
desir’d Port, and brought the King in return from thence a rich <i>Cargo</i> of Silk,
Spices, costly Drugs, and precious Gems. <i>Cleopatra</i>, about sixty years after,
intending not to lose the advantages reap’d by the former discoveries, equipp’d
another and greater Navy; which passing through the Red-Sea, found the
Stern of a Ship, on which was Presented a Horse, whereby some of the more
knowing Sea-men judg’d, that it had been a <i>Gibraltar</i> Vessel, and Sailing about
<i>Africa</i>, there by sad accident suffer’d a Wrack. This Stern was afterwards set up,
and fix’d as a Memorial in the Market-place of <i>Memphis</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Venetians</i> were the first that drove a trade from <i>Europe</i> to the <i>East-Indies</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>How they went their journeys.</div>

<p class='c010'>In these later times, the first that endeavor’d to drive an <i>European</i> Trade
in <i>Africk</i>, and held Commerce with <i>India</i>, was the State of <i>Venice</i>, who
Sail’d from thence through the <i>Adriatick</i>, into the <i>Mediterranean-Sea</i>: So
Steering for <i>Alexandria</i>, where unlading their Goods, from thence they carry’d
them over Land, and Shipping again in the <i>Arabian</i> Gulph, Sail’d directly
for <i>India</i>. Thus by Land and Water, were exchang’d several Commodities,
and the <i>Indian</i> Growth and rich Products of the Oriental World plentifully
Transported to <i>Venice</i>, and from thence, all <i>Europe</i> had ample Accommodation,
until an <i>Egyptian Sultan</i> suffer’d the Way to be infested by Thieves
and Murdering Robbers, that so they were enforc’d to remove thence,
and Discharge their several Cargoes at <i>Aleppo</i>; from whence, on Mules and
Camels, they carry’d their Goods to <i>Babylon</i>, so to <i>Balsarum</i>, and then to
<i>Ormus</i>, where they Re-ship’d thence, directly standing for <i>India</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus they enjoy’d the benefit of so great a Trade and Commerce, until the
<i>Portuguese</i> found a Passage by Sea, saving the Expence and trouble of carrying
Goods so far by Land to <i>India</i>; Of which here we will a little inlarge.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>By what means the <i>Portuguese</i> came first to discover the Coasts of <i>Africa</i> and <i>India</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Why <i>Africa</i> was no further discover’d.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>John</i>, the first King of <i>Portugal</i>, who took from the <i>Moors</i>, by force of
Arms, <i>Septa</i>, an <i>African</i> City, having five Sons; <i>Henry</i> his fourth behav’d himself
so gallantly in the Leaguer of <i>Septa</i>, that after he became Master of the place,
this Prince made many bold Excursions in several Parties against the Enemy,
bringing in daily great store of Booty; so growing rich, he Rigg’d out
two new Vessels to make farther Discoveries along the Coast of <i>Africa</i>. Yet
this his Expedition went on but slowly, being much taken off in Building
there a new City, then call’d <i>Tarzanabala</i>, and since <i>Villa Infantis</i>; but being
Admonish’d by a Dream, and Check’d for his laying thus aside his first Design
of Navigation; he soon after, <i>Anno 1410.</i> set forth the Ships that he intended,
which he the more accelerated, being inform’d by some of his Prisoners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Natives, that <i>Africa</i> spread from the Basis of <i>Mount-Atlas</i>, very far towards
the South: This Mountain then was the Terminary of Navigation that way,
because thereabouts a long Ridge or Shelf of Sands thrust its Point under
Shallow Waters so far out into the Ocean, that none durst venture to Sail into
the <i>Offin</i>, being out of sight of Land to double this conceal’d <i>Cape</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Who first ventur’d into the <i>Offin</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Madera</i>’s, by whom peopled.</div>

<p class='c010'>The first that attempted to find Deep Water, and get round about, discovering
several unknown Coasts, and Uninhabited Isles belonging to that
Region, were <i>Joannes Gonsalves</i>, <i>Tristan Varseus</i>, and <i>Ægidius Annius</i>; amongst
which were the <i>Madera</i>’s, and <i>St. George de Picho</i>, which Prince <i>Henry</i> first
Planted with <i>Portuguese</i>, and others since with <i>Netherlanders</i>. He also obtain’d
a Grant from Pope <i>Martin</i> the Fifth, of all the discover’d Territories East-ward
from the <i>Canaries</i>, for ever to be the undoubted Right, and belonging to the
Crown of <i>Portugal</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>By whom <i>Genny</i> was discover’d.</div>

<p class='c010'>After <i>Henry</i>’s Decease, <i>Anno 1460.</i> the business of Navigation and Discoveries
of new Countreys, lay neglected, because King <i>Alphonso</i> turmoyl’d in a
Civil War, his Crown being at stake, had not leisure to think or look after
uncertain improvements by Sea; yet at last having quell’d his Enemies, he
ventur’d forth some Ships, who Sail’d as far as the River <i>Zenaga</i>, and came to
Anchor before the City of <i>Genny</i>, famous since for Trade, which gave its denomination
to the Countrey and Coasts of <i>Guiny</i>, where they dealing, Barter’d
for Ivory, Gold, Slaves, and also got so much footing into the Countrey, that
they suddenly rais’d up a Fort, and Man’d it with a strong Garrison, Shipping
their Slaves for <i>Lisbon</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>John</i> the Second succeeding his Father <i>Alphonso</i>, had a great design upon <i>Arabia</i>
and <i>India</i>, and if possible, was ambitious to open a Passage from the <i>Atlantick</i>,
to the <i>Oriental-Seas</i>. But the difficulty lay in Steering so often from sight
of Land, venturing into the Main Ocean, obstructed by so many dangerous
Shoals that lay so far out into the <i>Offin</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>For the Northern Constellations the <i>Astrolabe</i> was in use long before.</div>

<p class='c010'>At that time flourish’d three famous Mathematicians, <i>Rhoderick</i>, <i>Joseph</i>, and <i>Martin
Bohemus</i>, Pupils bred up by <i>Joannes Monteregius</i>; with which the King
consulting, perswaded, that they would by their Art invent some Instrument,
that by Southern Constellations, the Pole being depress’d, the Navigator might
know where he was, and in what height; so guessing what distance they were
from this or that Countrey; they accordingly Club’d Learning, and by their
great Study, found out what since hath prov’d so useful and beneficial to Seamen,
the <i>Astrolabe</i>; which help having obtain’d, the Sailers encourag’d, more
frequently ventur’d into remote and unknown Seas.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>John</i> the Second, seeks to discover <i>India</i> by water.</div>

<p class='c010'>After these, King <i>John</i> of <i>Portugal</i> sent <i>Jaques Cano</i> with a Fleet, who Sailing,
found the River <i>Zaires</i>, where he erected a Pillar with an Inscription, <i>Latin</i>
and <i>Portuguese</i>, signifying by whom, and in what Kings Reign these <i>African</i> Coasts
were discover’d: Here he also met some of the Natives, who more civiliz’d
than the rest, told him, That they had a mighty King, who Raigning over
them, kept his Court some few days Journey up in the Countrey, to whom
<i>Cano</i> sending his Agents, detain’d four <i>Africans</i> as Pledges, which he carry’d
with their free consent to <i>Portugal</i>, promising to bring them back in fifteen
Months, who before that time having got some smatterings of their Tongue,
inform’d them, that their Native Soyl was call’d <i>Congo</i>, whither returning by
the appointed time, they were according to their agreement, exchang’d for the
<i>Portuguese</i>, and <i>Cano</i> address’d himself with rich Presents to their King, whom he
found sitting in their manner on an Ivory Throne, being from the middle upward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Naked, his nether parts cover’d with long Silken Skirts, a Golden Armlet
on his left Arm, athwart his Shoulders hung a Horses Tail, their Badge of
Royal Dignity: <i>Cano</i> humbly laid the Presents down at the Kings feet, amongst
which was a Gilded Flag, or Pennon with a Cross, which Pope <i>Innocent</i> the
Eighth had Consecrated with great Ceremony. After this, many of that Nation
became Christians, and the King himself receiv’d Baptism. But in short
time, by the Instigations of their Diabolical Priests, and others, Christianity
loosing ground, grew out of countenance: Mean while, King <i>John</i> the
Second vigorously Prosecuted the business of Discovery, sending <i>Jews</i> and <i>Christians</i>
by Land from <i>Alexandria</i> and other parts of <i>Egypt</i> to <i>India</i>, and from thence
to explore the Coasts on the Eastern side of <i>Africa</i>, to the <i>Great-Cape</i>; if so a way
might be found fit for Navigators, having doubled that Point, to Traffick with
the Oriental parts of the World.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Vasques de Gama</i>, his expedition.</div>

<p class='c010'>After this Princes Death the Work lay sill a while, but in short time, King
<i>Emanuel</i> his Successor freshly undertook the business once more, sending <i>Vasques
de Gama</i> with four Ships, who passing through many Dangers with great Difficulties,
Anchor’d at last before <i>Calecut</i>, and was the first of the <i>Europeans</i> that found
a way to the <i>East-Indies</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Christopher Columbus</i>’s.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Dividing of the earth.</div>

<p class='c010'>But <i>Christopher Columbus</i>, five Years before <i>Gama</i>’s Expedition to the East, had
been employ’d in Western Discoveries, which prov’d so very successful, that
he found no less than another World; which soon after, from <i>Americus Vesputius</i>,
was call’d <i>America</i>: So that the Division of the World by the Antients,
(concerning which they had so long err’d, and were utterly mistaken) was
now made manifest by Experience, and undisputable Demonstration; for
formerly the whole World was known by no other names than <i>Asia</i>, <i>Africa</i>,
and <i>Europe</i>, but now, those three are found to make but one Part of what incircles
the Universal Globe; because in the South lies a second, known no further
than by its Coastings and Superficial Margents; the third part being the
New-World, our <i>America</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A query, if <i>America</i> was known to the Ancients.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Atlantica. Plato in Crisis &amp; Timæo.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Here it will not seem amiss, having prov’d that <i>Africa</i> was more than
Coasted by the Ancients, to ingage and search with some scrutiny concerning
this <i>America</i>; First, Whether at any time ’twas known by the Ancients?
And next, by what People, and when first Inhabited? About the
former, the Learned of these later times Jangle amongst themselves, for
some of them will needs ascribe so much Honor to Antiquity, declining the
Worthy Praise of those that made so wonderful a Discovery, as if they of old,
and many Ages before, had done the same, or at least, that this New-World to
them was not unknown, maintaining this their bold Assertion from the Authority
of what they find, both in Ancient <i>Greek</i>, and <i>Latin</i> Authors: First,
especially in the Learned <i>Plato</i>, who, as you know at large, describes a New
<i>Atlantis</i>, lying beyond the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Gibraltar</i>; whose Coast is surrounded with
two vast Seas that are Sow’d thick with scatter’d Islands. By these Seas they
understand the Atlantick and Southern-Sea, by the many Isles, <i>Cuba</i>, <i>Hispaniola</i>,
<i>Jamaica</i>, <i>California</i>, and others, which lie sprinkled along the Coasts of <i>America</i>.
But it cannot be made out, that <i>Plato</i> describes ought but a Fancy, his own
<i>Idea</i>, not a Countrey that ever was, is, or shall be, though he sets it forth so Accurately,
and with such Judgment, as if he had taken a Survey of the place, and
found such a Land indeed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Diod. Sic.</i> lib. 6.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Arist. de Mirandis in Natura auditis.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>In like manner, <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> undertakes to prove, That <i>America</i> was known
to the Antients; telling a Story, how the <i>Phenicians</i> were driven by a Storm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>from the Coasts of <i>Africa</i> West-ward, falling at last upon a great and altogether
unknown Island, which our late Expositors take for <i>America</i>; Must it
therefore be so? Surely not, for it is onely a bare Story, without any Proof or
the least Testimony. They endeavor to make <i>Aristotle</i> bolster up their opinion
that he had a knowledge of this New-World, which with no small pains they
pump from these Words: “Beyond the <i>Herculean</i> Pillars, certain <i>Carthaginian</i>
Merchants penetrated the Atlantick Ocean so far, that at last they found a
vast, yet un-inhabited Island, producing nothing but Herbage, Plants, and
Wild-Beasts, yet interlac’d with many Meandring Rivers, abounding with
several sorts of Fish, lying some days Sail from the Continent; they Landing,
found a Soyl so fertile, and Air so temperate, that there they setled, and were
the first Planters of that Isle. But the <i>Carthaginians</i> having intelligence thereof,
Prohibited all Persons whatsoever, upon Pain of Death, to go thither, fearing
the place being so much commended, all the People would be ready
to flock thither, and desert their own, and so utterly unfurnish and debilitate
their then growing Common-wealth.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Æneid.</i> lib. 6.</div>

<p class='c010'>But how could the <i>Carthaginians</i> find <i>America</i>, without the use of the Compass?
How happen’d it, that they were so taken with the fertility of this their
New-found-Land, when the Adjacent Countreys and Fields about <i>Carthage</i> are
every where Flourishing, and most Luxurious? So that it may better be suppos’d,
that what <i>Aristotle</i> found so long since, may rather be the <i>Canary-Isles</i>, or
<i>Great-Brittain</i>, than <i>America</i>. The <i>Greeks</i> having then also made some Inspection
into the <i>Brittish-Isles</i>. They would also make you believe, that <i>Virgil</i> the Prince
of Latin Poets, had known the New-World in these Verses; <i>Æneid.</i> lib. 6.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>America</i> was not known to the Ancients.</div>

<p class='c010'>But what of all this? Who finds in any of these Writings, any Marks of
<i>America</i>, or the least Description thereof? Though we cannot deny that the
Antient Sages and Wise Philosophers of former times might easily make out,
and no question did, that the Earth and Sea made the perfect Figure of a Globe;
first from the round Shadow of the Earth that Ecclipses the Moon; the different
Risings and Settings of the Celestial Luminaries; and the still Variation
of the Pole; so that the Earth and Sea making one Ball, they might
easily conjecture, that the South-side of the Equinoctial might be Inhabited as
well as the North: But all this was more grounded upon Natural Reason and
Right Judgement, than any Experience of theirs, or the least certain knowledge
thereof, which since these later times had the first happiness to obtain;
so laying these Conjectures aside, there have been none more grosly erroneous,
and so utterly mistaken in this Point, than some of the Ancients, and especially
the Fathers of the Church.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lactant.</i> l. 3. c. 24.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Lactantius Firmianus</i>, and St. <i>Austin</i>, who strangely jear’d at as ridiculous,
and not thinking fit for a Serious Answer the Foolish Opinion of <i>Antipodes</i>, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>another Habitable World beyond the <i>Equator</i>: At which, <i>Lactantius</i> Drolling,
says, <i>What, Forsooth, here is a fine Opinion broach’d indeed; an</i> Antipodes!
<i>heigh-day! People whose Feet tread with ours, and walk Foot to Foot with us; their Heads
downwards, and yet drop not into the Sky! There, yes, very likely, the Trees loaden with
Fruit grow downwards, and it Rains, Hails, and Snows upwards; the Roofs and Spires of
Cities, tops of Mountains, point at the Sky beneath them, and the Rivers revers’d topsi-turvy,
ready to flow into the Air out of their Channels!</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lactant.</i> error concerning our <i>Antipodes</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>As also St. <i>Austin. de Civit. Dei</i> l. 16. c. 9.</div>

<p class='c010'>But these seeming witty Observations of <i>Lactantius</i>, though they may serve
for a Jest, yet are not grounded on any serious Reasons; for the Earth and Sea
being Globular, making one Universal Ball; all Materials whatsoever that
belong to this great Body, sink by a natural Propensity towards its Center;
so that where-ever we Travel, our Feet are downwards, and our Heads upwards,
the Sky above, and the Earth beneath; neither need they fear, that any
where the Earth should Moulder and drop into the Clouds: But St. <i>Austin</i>
Reasons better, admitting that the Earth and Sea make a Universal Globe;
yet it no way follows, that inhabited Countreys should lye opposite to our
Northern, nay, altogether impossible, seeing that side which is our <i>Antipodes</i>
is all nothing but Sea; and should we allow, that there were Land and Water
mixt as ours is, who could prove, that they were Peopled? or how could any
get thither, over such Vast and Immense Seas? or possibly pass the extream
heat of the Torrid Zone, not to be endur’d by any living Creature? And
what then becomes of Sacred Scripture, which says positively, <i>That all Men were
deriv’d from</i> Adam, <i>and after the Floud, from</i> Noah <i>and his three Sons</i>? Therefore
the Nations of the <i>Antipodes</i> must be of another Abstract, there being no possibility
(as they suppos’d) of passing from this World to that: But since the Discovery
of the <i>East</i> and <i>West-Indies</i>, Experience, the best Mistress, hath taught,
that in the South are mighty Lands and vast Territories, and that as far as they
have been Penetrated, are found to be full of People, extending their Dominions
from East to West. And though St. <i>Austin</i> deny’d this now well-known
Truth, yet long before his time, <i>Cicero</i>, <i>Pliny</i>, and others amongst the <i>Greeks</i>
and <i>Romans</i>, divided the Earth under five <i>Zones</i>; which <i>Virgil</i> describes
thus:</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Macrob. in Somnio Scipionis.</i> l. 2. c. 5.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Vide Carpent. Geograph.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>With <i>Virgil</i>, <i>Pliny</i>, and the Prince of Latin Orators agree, who saith,
“You see, that those that inhabit the Earth dwell in Countreys so separated
one from another, that it is impossible they should have any Commerce;
some of them are our <i>Antipodes</i>, walking with their Heads downwards, some
their Feet against our sides, others, as we, with their Heads upright. You see
how the same Earth seems to be Swath’d about with Rolls, of which, two
separated by the other three, are at utmost distance one from the other, lying
equi-distant under the Vertick Points of Heaven, always cover’d with
Snow and Ice; but the middlemost and greatest is scorch’d by the violent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>heats of the Sun: Two Tracts are Habitable, one to the South, our <i>Antipodes</i>,
the other North, which we Inhabit.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Pliny</i> lib. 2.</div>

<p class='c010'>And <i>Pliny</i> also affirms, though against the Vulgar Opinion, this truth,
“That the Earth is round about inhabited, and that people walk Foot to Foot
in most parts thereof; though every one be ready to ask why our <i>Antipodes</i> drop
not into the Sky; which question, our <i>Antipodes</i> may also ask concerning us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But although the Ancients upon these and the like Demonstrations well understood,
that there was a Habitable World towards the South under our <i>Horizon</i>,
yet they could not make out or believe, that there was any possibility to
pass thither; And, according as St. <i>Austin</i> conceiv’d, That the Earth produc’d
nothing under either Pole, by reason of excessive cold, and that the <i>Equinoxs</i>
or <i>Middle-Zone</i>, was not to be penetrated, because of the insufferable heat.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Macrob. in Somno Scip.</i> lib. 2.</div>

<p class='c010'>And <i>Macrobius</i> saith, “That the <i>Equinoctial</i> Circle, the <i>Artick</i> and <i>Antartick Lines</i>,
bind the two Habitable <i>Zones</i>, and make Temperate by the excessive Neighboring
Heats and Colds; and these Countreys onely give Animation, and
comfortable Enjoyment to all Living Creatures.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, St. <i>Austin</i> in some places seems to clear his own Doubts, saying,
“That People, if they could find a means to Sail those Vast and Undiscover’d
Seas, might make Land, raising new Stars under another Sky.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How beasts came on remote Islands.</div>

<p class='c010'>A Learned Father, searching after the Original of all sorts of Beasts which
multiply by Generation, concludes, That they must derive themselves from
those that were sav’d with <i>Noah</i> in the Ark. But how came they to the Isles?
To those adjacent and near the Main Land, they might easily Swim; to the remoter,
they were Transported.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>And chiefly the wild.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Austin</i> is contradicted.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>How men came to new Countreys.</div>

<p class='c010'>But this Doubt is not altogether clear’d, for the Domestick and other Creatures
fit for Humane use and Sustenance were thus brought thither: Yet how
comes it to pass, that Voracious and Wild Creatures are also found there, such
as Wolves, Tigers, Lions, and other Beasts of Prey? This puzzle putting St. <i>Austin</i>
to a stand, he had no other means to get off, but by saying, that by God’s
Commands or Permission, the Angels convey’d them thither; If so, why might
not God please to Plant Men there in like manner, and the rather, the Earth being
created for Humane use? But what needed this, when Men can in Ships
Transport themselves, either of their own accord for curious Inquest, to find
new Countreys, or else enforc’d by stress of Weather, to far remoter, and altogether
unknown Lands: Besides, though the Earth is here and there divided
by large Bays and vast Seas, yet nevertheless, in other places it is all continu’d
Land, or at least parted by some narrow In-let or Sea; so that there was no
difficulty for a crouded Plantation to go over, and so ease themselves in another
Countrey, till then not Inhabited; therefore none need to question, but
that from <i>Adam</i>, or nearer, from <i>Noah</i>’s three Sons, <i>Sem</i>, <i>Ham</i>, and <i>Japhet</i>, those,
as well as we, were extracted, that Inhabit this our other World.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Reasons why <i>America</i> was so long unknown.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Who first sail’d on the Ocean.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Several opinions of the Antients concerning it.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Brittains</i> amongst the first Inventors of Navigation.</div>

<p class='c010'>But one question is to be observ’d, How first after the expiration of so many
Ages in these our later times, a New-World was discover’d, altogether
unknown to the Antients, when they in the greatness of their Parts and Undertaking,
Prowess and Prudence, were no ways inferior to the Modern, and
every way as fit for great Designs and grand Exploits? We need not scruple or
make the least doubt, but the Sea hath been Navigated of old; but the first attempters
set forth unexperienc’d, in as pittiful and ill-contriv’d Vessels. The
<i>Heathens</i> ascribe the Art of Navigation, first to the <i>Cretans</i>, who under the Conduct
of <i>Neptune</i>, set forth a Navy to explore Foraign Countries. But <i>Pliny</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>long before gives the Invention of this Art to <i>Erythra</i>, King of <i>Egypt</i>, who upon
Pieces of Timber, conjoyn’d and brac’d together, crept along the Shores, and
ventur’d to Discover the Isles in the <i>Red-Sea</i>. But others give that honor to the
<i>Trojans</i>, and <i>Micians</i>, when with a Fleet by Sea, they Invaded <i>Thrace</i>: Others,
to the <i>Brittains</i>, who made little Vessels of Leather, and were the first that by
this Invention found how to Float upon the Waters: Some plead, that the
<i>Samothracians</i> were first; Others, that <i>Danæus</i> before all, found a way by Sea
from <i>Egypt</i> to <i>Greece</i>. But without all Contradiction, <i>Noah</i>’s Ark was the Pattern
or Sample, that succeeding Ages imitating, built their Ships by; and the
more probable, because his Offspring multiplying so fast, that they were enforc’d
to inlarge their Colonies, by passing Seas, and other broad Rivers, to
settle their Super-numeraries there.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The first Inventers of several things belonging to Shipping.</div>

<p class='c010'>So <i>Jason</i> Invented a Ship, which he call’d <i>Argos</i>, which <i>Sesostris</i> King of <i>Egypt</i>
took as his Pattern. Next, the <i>Biremis</i>, a Galley with double Banks of Oars,
was made by the <i>Erythreans</i>; with treble Banks, by the <i>Corinthian Amocles</i>; the
addition of the <i>Quadruple</i>, the <i>Carthaginians</i> boast; of the <i>Quinqueremis Nesichthon</i>,
<i>Alexander the Great</i>, brought them to twelve Banks; <i>Ptolomy Soter</i>, to fifteen;
<i>Demetrius</i>, <i>Antigonus</i> Son, doubled them to thirty; <i>Ptolomy Philadelphus</i>, to forty;
and last of all, <i>Philopater</i> rais’d them to fifty Banks of Oars. <i>Hippus</i> a <i>Tirian</i>,
was the first that set Ships upon the Stocks; the <i>Rhodians</i> a Ketch, and the
<i>Batavians</i> a Boat; the <i>Copes</i> made the first Oar; <i>Dedalus</i> the Mast and Boltsprit;
<i>Piscus</i> the Beak; the <i>Tyrrheans</i> the Anchor; <i>Tiphys</i> the Rudder; taking example
from the motion of a Kites Stern; <i>Icarus</i> found Sails, fancy’d by the Poets
for Wings, though some ascribe that honor to his Father <i>Dedalus</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Why in former Ages no remote Countreys were discover’d.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Minos</i> was the first that Ingag’d in a Sea-Fight, whereby we may easily conjecture,
that of old none adventur’d far into the <i>Offin</i>, or to remote Countreys,
not daring to trust their so sleight contriv’d Vessels. But these later times have
strangely and suddenly improv’d this growing Art of Navigation, yet pitch’d
not to that height at first, as boldly to adventure, and loose sight of Land.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The manner of the Antients Sailing.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Of the <i>Romans</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Why <i>America</i> was so lately known.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Tyrians</i> first understood how to Steer their Course by the North-Star,
and when dark and foul Weather had Clouded the Sky, that they could neither
see Heaven or Earth, but onely Sea, they directed their Course by the
Wind; and if they doubted the change thereof, they let some Birds flie, whom
they follow’d, supposing that they stood directly to the nearest Land. But
these are but poor helps, and blind Guides to shew you Land from the middle
of the boundless Ocean. It is certain, that the <i>Romans</i> in the time of <i>Julius Cæsar</i>
and <i>Augustus</i>, stretch’d the Bounds of that Empire Eastward to <i>Euphrates</i>, the
<i>Rhyne</i>, and the <i>Danube</i>, and Westward to the <i>Ocean</i> and <i>Mount Atlas</i>, Sailing up
and down the <i>Mediterranean</i>, with great Fleets, which stoutly endur’d the violence
both of Waves and Weather; but all this made them not so hardy, as
once to think or look after new Worlds. But after the <i>Roman</i> power decreas’d,
by several Eruptions of the <i>Goths</i>, <i>Vandals</i>, <i>Huns</i>, <i>Normans</i>, <i>Lumbards</i>, and other
Northern Countreys, which swarm’d with People, that overflow’d all places
like a Deluge, so that <i>Europe</i> was every where puzzel’d and Imbroyl’d, their
whole business consisting in conjoyning Forces to withstand such bold Invaders,
and so vexatious an Enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>And farther East, <i>Asia</i> was at the same time little better, still trembling
at the daily Alarms and Incursions of the <i>Scythians</i>, <i>Persians</i>, and <i>Saracens</i>; and
afterwards the <i>Turks</i> growing upon them more than any of the former, expected
no other than a sad Catastrophe, so that the known World had too much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>work cut out for them by these Distractions and Alterations of Government,
then to go in Quest of uncertainties, to find they know not where, another.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Hieron. in</i> c. 2. <i>Ephes.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Here also is added by St. <i>Jerom</i>, what an antient Writer saith, <i>Great care hath
been taken in Computing the Age of this World, and if there be another which Commenc’d
not with ours</i>, (as <i>Clemens</i> mentions in his Epistles) <i>where are scituate those Seas and
Lands that make that second World? Or is a part of that, in which</i> Adam <i>was Created?
Or may it not rather Metaphorically be taken for Worldly Affairs, govern’d by the Prince of
the Air, ruling in the Hearts of the Children of Disobedience?</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Antients opinion of an unknown world.</div>

<p class='c010'>But <i>Pliny</i>, <i>Cicero</i>, and <i>Virgil</i>, the best in their kind of Latin Writers, concur,
That there may be a habitable World under our <i>Horizon</i>, in the temperate
Southern <i>Zone</i>, beyond the extream heat, and on this side of the <i>Antartick</i>
colds.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>In Comment. super</i> Obad. v. 19, 20, 21.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>And they of the south shall possess the mount of</i> Elau, <i>and they of the plain, the</i> Philistines: <i>and they shall possess the fields of</i> Ephraim, <i>and the fields of</i> Samaria, <i>and</i> Benjamin <i>shall possess</i> Gilead. <i>And the captivity of this host of the children of</i> Israel <i>shall possess that of the</i> Canaanites, <i>even unto</i> Zarephath, <i>and the captivity of</i> Jerusalem, <i>which is in</i> Sepharad, <i>shall possess the Cities of the south. And saviors shall come upon mount</i> Zion, <i>to judge the mount of</i> Esau, <i>and the kingdom shall be the LORDS</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>But what signifies all this to the Discovery of <i>America</i>, which lies not onely
under the scorching Heats of the <i>Equinox</i>, but under the Frosts and Snows of
the <i>Artick</i> and <i>Antartick-Poles</i>? Yet less probable is that which <i>Lodowick Leo</i>, an
<i>Augustine</i> Frier takes out of <i>Obadiah</i>; as if that Prophet in the three last Verses of
his <i>Prophecy</i> should speak of the <i>Spaniards</i>, which should not onely discover and
Conquer <i>America</i>, but also Convert the Inhabitants to the <i>Christian Faith</i>, because
those that are in <i>Sepharad</i>, should Inherit and Possess the Cities of the South,
<i>And Saviours shall arise from the Mountains of</i> Zion, <i>to judge the Mount and Wealth
of</i> Esau.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If <i>America</i> is known in the Scripture.</div>

<p class='c010'>But certainly, <i>Obadiah</i> meant no other than the Restauration of the <i>Jews</i> from
the Captivity of <i>Babylon</i>, who after their return, should grow more powerful
than ever, and they, led by their <i>Messias</i>, obtain the height of all felicity, who
would send his <i>Evangelists</i> and <i>Apostles</i> to declare Salvation to the utmost Borders
of the Earth. It is true, that the <i>Rabins</i> Expound <i>Sepharad</i> to be <i>Spain</i>, and
therefore he concludes, that <i>Obadiah</i> Prophesi’d of the <i>Spaniard</i>, and their Conquests
in <i>America</i>; so they would prove, that <i>America</i> was long known before
Christ.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Solomon</i>’s Fleet sail’d not to <i>Peru</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>And lastly, It signifies as little what <i>Pineda</i> and <i>Levinus Lemnius</i> drive at,
That <i>Solomon</i> first finding the use of the Compass, Rigg’d a Navy at <i>Ezion-Geber</i>,
which from the <i>Red-Sea</i> had no indirect Course to the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>;
from whence he might Lade his Vessels with the Gold of <i>Peru</i>. In whose Description
it shall be manifested, that <i>Peru</i> is not <i>Ophir</i>, as some without any
shew of Reason or Truth would make us believe.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Solomon</i> did not find the Compass.</div>

<p class='c010'>But as concerning King <i>Solomon</i>’s finding out the use of the <i>Magnet</i>, it is
soon said, but not easily proved; for though that Prince exceeded all Man-kind
in Wisdom and Learning, and was perfect in the Operations, and knew the
Occultest Secrets of Nature, understanding what e’re belong’d to Plants, from
the Cedar of <i>Libanus</i>, to Hysop, and the meanest Shrub that grows upon the Wall;
yet it nothing makes out, that he knew the Mystery of the Navigable use of
the <i>Load-Stone</i>: But suppose he did know, there is no where any mention of it;
and if this excellent thing, the <i>Compass</i>, had been found in <i>Solomon</i>’s time, how
came it afterwards so utterly to be lost?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Load-stone, by whom found.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange operations of the Loadstone.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Variance of the Compass.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Genebrad. Chron.</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'>When, and by whom the Compass was found.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Albertus Magnus</i> mistakes, when he ascribes the knowledge of the <i>Compass</i> to
<i>Aristotle</i>, of which he himself makes not the least mention; neither <i>Galen</i>, <i>Alexander
Aphrodisiensis</i>, <i>Pliny</i>, <i>Lucretius</i>, nor any of the <i>Roman</i>, <i>Greek</i>, <i>Arabian</i>, or
other Countrey Writers whatsoever. Some give the honor thereof to an <i>Indian</i>,
others to a Shepherd in <i>Mount Ida</i>, whose Clouted Shooes being full
of Hob-Nails, the Iron sticking fast to the Stones on which he stood, stopt his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>motion. And although the Antients found out many Secrets of Nature,
amongst which this of the <i>Load-Stone</i>, Attracting Iron, as being its proper Food;
and the three sorts of the <i>Magnet</i>, of which some will not draw Steel, found by
<i>Theamedes</i> a <i>Greek</i> Author, and other since, well known Properties: Yet they
never attain’d that knowledge, that the <i>Load-Stone</i> would ease Pain, and stop
the effusion of Blood, though the edge piercing the Skin, open’d the Vein: as
<i>Hieronimus Cardanus</i> experienc’d on himself and others, which he had from <i>Laurentius
Guascus</i>, a great Chyrurgeon. Much less, that the Needle of the <i>Compass</i>
being touch’d by the <i>Load-Stone</i> on the Northside of the <i>Equinox</i>, respects the
North; but depressing the <i>Artick</i>, and raising the <i>Antartick</i> Pole, it looks as stedfastly
towards the South: But far less dreamt they of its several variations,
according to the Coasts that are nearest; as when you come from the Island <i>del
Cuervo</i>, the Point varies more West; but Sailing towards the <i>Equinox</i>, it varies
Eastward; by which we may absolutely conclude, that without this use of the
<i>Load-Stone</i>, first found by <i>Flavius Melvius</i> a <i>Neapolitan</i>, in the Year 1303. it was altogether
impossible to reach <i>America</i>. So that <i>Joseph de Acosta</i> mistakes, who
gives the honor of the finding so great a benefit to Navigation, to some <i>Mahumetan</i>
Sea-men which <i>Vasques de Gama</i> met with near <i>Mosambique</i>, who had Sail’d
those Seas by the use thereof; whereas <i>Gama</i>’s Expedition was above a hundred
years after <i>Melfius</i>, who liv’d in such a juncture of time for Mathematical
Learning, that few Ages boasted the like: For then flourish’d in <i>England</i>,
and were Contemporaries, besides others abroad, <i>Richard Wallingford</i>, <i>Nicolas de
Lynna</i>, <i>John Halifax</i>, <i>Walter Britte</i>, <i>John Duns</i>, and <i>John de Lignarys</i>, all eminent
in Astronomical Arts, belonging to Navigation, and doubtless, no small helps
to <i>Melfius</i> in this his happy Invention.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, We will relate what hath been held as a seeming Testimony, (that
<i>America</i> was known to the <i>Europeans</i> before the Birth of our Saviour) by an antique
Meddal of the Emperor <i>Augustus</i>, digg’d out of the Ground in <i>Peru</i>, and
sent to his Holiness at <i>Rome</i>, which may well be reckon’d with the like
Cheat contriv’d by <i>Hermicus Cajadus</i>, <i>Anno 1505.</i> near <i>Syntra</i>, a Town in <i>Portugal</i>,
where three Marbles Ingraven with antient Characters, concerning a Prophecy
of discovering the <i>East-Indies</i> by the <i>Portuguese</i>, in the Reign of King <i>Emanuel</i>,
were privately bury’d under Ground, and not long after, by a pretended
accident digg’d out, which made such a bustle amongst the Learned, that several
tired themselves about the explanation of the suppos’d Sibylline Prediction.</p>

<h3 id='c11' class='c001'>CHAP. II.<br /> <i>Of the Original of the</i> Americans, <i>whence they came, when, how, and from what People Planted</i>.</h3>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The original of the <i>Americans</i> much disputed on.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>About the Original of the <i>Americans</i>, the Learned Dispute so much, that
they find nothing more difficult in Story, than to clear that
Point; for whether inquiry be made after the time, when the <i>Americans</i>
first settled themselves where they now inhabit, or after what manner
they came thither, either by Shipping or by Land; on purpose, or accidentally;
driven by Storm, or else forc’d by a more powerful People, to remove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>from their old Plantations, and seek for new? or if any one should be yet
more curious, asking the way that directed them out of another Countrey to
this New World? or else enquire for those People, from whom the <i>Americans</i>
deriv’d themselves? He will find several Opinions, and the Learned still
Jangling.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Voyage l. 1. c. 8.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The time when <i>America</i> was first Peopled.</div>

<p class='c010'>The first Doubt is concerning the time: Mr. <i>Purchas</i>, where-ever he had the
Hint, endeavors to prove, that <i>America</i> hath been but lately Planted; for which
he thus argues, “That if <i>Asia</i>, or <i>Europe</i> furnish’d <i>America</i> with People in <i>Abraham</i>’s
time, or at least before the Birth of our Saviour; then it must upon
necessity, by the Expiration of so many Ages, have been much more Populous,
then the <i>Spaniards</i> found when first they discover’d it. Besides, the vast
Territories yet unhabited (says he) are sufficient testimonies, that this New
World hath been Planted but scatteringly, and not many Ages since, else
the Countrey would have more abounded with Inhabitants, because the fertility
of the Soyl was able plentifully to maintain Millions more, then were
there when first discover’d: And what Marks are better to know a new People
by, in any Countrey, than a rude Life and unsettled Government? just
like a Family removing to another House, which takes no short time to settle
their Goods and Houshold-stuff in a handsome and convenient Order.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The condition of the first World after the Floud.</div>

<p class='c010'>“When <i>Noah</i> went out of the Ark on Mount <i>Ararat</i>, and not long after, saw
his Seed spread over <i>Armenia</i> and <i>Assyria</i>, the new Generation of People consisted
in Shepherds and Husbandmen, that setled themselves near Lakes and
Rivers. Villages, Cities (and much less) whole Kingdoms, were scarce found
on the Face of the Earth, and as little of Trade or Commerce; Riches, Division
of Lands, costly Garments and Furniture for Houses, were not then in use, but
the works of long settlements in happy Peace. To curb growing-Wickedness,
and the Pride of <i>Libertines</i>, who incroach’d upon their weaker Neighbors,
Laws were invented, by which Bridle, the unbroke or wild World grew
tamer: And first, the <i>Assyrians</i> were brought to endure the Bit, and answer the
Reins of Government; then <i>Egypt</i>, next <i>Greece</i>, and after that the <i>Romans</i>, who
spreading their Power by Arms and Martial Discipline, first civiliz’d the
<i>Gauls</i>, <i>Spain</i>, <i>Brittain</i>, and lastly <i>Germany</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But because a Countrey or Pastoral Life, knowing no Commerce, but mean
Hovels, and to dwell in Huts, priding in poor and no Habits, despising all
greatness, unlimited by Laws, and all things else, (which the People observ’d
presently after the Flood) is now found among the <i>Americans</i>, who will take
them for ought else, but new Comers to that Land, as themselves acknowledge?
For the <i>Mexicans</i> boast, that they are the eldest there, and that from
them, <i>Peru</i>, <i>Chili</i>, <i>Chika</i>, and other Countreys towards the South, had their
Colonies, and yet the oldest Chronicles of <i>Mexico</i> reckon not above a thousand
Years.” Thus far Mr. <i>Purchas</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>America</i> was Peopled many Ages ago.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Purchas</i> contradicted.</div>

<p class='c010'>But certainly, all this Muster of appearing Reasons, is not able to vanquish
single Truth; For, grant that <i>America</i> was not very Populous when the
<i>Spaniards</i> first arrived there; must this needs prove, that it was never well inhabited
before? Perhaps the Civil Wars, which have been always destructive
to this Nation, have much hindred the increase of People; and the more, because
their Salvage Nature is such, that in several places they account Man’s
Flesh Broil’d a very great Dainty. And suppose such Prodigal Excess of their
Humane Bankets were not us’d in <i>America</i>, as indeed they are, Is it wonder, that
such a great part of the World, not onely exceeding <i>Europe</i> in bigness, but <i>Asia</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>also should here and there have a Tract of Land uninhabited? These might,
by reason of their Barrenness, be useless, as many such places are found in the
midst of the most Populous and fertile Countreys. But above all this, it is certain,
that <i>America</i> to this day (notwithstanding almost innumerable thousands
of <i>Indians</i> formerly Slain and Massacred by the <i>Spaniards</i>) is so well inhabited,
that it may stand in Competition with either <i>Asia</i> or <i>Europe</i>. And
how could such vast multitudes Plant the far-spreading Countrey of <i>America</i>,
without the help of many Ages? Moreover, This truth is not without sufficient
Testimonies; when any one looks on the Islands with which <i>America</i> lies
incompass’d, he may suppose they did not willingly go from the Main Continent
to the Isles, but were driven thither by Wars among themselves, or as
most times it happens, because of the vast increase of the Natives, the Countrey
must discharge its burden.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hereto is added, the several Languages us’d in <i>America</i>, as in <i>Europe</i> or any
other part of the known World; whereby we may easily guess, that <i>America</i>
was Peopled presently after the Confusion of Tongues at <i>Babel</i>. Furthermore,
If the <i>Americans</i> live a Rude Life, go meanly Habited, be without stately Houses;
such Customs are even among us observ’d by several People; as the <i>Tartars</i>,
<i>Numidians</i>, and others, which made their Antiquity be call’d in question. He
also must needs have no knowledge of the Arts and Mechanick Sciences us’d by
the <i>Americans</i>, who concludes, that they setled but lately in <i>America</i>. One Argument
at present will be sufficient to contradict them all; and in the further
Description, the contrary will be more manifest.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>American</i> Gold-Smiths.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Hieronimus Benso</i> relates, That he stood amaz’d at the Gold and Silver Smiths
in the Territory of <i>Chito</i>, who without any Iron Tools, made Images, and all
manner of Vessels: Which work they perform’d thus, First, they made an Oval
Crucible of a good Lock, round about Pasted with Earth, embody’d with
the Powder of Wood Coals; which Crucible being Bak’d very hard in the
Sun, they fill with Pieces of Gold or Silver, and put in the Fire; about which
standing with five, six, or more Pipes made of Canes, they blow the Fire so long,
till the Mettal melts, which others sitting on the ground, run it into Moulds
of black Stone, and so with little trouble, Cast into what shape they please.
Lastly, Though <i>Mexico</i> can reckon but a thousand years, must it therefore follow,
that the Inhabitants are no older? How many famous places (even
among our selves) have no longer Registers, and if they have, they are commonly
Fabulous, few Nations boasting truly their own Original; which Argument,
not onely contradicts (as we suppose) Mr. <i>Purchas</i>, but all others ascribing
the Plantation of <i>America</i> to our later times.</p>

<h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. I.</span></h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>After what manner the Inhabitants of <i>America</i> came thither.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>¶ In the next place, let us enquire, how the <i>Americans</i> were transmitted thither,
whether by Sea, or Land? Both which are feasible two several
ways; if they made an Expedition thither, as Discoverers, or were driven on
those Coasts by stress of Weather.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first is most unlikely, and not seeming possible, for how could they
Steer thorow so vast an Ocean, to Countreys they never heard of, without the
Compass, and other Necessaries for such a Voyage? for when first discover’d,
their want of experience in Shipping for so long a Voyage, knowing no further
than the use of small Boats or <i>Canoos</i>, plainly explode, that they willingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Steer’d from a known World, to an unknown, with no better accommodation;
but some probable reasons may be made out, to induce us to believe, that
they were rather driven thither by Storm.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_026.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>But some will say, How liv’d the little Boats, and how indur’d they in such
a continual Tempest, and were not either swallow’d up amidst the Waves, or
starv’d for want of Provision, which their hollow Troughs could not contain?</p>

<p class='c010'>The first doubt is the least, for there are Examples enough by which appear,
that oftentimes great Ships Bulging, are over-set or sunk in the Sea by foul Weather
when the Mariners escape in their Cock-Boat; and if they were but thinly
Victual’d for so long a Voyage, questionless, that little which they had, they
spun out, and made it last, while the impetuous Storm shortned the passage,
which fair Weather would have made much longer.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Plin</i>. l. 5. c. 22.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange voyage of a <i>Roman</i> Slave.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Pliny</i> tells us of <i>Annius Plocquius</i>, General of the <i>Red-Sea</i>, That one of his
Slaves being Enfranchiz’d, Sailing down towards the <i>Arabian</i> Gulf, was carry’d
by a violent Tempest from the North, beyond <i>Caramania</i>, and on the fifteenth
day came to an Anchor in <i>Hippuros</i>, a Haven of <i>Taprobane</i>, which <i>Ortelius</i>
judges to be <i>Sumatra</i>; but <i>Mercator</i> and <i>Cluverius</i>, on better grounds, <i>Zeylon</i>,
which is no less than three thousand <i>English</i> Miles.</p>

<p class='c010'>In like manner, <i>Joseph de Acosta</i> tells us, That in fifteen days time, he got
with a Northerly Wind from the <i>Canaries</i> to <i>America</i>, and his Voyage had been
shorter, durst he have born more Sails, which may partly clear the former
doubts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Peruvians</i> opinion concerning antient Sea-Voyages.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Acosta. Histor</i>. <i>Nat.</i> l. 2 c. 12.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Ridiculous opinion of the <i>Americans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, the <i>Peruvians</i> themselves give some small Testimony (in their antient
Records) of a few that Landed of old upon their Coasts, which were (as
they say) mighty and cruel Giants, committing much Bloodshed, Slaughtering
the Natives every where; and having subdu’d the whole Countrey, built stately
Edifices, of which remain yet the Ruines of some Foundations, very Artificial
and Costly. They also shew near <i>Manta</i>, and <i>Puerto Viejo</i>, many huge Bones, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>they believe of Giants, three times longer and thicker than an ordinary Mans.
They also tell us, that many Ages since, one <i>Ica</i> and <i>Arica</i> Sail’d Westward thither
upon Sea Wolves Skins, blown up like Bladders: But however, without
contradiction, the <i>Americans</i> never knew, much less built any such Vessels,
with which they durst venture to the <i>Offin</i>, out of sight of Land: their <i>Balsas</i>,
<i>Periagos</i>, and <i>Canoos</i>, will not all amount to the Bulk of one of our small Barques;
wherefore the Inhabitants of <i>Tumbez</i>, when they descry’d the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet, sent
to discover <i>Peru</i>, were amaz’d at the high Masts, spreading Sails, and bigness
of the Ships, judging them first to be Rocks, cast up out of the Sea; but observing
them to approach their Coast, and that they were full of Bearded-Men,
thought the Gods were walking in them; by our Modern Poet, Mr. <i>Dryden</i> in
his <i>Indian Emperor</i>, thus Elegantly describ’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Spaniards</i> carry Oxen, and Sheep to the <i>American</i> Isles.</div>

<p class='c010'>But the resolving these Doubts, starts a harder Question, <i>viz.</i> Grant that the
<i>Americans</i> were by Tempest driven thither, How then came the Beasts thither?
It is certain, that those which are beneficial for humane use, as Dogs for to
Hunt, great Cattel, Sheep, for Food, and other Necessaries, might easily be carry’d
thither, for so the <i>Spaniards</i> brought Cows, Horses, Swine, and other Cattel;
and also Poultery from <i>Spain</i>, to the new-discover’d Isles, <i>Cuba</i>, <i>Hispaniola</i>,
<i>Jamaica</i>, <i>Margaretta</i>, and <i>La Dominica</i>, when at their arrival, formerly no four-footed
Beasts were found there, whose fertile Soyl hath so multiply’d their
increase, that the Doggs running Wilde, and breeding as fast, do great hurt
to the Grazing Herds, which they onely shoot for their Skins, leaving their
Flesh, the best of Meats, onely to Manure the Ground on which they lie.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Transporting of tame and profitable Cattel might easily be allow’d of,
but who would load their Ships with Lions, Tygers, Bears, Wolves, Foxes, and
other Serpents and Voracious Beasts? it is certain that some may be tam’d
before they were Ship’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange accident of two Leopards.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Adv. Jovin.</i> l. 2.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Lampridius</i> relates, That <i>Heliogabalus</i> the <i>Roman</i> Emperor, took great pleasure
in Domestick Lions, and Leopards, to frighten his Guests withal; for with
the third Course, they were all brought in, and sate betwixt the Invited, a Man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and a Beast. The great <i>Cham</i>, as <i>Paulus Venetus</i> an Eye-witness attests, Rides on
Hunting, attended in couples with tame Leopards. The King of <i>Camboja</i> in like
manner is serv’d with Panthers: <i>Scaliger</i> adds also, That they went not unprovided
of a Lamb or Goat, to give the Panther, lest falling into his natural ferocity,
provok’d by hunger, he should make the Huntsmen his Quarry, if he
had no other Prey. But notwithstanding some wilde Beasts seem to forget
their Voracious Nature, yet there ought great care to be taken in the Transporting
of them, because they oftentimes grow wild again, which <i>France</i> can
witness, where two Leopards, a Male and a Female being tam’d, presently
after the death of King <i>Francis</i>, whether negligently or on purpose, let loose,
ran into the Woods, and near <i>Orleans</i> devour’d a great number of People, and
Cattel: <i>Gesner</i> saith, That some Womens bodies were found, who were untouch’d,
onely their Breasts eaten by the Leopards, as if they took them for
the daintiest part; which is not unlike the antient <i>Jeres</i>, who according to Saint
<i>Hierom</i>, entertain’d their Guests as a most delicious Dish, with Womens
Breasts, and Mens Buttocks Roasted. Besides, the devouring nature of these
Wilde Beasts, what profit could Tygers, Lions, Wolves, Bears, and the like
advantage the Transporter? And how came Serpents, Adders, and other Reptiles,
thither over the Ocean, that with no Art whatsoever can be made
tame? Were the small Vessels just laden with such terrible Creatures, when
against their wills, they were by Storm driven on a new Coast? By these impossibilities
we may easily judge, that the <i>Americans</i> came thither by Land,
and no other way, but how, and upon what occasion must be our next
enquiry.</p>

<h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. II.</span></h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Two reasons wherefore the people remove from their Countreys.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>¶ Histories generally gives us onely two accounts, Why People remov’d
from one Countrey to another, either not, or thinly inhabited; whether
driven by force, or of their own accord, so to unburthen and give ease to
their too Plethorick Countreys.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Flood acknowledg’d by the <i>Americans</i> and other <i>Heathens</i> but mysteriously.</div>

<p class='c010'>Thus the banish’d <i>Japanners</i> forsook their Native Countrey, and setled themselves
in a desolate Soyl, since a flourishing Empire, shining with Riches, and
Crown’d with stately Cities: So the <i>Batavians</i> took possession of the uninhabited
Isle, lying between the <i>Rhyne</i>, and the <i>Wael</i>, being driven out of <i>Hessen</i> by
Civil-Wars, and preserv’d the memory of the place, from whence they had
their Original on the utmost Point of the Island, in the Villages of <i>Cattenwyck</i>;
for the <i>Hessens</i> formerly went by the name of <i>Catti</i>; others that remov’d did
not onely fall upon their Neighbors, but made a way by force of Arms, chosing
their Habitations under a temperate Climate, and in a fruitful Soyl. After
which manner the <i>Franks</i> enter’d <i>Gaul</i>, and afterwards the <i>Normans</i> set upon
<i>France</i>; so that the Conquer’d Countreys, have ever since from the Conquerors
been call’d <i>France</i> and <i>Normandy</i>: But although it cannot punctually be
said, how the Inhabitants of <i>America</i> remov’d, yet it is without contradiction,
that they first found an empty Countrey. The Opinions which they have
themselves concerning it, are full of idle Fancies; First, they question their
Original from the Floud, which is so well rooted in the memory of all Nations,
that the blindest and most ignorant know something of it, though deformedly
alter’d and vary’d, tack’d up with additional fabulous Stories, the
truth it self known onely to us, but to all others lost in Oblivion.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Who hath not heard of <i>Deucalion</i>’s Flood, how his Wife <i>Pyrrha</i> and he only
escap’d in a little Boat, and (as ’tis Fabl’d) landing on a Mountain, from
thence Peopled the World again, by throwing Stones backwards over their
Heads? Something of this seems to hint the true Story of <i>Noah</i>, his Wife,
and Children, from whom the desolated World was replenish’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Prometheus</i> and <i>Noah</i> are the same.</div>

<p class='c010'>The same they relate of <i>Prometheus</i>, concerning whom, thus <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>:
“They say that the <i>Nyle</i> breaking through his Dams, and over-flowing
his Banks, drown’d all <i>Egypt</i>, especially that part where <i>Prometheus</i> Rul’d,
where all the Inhabitants were swallow’d by the Deluge.” None can imagine
but that <i>Diodorus</i> by this makes mention of a particular Flood, and not the
general one in <i>Noah</i>’s time; for as the <i>Greeks</i> ascrib’d all things to their <i>Heroes</i>,
so the <i>Egyptians</i> in like manner did the same to <i>theirs</i>: Therefore they have of
the general Flood, made a particular one in <i>Egypt</i>, though perhaps it never was:
So that what is Fabled of <i>Prometheus</i>, is nothing but a Part of the Universal
Deluge; which the Name <i>Prometheus</i> proves, because it signifies, <i>Sprung from
Heaven</i>, and is the same with <i>Noah</i>, whom they hold to be the first Father of all
Mankind since the Flood, born of, or regenerated from his Wife <i>Asia</i>; and <i>Asia</i>
signifies <i>Earth</i>, or <i>The Mother of all things</i>; and so espousing <i>Noah</i>, being sprung
from God, to <i>Ararat</i>, from whence descended the Generations of Mankind,
and by degrees spread over the whole surface of the Earth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Opinion of the <i>Americans</i> concerning the Flood.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Original of the <i>American</i> Kings, and their Custom.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Chineses</i>, <i>East-Indians</i>, <i>Japanners</i>, and other People of <i>Asia</i> and <i>Africa</i>, have
also some knowledge of a very ancient Flood; but hood-wink’t under many
idle Fancies, not unlike that which the <i>Americans</i> relate, from whom several
Learned Persons find no obscure Confessions of the Deluge, which thus mystically
they have wrapp’d up, That one <i>Viracocha</i> came out of the great Lake
<i>Titicaca</i>, and setled his Residence upon <i>Tiaguanaco</i>, where yet remain the Ruines
of ancient Walls, built after a wonderful manner: At length removing from
<i>Tiaguanaco</i> to <i>Cusco</i>, he began to multiply the Generation of Mankind. They
shew in the foremention’d Lake a small Island, under which, the <i>Americans</i> say,
the Sun sav’d himself from the Flood; wherefore in ancient Times they superstitiously
observ’d that place, heightning their Bloody Sacrifices with Humane
Slaughter. Others relate, That six Persons leap’d through a Hole out
of a Window, from whence all Men were since Extracted; and from that new
Increase, the place (after the Inhabitants of the Old World were all drown’d)
got the Denomination of <i>Pacari Tampo</i>; and therefore they hold the <i>Tampo</i>’s to
be the most ancient Families: From hence <i>Mangocapam</i> deriv’d, being the Primogenitor
of the <i>Ynca</i>’s or Kings; from whom sprung two Generations, <i>Hanon
Cuzco</i>, and <i>Urim Cuzco</i>. They tell us also, That their <i>Ynca</i>’s, when they make War
upon any People, say that the occasion, as they pretend, was, because all Territories
are Tributary to them justly, from whom they were deriv’d and restor’d,
being the first Planters of the New World; and withal, That the true
Religion was declar’d to them from Heaven.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Americans</i> Flood is taken out of the Scripture.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Relation, though mix’d with Fables, shews (but very darkly) that
they have some knowledge of the Flood: For who are those six else that
leap’d out of a Window to replenish the Generations of Mankind, but <i>Shem</i>,
<i>Ham</i>, and <i>Japhet</i>, with their Wives?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Peruvians</i> Opinion.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>And also the <i>Mexicans</i>, of their Original.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Lib. 1. cap. 7.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Americans</i> can give but a little better Account of their first Original;
and indeed it is no wonder, because for want of Books they can relate nothing
certain, but only what they have Registred in their usual <i>Quipocamagos</i>, which
is not above four hundred years old. <i>Acosta</i> asking what Original they judg’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>they were of, and from what Countrey and People deriv’d? receiv’d no other
Answer, but that <i>America</i> only was their native Countrey, and that they were
deriv’d from no other elsewhere. But though the <i>Peruvians</i> are of this Opinion,
yet the <i>Mexicans</i> are of another mind, giving the <i>Spaniards</i> a far better Account
when first they came thither, wherein we must a little deviate, <i>viz.</i> How
they were remov’d from some other place, as <i>Robert Comtæus</i> relates, who
with many Learned and seemingly true Arguments affirms, That the Original
of the <i>Americans</i> must be sought for either among the <i>Phenicians</i>, <i>Sydonians</i>, <i>Tyrians</i>,
or <i>Carthaginians</i>, being indeed all one People. <i>Herodotus</i> saith thus of the <i>Phenicians</i>,
“They liv’d formerly, according to their own Relation, along the Shore
of the <i>Red-Sea</i>; from whence removing, they planted the Sea-Coast of the
<i>Syrians</i>.” <i>Festus Avienus</i> the <i>Latin</i> Poet agrees with this Opinion, where he saith,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Original and Habitations of the <i>Phenicians</i>, of whom, according to several Learned, the <i>Americans</i> are extracted.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Aristotle</i> from a <i>Greek</i> Word calls them <i>Phenicians</i>, from their being red or
bloody with the Slaughter of all Strangers that Landed on their Coast; but
rather, and so indeed they are call’d <i>Phenicians</i>, or <i>Erythreans</i>, from <i>Esau</i>, or
<i>Edom</i>, from whom they are deriv’d; for these two Words, or Denominations,
signifie in <i>Greek, Red</i>; the two last, the like in <i>Hebrew</i>. <i>Phenix</i> himself
first planted all the Countrey lying between the River <i>Eleutherus</i>, and
the <i>Egyptian</i> City <i>Pelusium</i>; and afterwards <i>Damiata</i>, wash’d by the <i>Mediterrane</i>:
But since, these Boundaries are alter’d, on the North, by <i>Judea</i>; Westward,
by the <i>Mediterrane</i>; Southerly, by <i>Egypt</i>; and towards the East, by the
Desart <i>Arabia</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The chiefest Cities are <i>Ptolemais</i>, otherwise call’d <i>Acon</i>, <i>Sidon</i>, <i>Arad</i>, <i>Great Cana</i>,
<i>Sarepta</i>, <i>Biblis</i>, <i>Bothris</i>, <i>Berithus</i>, and their Princess <i>Tyre</i>, formerly scituate in
an Isle, but since joyn’d to the Main-Land by <i>Alexander the Great</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Salust</i> in <i>Igurtha</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Wonderful Power of the <i>Phenicians</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>None can disown, but that the <i>Phenicians</i> have every where been Admirals
of the Sea; so that they were formidable to the greatest Princes. When the
<i>Persian</i> King <i>Cambyses</i> came with a vast Army against the <i>Carthaginians</i>, he was
forc’d to give over his Design, because the <i>Phenicians</i> refus’d to help him with
their Fleet, being allied to, and the City founded by them: But they not only
built <i>Carthage</i>, which strove with <i>Rome</i> to be the Empress of the World, but also
the famous Cities <i>Leptis</i>, <i>Utica</i>, <i>Hippo</i>, and <i>Adrumetum</i> in <i>Africa</i>, with <i>Cadiz</i> and
<i>Tartessus</i> in <i>Spain</i>; nay, they sent Plantations of People into the Heart of <i>Iberia</i>
and <i>Lybia</i>. It will not be amiss to add <i>Q. Curtius</i> his Relation, who tells us,
“Where-ever the <i>Phenicians</i> came with their Fleets, Landing their Men, they
subdu’d whole Countreys, and by that means spread their Colonies over the
known World; <i>Carthage</i> in <i>Africa</i>, <i>Thebes</i> in <i>Boetia</i>, and <i>Cadiz</i> near the <i>Western
Ocean</i>.” <i>Aristotle</i> relates, “That they made such rich Returns of their Merchandize,
and chiefly of their Oyl, in <i>Spain</i>, that their Anchors, Pins, and
all Iron Materials belonging to a Ship, in stead of that Metal, were Silver.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Testimonies that the <i>Americans</i> are deriv’d from the <i>Phenicians</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>First Testimony.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Flemmish Islands.</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lib. 17.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>But to return to our Discourse, and disprove the former Testimony, That
the <i>Phenicians</i> found <i>America</i>. The formention’d <i>Comtæus</i> saith thus; “None
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>can justly doubt, but that since the <i>Phenicians</i> took the Command of the Sea
from the <i>Rhodians</i>, they more and more increas’d their Fleets, and growing
experter in Navigation, passing the <i>Gibraltar</i> Northward, became Masters of
<i>Cadiz</i>, and still prepar’d new Fleets, which searching beyond <i>Atlas</i> Southward,
discover’d the Coasts of <i>Africa</i>, and the adjacent Isles, driving a great Trade
to the <i>Canaries</i>, and to those which lay scatter’d along <i>Cape de Verd</i>, formerly
call’d the <i>Gorgades</i>. This way of Trade also was not unknown to the <i>Greeks</i>,
<i>Iberians</i>, and other People; but after the <i>Phenicians</i> assum’d it wholly to
themselves, without any respect or difference of Countreys, they sunk all
whomsoever they could catch.” <i>Curtius</i> further adds, saying, “I believe that
the <i>Phenicians</i>, sailing into the Main Ocean, have discover’d unknown Countreys.”
And which are those? Not the <i>Gorgades</i>, or <i>Canary Isles</i>; for those were
sufficiently known before; but a Main Land, far beyond. But though the <i>Phenicians</i>
were most expert, yet not skilful enough to make out such Discoveries.
They indeed were the first that before any other sail’d out of the Mid-land
Sea; nay, they ventur’d a good way into the main Ocean, beyond the <i>Straights
of Gibraltar</i>, or the <i>Herculean Pillars</i>: But how far? Not to the <i>Gorgades</i>, above
half way betwixt <i>Spain</i> and <i>America</i>; but to the <i>Cassiterides</i>, or <i>Flemish Islands</i>,
which to the number of nine lie in sight of <i>Spain</i>. <i>Strabo</i> affirms this Truth,
saying, “The <i>Cassiterides</i> are ten, lying in order close by one another: One
remains uninhabited; on the rest live a swarthy People.” This way the
<i>Phenicians</i> sail’d first, when they were in quest for Trade, from <i>Cadiz</i>. And
though he reckons ten, there are indeed but nine, <i>viz.</i> <i>St. Michael</i>, <i>St. Mary</i>, <i>St.
George</i>, <i>Tercera</i>, <i>de Pico</i>, or <i>Tenariff</i>, so call’d from the Mountain which vomits
Fire, <i>Fayal</i>, <i>Las Flores</i>, <i>Del Cuervo</i>, and <i>Gratiosa</i>. Moreover, the same <i>Strabo</i> relates,
“That the <i>Carthaginians</i> did not throw over-board the Traders on the remote
<i>Gorgades</i>, but those especially that came from <i>Sardinia</i> or <i>Cadiz</i>.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Vision.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Ancients believ’d Baboons to be Men.</div>

<p class='c010'>Mean while, we cannot deny, but that the <i>Gorgades</i> that lye before <i>Cape de
Verd</i> were frequented by the <i>Carthaginians</i>, long before the Birth of our Savior;
but with so much admiration, that <i>Hanno</i> their Captain in that Expedition was
listed amongst the number of their Heroes, hapning thus: The <i>Carthaginians</i>
sailing for <i>Cadiz</i>, to assist the <i>Phenicians</i> against the <i>Spaniards</i>, made that the Seat
of War, which soon drew on a greater Design; for <i>Hamilco</i> and <i>Hanno</i> being
impowr’d by the Senate at <i>Carthage</i>, manag’d the War in <i>Spain</i>. Both of them
were ambitious to discover new Countreys. <i>Hamilco</i> sail’d along the Coast of
<i>Spain</i> and <i>Gaule</i>, reaching to <i>Batavia</i>. <i>Hanno</i> steer’d Southerly, carrying thirty
thousand Men of all Trades in his Fleet, purposing to build a new City in
some place or other, and got beyond the Promontory <i>Ampelusium</i>, now call’d
<i>Cabo Spatil</i>; the River <i>Ziloa</i>, which washeth the City <i>Arzilla</i>; and the Stream
<i>Lix</i>, now <i>Lusso</i>, where the Poets place the Gardens of the <i>Hesperides</i>, in the custody
of a waking Dragon: From thence proceeding on his Voyage, he came
to an Anchor in the Mouth of the River <i>Subur</i>, at this day call’d <i>Subu</i>; and
afterwards before the City <i>Sala</i>, now call’d <i>Salle</i>, at that time made very dangerous
by the voracious Beasts in the neighboring Woods: At last the Fleet
reach’d the Foot of the lesser <i>Atlas</i>, which ends at the Point <i>Chaunaria</i>, by the
Modern Navigators call’d <i>Cabo Non</i>, because it was judg’d, that none could
scape with Life, that durst adventure to steer beyond <i>Chaunaria</i>; yet <i>Hanno</i>
sail’d between <i>Palma</i>, one of the <i>Canary-Islands</i>, and the Promontory <i>Bojadoris</i>,
towards the pointed Coast call’d then <i>Cornu Hesperium</i>, but now <i>Cape Verd</i>, in
the River <i>Asama</i>, by <i>Castaldus</i> call’d <i>Omirabi</i>: Here he found horrible Croccodiles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>and <i>Hippopotami</i> or Sea-Horses. <i>Atsama</i> is held to flow from the same Fountain
whence the <i>Nyle</i> hath its Original. In this Latitude <i>Hanno</i> descried those
Islands which he call’d <i>Gorgones</i> (from the three deform’d Sisters <i>Medusa</i>, <i>Sthenio</i>,
and <i>Euryale</i>, whose Heads were Periwig’d with curl’d Serpents) because
they found as illfavor’d Women on these Islands, which at this day the <i>Hollanders</i>
call the  <i>Salt-Islands</i>; amongst which, the chiefest is <i>St. Jago</i>, a Colony of <i>The
Portuguese</i>; but the Mountains opposite to the <i>Gorgones</i>, on the main Coast of
<i>Africa</i>, rising aloft with spiring tops near the River <i>Masitholus</i>, <i>Hanno</i> call’d the
<i>Chariots of the Gods</i>, now nam’d <i>Sierra Liona</i>, lying in eight Degrees Northern Latitude.
When <i>Hanno</i> and his Armado, either provok’d by an undaunted Courage,
or covetous of fame, if they proceeded in their so wonderful Adventure, went
forward, where they reported, that they saw Rivers of Fire falling into the
Ocean, the Countrey all about burning, and the tops of the Mountains dazleing
their Eyes with continual Flashes of Lightning, intermix’d with terrible
Thunder; adding further, That the Natives all the Summer shelter’d themselves
from the excessive Heat, in Caves under Ground; and coming forth in
the night, run abroad with lighted Torches over their Ground, so gathering
in their Harvest, and Officiating all other Affairs of Husbandry: Yet <i>Hanno</i> no
ways daunted at such strange Sights, sail’d from <i>Sierra Liona</i> Southerly to the
<i>Æquinox</i>, where he discover’d an Island not far from the <i>African</i> Coast, inhabited
by a rough and hairy People, to take some of whom, he us’d all possible means,
yet could not; onely two Women, being incompass’d by Soldiers, were taken,
and carried aboard; but being very salvage, and barbarously wild, could
not be tamed, or brought to any Complacency; so they kill’d them, and carried
their stuff’d-up Skins to <i>Carthage</i>, where they were a long time gaz’d upon with
great admiration.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Island <i>St. Thomas</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Island which <i>Hanno</i> then found, can be no other but that which we
call <i>St. Thomas</i>, and hath a very unhealthy Air for Strangers, but else very
fruitful, and abounding with Sugar-Canes; and the hairy People which he
makes mention of, were <i>Babeons</i>, or <i>Baboons</i>, which <i>Africa</i> in this place breeds
large, to the amazement of the Beholders, in great abundance; because
those deform’d Monsters, more than any other Beast whatsoever, represent
Humane shape.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Hanno</i>’s Return.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Is for his Voyage plac’d amongst the Gods.</div>

<p class='c010'>Here <i>Hanno</i> stopp’d his Voyage, being hindred from going further for want
of Provision. Five years he spent in this Expedition, before he Anchor’d
again at <i>Cadiz</i>, from whence not long after he steer’d to his Native Countrey
<i>Carthage</i>, where he was receiv’d with no less Wonder than State, insomuch that
none before or after him ever gain’d greater Honor, seeming to oblige his
Countrey with the hopes of future Profits from these new discover’d Regions:
Nay, he receiv’d a Name, and was plac’d amongst their Gods in the
Temples, which he being ambitious of, promoted after a strange manner,
teaching several Birds to cry, <i>The great God Hanno</i>; which when they could
speak perfect, they were let fly in the Air, where to the admiration of all People,
they every where repeated their well-taught Lesson.</p>

<p class='c010'>This the most remarkable Voyage which hapned in the time of the Ancients,
considering they wanted several Mathematical Instruments belonging to
Navigation, and especially the use of the Compass; and also considering the
length of the Voyage to <i>Sierra Liona</i>, whither never any durst venture before:
Nay, in so many Ages after <i>Hanno</i>, the famousest Navigators which were set
out by the King of <i>Portugal</i>, fear’d a long time to cut their Passage through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span><i>Æquinoctial-Line</i>; however in long Process of time, divers Experiments were
made, which have now so much improv’d the Art of Navigation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Testimony that <i>America</i> was not known to the Ancients.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Hanno</i>’s Voyage was four hundred years before the Birth of our Savior;
therefore if none have been further than <i>Hanno</i>, until the time the <i>Portuguese</i>
sail’d beyond <i>Cape de Bona Esperanza</i>, how could <i>America</i> be discover’d by Sea?
How did they steer from the <i>Salt-Islands</i>, or <i>St. Thomas</i>, out of sight of Land,
through the Main Ocean, to an unknown World? <i>Hanno</i> himself, who was the
stoutest of all Ancient Navigators, not only crept along the <i>African</i> Coast,
which made him spend so much time; but not daring to cross over those wide
spreading Bays he found, left not his hold of the Shore, and measur’d and
search’d every winding Inlet and Creek: And if he found a New World, why
was it not known? The more, because his Ambition carry’d him on to get a
Name and Reputation by such Naval Discoveries. And how true the Relation
of this Expedition is, <i>Pliny</i> tells us, saying, The Journal-Books were then
to be seen which <i>Hanno</i> writ in that his <i>African</i> Expedition: Though many of
the <i>Greeks</i>, and also of our Moderns, following <i>Hanno</i>, have found several
things contrary to his Observations, wherein he makes mention of several
Cities built by him, which none ever since heard of, or any have seen, neither
is there the least Marks of their Ruines to be found.</p>

<p class='c010'>This large Relation serves for nothing else, but to shew that they seek in
vain herein to give the Honor of the Discovery of <i>America</i> to the Ancients;
And as little do those Testimonies signifie that are taken out of <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>,
<i>Pliny</i>, <i>Pomponius Mela</i>, and <i>Ælian</i>. It will be worth our time to hear every
one of them particularly.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lib. 6. cap. 7.</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Second Testimony, that the <i>Americans</i> are deriv’d from the <i>Phenicians</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>First, <i>Diodorus</i> saith, “Beyond <i>Lybia</i>, in the Ocean, lies a very great
Island, several days sailing in Circumference, having a very fruitful Soil, and
pleasant Meadows, distinguish’d by Hills, and moistned by Navigable Rivers,
unknown in Ancient Times, because it seems to be separated from the
other World, and was thus found: The <i>Phenicians</i> sailing along the <i>Lybian</i>
Coast, were several days and nights toss’d with perpetual Tempests, and at
last driven to the foremention’d Island, where Anchoring, and observing the
pleasant Scituation thereof, made it known to their Magistrates.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Is contradicted.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>But how comes this nameless Island to be <i>America</i>? What Man would take
that for an Island, which far exceeds the main Continent of <i>Asia</i>? And have
the <i>Phenicians</i> ascrib’d the finding of this New World to any? Whence then
proceeds such great silence amongst all the Ancient Writers of a whole World,
who otherwise us’d to give Denominations to the least remote Village, or
Mountain, or River?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lib. 5. cap. 1.</i> Description of <i>Atlas</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Pliny</i> speaks after the same manner, saying, “The Writers make mention,
that <i>Atlas</i> rises out of the middle of the Sands, with a Shrubby and Bushy top
towards the Sky, on the Shore of the Ocean to which he gives his Denomination;
That it is full of Woods, and water’d by several Fountains on that
side towards <i>Africa</i>, by which means it bears all manner of Fruit. In the
Day-time none of the Inhabitants appear, all things being in silence, as in
the middle of a Desart; the Approacher is struck with sudden amazement.
And besides its excessive high Crown, reaching above the Clouds, and neighboring,
as they say, the Circle of the Moon, appears in the Night as if it
were all in a Flame, resounding far and near with Pipes, Trumpets, and Cymbals;
and the Journey up thither, very long and dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I cannot understand that <i>Pliny</i> can mean <i>America</i> by this, because himself, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the first Division of his Fifth Book, makes his beginning with the Description
of <i>Africa</i>: And as to what further concerns the strange Relation and danger
thereof, is a little before related in <i>Hanno</i>’s Voyage; and it is but a slight
Argument to prove it <i>America</i>, because it seems to resound with those sorts of
Instruments which the <i>Americans</i> were observ’d to use when discover’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lib. 1. cap. 4.</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Men.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Pomponius Mela</i> being the third, hath no greater Arguments than the former.
“We hear (says he) that utmost People towards the West, being the <i>Atlanticans</i>,
are rather half Beasts than Men, cloven-footed, without Heads, their Faces
upon their Breasts, and naked, with one great Foot, like Satyrs or Goblins,
which range up and down, without any Artificial Shelters or Houses.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lib. 3. cap. 18.</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Discourse between <i>Midas</i> and <i>Silenus</i> concerning the Unknown World.</div>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, <i>Ælian</i> seems to say something, when he sets down the Discourse between
<i>Midas</i> and <i>Silenus</i>, out of <i>Theopompus</i>, where <i>Silenus</i> relates, “That <i>Europe</i>,
<i>Asia</i>, and <i>Lybia</i> are Islands; and that a vast Countrey lyes beyond this
his tripple-divided World, mighty Populous, and abounding with all other
Living Creatures, as big again as ours, and living twice as long: That they
are wondrous rich; their Religions, Laws, and Customs, founded upon
another Morality and Reason, quite different from ours. They boast especially
of two great Cities, <i>Machimus</i> and <i>Eusebes</i>; the Inhabitants of the first
maintaining themselves by driving altogether a Trade of War, mustering
up, and filling their numerous Regiments with several valiant Nations. The
Listed Citizens amount in their Muster-Rolls, all bred to Soldiery, to two
Millions, of whom few but scorn either dying bravely by Wounds receiv’d
With Flint-edg’d Laths, and Staves, in stead of Spears, pointed with Stones,
not knowing the use of Iron or Steel, but so over-stock’d with Gold and
Silver, that they account it a Drug of less Value than our basest Metal.
Some Years since they march’d into our World, a hundred thousand strong,
as far as the <i>Hyperborean</i> Mountains, where being inform’d, that all the Nations
of our World, compar’d with them, liv’d in a poor and despicable
condition; as not thinking them worth their Conquest, they return’d. But
the second City <i>Eusebes</i>, deals altogether in Peace, and its Citizens are not rapacious,
but exercise Justice, so much affecting Morality and Divine Worship,
that they conquer Heaven by their Piety and Meekness, and the Gods
themselves are pleas’d to descend, and advise with them concerning their
Celestial Affairs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Who observes not this to be a Poetical Relation, shewing how much better
the Acquirements of Peace are, than those of War; the one conquering only
Men, the other, the Gods? Nor can more be taken out of <i>Ælian</i>’s Discourse,
but that the Ancients believ’d there was another Habitable World to be our
<i>Antipodes</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Inquiries whether the Constitutions of the <i>Phenicians</i> agree with the <i>Americans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Thus far hath been disputed concerning the Original of the <i>Americans</i>, whose
Plantations from <i>Tyre</i> or <i>Carthage</i> by Sea, are found altogether invalid: Yet
we will search a little further, to see whether the People Analogize, either in
their Religion, Policy, Oeconomy, or Customs.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is certain, that the ancient <i>Phenicians</i> liv’d in Tents, and sometimes exchang’d
eaten-up Pastures for fresh, which the <i>Americans</i> to this day observe;
by which it might appear, that they are of a <i>Phenician</i> Extract. But why not
as well deriv’d from <i>Numidia</i>, <i>Tartary</i>, or the ancient Patriarchs, who all liv’d
such an unsettl’d wandering Life? Besides, the <i>Phenicians</i> had a long time given
over Pastoral Business, for Maritime Affairs of greater consequence, not only
Merchandizing through all the World, but sending great Colonies in Ships to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>new Plantations: And moreover, the <i>Americans</i> could not so strangely degenerate
from their Ancestors, but would have built great Cities like them; of
which many were found in <i>Phenicia</i>, but none of Antiquity in <i>America</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>As also both their Religions.</div>

<p class='c010'>As to their Religion, if it agreed with the <i>Phenicians</i>, it was the same that all
the World profess’d at that time, and therefore may as well be extracted from
any other, as them: ’Tis true, we find them inclin’d to Sorcery, and dealing
with Evil Spirits, as the <i>Phenicians</i>, in which they were not only guilty, but all
other Nations at that time.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Known World formerly full of Witches.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>De Nat. Dæmon.</i> l. 3.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lucan.</i> lib. 6.</div>

<p class='c010'>Nay, why not as well transported out of <i>Asia</i> or <i>Europe</i>, where were formerly
many the like Tamperers, and those that dealt in such Diabolical Sciences? And
why not from <i>Salmantica</i>, where, as <i>Laurentius Ananias</i> relates, Magick-Arts
were publickly taught, and they commenc’d Doctors, and took their Degrees
according to their Learning? The Devil also hath publick Worship amongst
the <i>Americans</i>, and so he had with the <i>Phenicians</i>: yet not only they, but the
whole World had dedicated Temples to him. Here began Humane and Infernal
Sacrifices, supposing that Evil Spirits were delighted, and so feasted with
the Steam of Humane Offerings, whose sweetness made them milder, and so
intoxicating, lull’d them into less mischief.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Devil-worship formerly us’d in all the World, and now by the <i>Americans</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lev. 17. 6.</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Idols in Ships.</div>

<p class='c010'>How famous is <i>Zoroaster</i>, and the whole School of the Eastern Magicians?
In <i>Moses</i>’s time this Wickedness had already took place: Nor can it be deny’d
but that the <i>Phenicians</i> carry’d their Idols in their Ships, as <i>Herodotus</i> testifies,
saying, “The Image of <i>Vulcan</i> much resembles the <i>Phenicians Patacoioi</i>, which
they plac’d on the Fore-castle of their Ships.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In like manner, the <i>Americans</i> when they go to Sea, carry their Idols with
them; and the Ships took Name from the Image, which was either painted
or carv’d on the Stern, or plac’d elsewhere upon the Deck.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same Custom the <i>Chineses</i> observe to this present: <i>Francis Xaverius</i> relates,
“That he sail’d in a <i>Chinese</i> Vessel from <i>Goa</i> to <i>Japan</i>, which bore an
Idol in its Stern, before which the Master lighted Candles, perfum’d it
with Aloe-wood, and offer’d Birds and other Food, inquiring of it the
Event of his Voyage. Sometimes he judg’d from the Statues immovable
Looks, that it would fall out successfully; and other times, not.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>De abstinent. Animal.</i> l. 2.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Prepar. Evang.</i> lib. 1.</div>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, <i>Porphyrius</i> relates, “That the <i>Phenicians</i> upon any great Exigency, as
War, excessive Heat, or Mortal Distempers, by order selected one of the
most comely and beautiful of their Children, to be offer’d up to <i>Saturn</i>.” And
<i>Eusebius</i> saith also out of <i>Porphyrius</i>, “That <i>Saturn</i>, whom the <i>Phenicians</i> call
<i>Israel</i>, the Learned <i>Vossius</i> and <i>Hugo Grotius</i> read <i>Il</i>, or <i>El</i> (one of the ten
Names of God in <i>Hebrew</i>) which they also give to the Planet <i>Saturn</i>, who
when he Reign’d in <i>Phenicia</i>, having one only Son born by the Nymph <i>Anobret</i>,
and was in danger to lose his Kingdom, being worsted in an unlucky
War, he dress’d him in Royal Robes, and placing him on an Altar built for
that purpose, sacrific’d him with his own Hands.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Men and Children used for Sacrifices by the <i>Phenicians</i> and other People.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Who forbade the sacrificing of Men.</div>

<p class='c010'>And although such like cruel Oblations are us’d in <i>America</i>, must it therefore
follow, that they are deriv’d from the <i>Phenicians</i>, when several other People are
guilty of the same? Nay, there is scarce one Countrey, which hath not at
some time or other perform’d such inhumane Acts, seeming to them Zeal in
their Religion; for the most eminent of the Heathens scrupled not at it, which
certainly are held to be the <i>Persians</i>, <i>Greeks</i>, and <i>Romans</i>; and yet they were not
abhorr’d, though committing Humane Slaughters.</p>

<p class='c010'>This holy Butchery and Religious Slaughter of Mankind began in <i>Rome</i> in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>the Emperor <i>Adrian</i>’s Reign, so continuing till the time of <i>Tertullian</i>, <i>Lactantius</i>,
and <i>Eusebius</i>. The <i>Greeks</i> which inhabited the utmost part of <i>Italy</i>, employ’d
themselves daily in Sacrificing Strangers to <i>Saturn</i>, and sometimes one
another. But at last this formal Cruelty became a ridiculous Custom; for the
<i>Romans</i> by severe Edicts strictly forbad all such Humane Offerings: Yet that they
might retain some memory of their former Sacrifices, they order’d thirty Images
to be made of Rushes, which every year on the fifteenth of <i>April</i>, were by
the <i>Roman</i> Priests and Vestal Nuns, to be thrown from the <i>Milvian</i> Bridge into
the <i>Tyber</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lib. de Superstit.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, <i>Manethon</i> relates, “That the <i>Egyptians</i> in <i>Heliopolis</i> us’d to offer
three Men at once to <i>Juno</i>; which Custom was observ’d till King <i>Amasis</i> order’d,
That in stead of Men, they should serve her with Wax Candles.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Amestris</i>, Queen to the famous <i>Xerxes</i>, caus’d twelve Men to be burn’d alive,
as an Oblation, to pacifie and oblige <i>Pluto</i> to maintain them in their present
Grandeur.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Rer. Persic.</i> l. 1.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Procopius</i> relates of the People about the <i>Arabian Gulph</i>, “That they oftentimes
Sacrific’d Men to the Sun.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lib. 3. sect. 8 Geogr.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>“The <i>Indians</i>, saith <i>Pomponius Mela</i>, kill their nearest Relations and Parents,
before they decay by Sickness or Age, and judg’d it fit and most Religious to
Feast and Banquet themselves with the Entrails of the slain.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lib. 11. Geog.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Albanians</i>, as <i>Strabo</i> relates, offer yearly one of their Priests to the
Moon.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same <i>Mela</i> relates of the <i>Tauri</i>, That they us’d to cut the Throats of
Strangers, whenever they came near to the Place of their Sacrifice.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lib. 2. cap. 1</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Egyptian</i> Idol <i>Typhon</i>, as you may read in <i>Manethon</i>, was daily made red-hot,
and living People put in, and broyl’d to death.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Bell. Gall. Comm.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>But to pass by several other People guilty of such bloody Idolatry, How
did the Altars erected in the Woods in <i>Gaul</i> and <i>Germany</i>, for <i>Taran</i>, <i>Hesus</i>, <i>Teutates</i>,
and <i>Woden</i>, continually smoke with the Blood of Humane Expiations?
Of which <i>Cæsar</i> saith thus in his <i>Commentaries</i>; “The <i>Gauls</i> are a very Devout
and Superstitious Nation; and therefore when any were dangerously sick,
or likely to be worsted in Battel, they vow’d to feast their Gods that sav’d
them with Humane Flesh, and if need were, would make themselves a
thankful Sacrifice to those that help’d them off in such an Exigence. Concerning
these bloody Rites, they consulted and imploy’d the <i>Druydes</i>, by
whose advice they all believ’d that no Victim was so acceptable to the <i>Numens</i>,
as pour’d-out Humane Blood, but especially that of Malefactors;
which Dainty if they could not procure, their Gods must be treated with
the Lives of the Innocent.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>2 Reg. 3. v. 26, 27.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, the Holy Scripture saith thus, <i>When the King of</i> Moab <i>saw that the Battel
was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred Men that drew Swords, to break
through even to the King of</i> Edom; <i>but they could not. Then he took his eldest Son, that
should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a Burnt-offering on the Wall.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>These Testimonies are sufficient Witnesses, That the Ancient <i>Heathens</i> express’d
the height of their Devotion, and fury of mad Zeal, in such execrable
Rites, as to this day the like is practised by the <i>Indians</i>, <i>Chineses</i>, <i>Japanners</i>, and
others: Wherefore it can no ways be a sufficient ground to prove, that the
<i>Americans</i> are deriv’d from the <i>Phenicians</i>, because of their Humane Sacrifices,
for that they were usual Customs in all Places.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Third testimony, That the <i>Americans</i> are deriv’d from the <i>Phenicians</i>, because their Language agrees</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Is contradicted.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>The third Proof they offer us, is borrow’d from the similitude and likeness
of the <i>Phenician</i> and <i>American</i> Languages: <i>Comtœus</i> sets down some Words, <i>viz.</i>
the <i>Phenicians</i> call’d a Mountain, <i>Abila</i>; Blood, <i>Edom</i>; a Mother, <i>Anech</i>; a
Maid, <i>Hellotia</i>; Water, <i>Heni</i>, and <i>Jam</i>: With the first agrees the <i>American</i> <i>Anthla</i>;
with the second, <i>Holedonch</i>; with the third, <i>Anam</i>; with the fourth, <i>Hellotie</i>;
with the fifth, <i>Ame</i>, and <i>Jame</i>. But those that will thus corrupt the
Words, may as well make the unseemliest Comparisons. It is certain, that the
<i>Phenicians</i> and some of the <i>Americans</i> call a Cup <i>Asur</i>, and Red Wine, <i>Belàsa</i>;
But does it therefore follow by this, that the one is extracted from the other?
How many Names do signifie all one, amongst People that never had any
Conversation together? This proceeds only from meer accident; Or else if
some Words of one, sound like the same Words us’d in a remote Countrey,
and be of one signification, must they therefore be deriv’d from one another?
Then upon necessity the <i>Greeks</i>, <i>Latins</i>, and <i>Germans</i> had their Original from the
<i>Hebrews</i>, or the <i>Latins</i> from the <i>Greeks</i>, or the <i>Germans</i> from the <i>Latins</i>, or the
<i>Persians</i> from the <i>Germans</i>; or, on the contrary, the last owe their Extract to
the first. I will as a Testimony, and to give you a Pattern, pick out a few
from a greater number.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Greek</i> and <i>Hebrew</i> agree</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Also the <i>Hebrew</i> and <i>Latin</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>How little difference is there in many Words between the <i>Greek</i> and
<i>Hebrew</i>? The <i>Hebrews</i> call a Church-Congregation <i>Sanhedrim</i>, the Greeks
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Συνέδριον</span>; the Greeks for <i>I advise</i>, use <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πείθω</span>, the other <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">פתה</span>; the <i>Hebrews</i> call
Wise-men <i>Zophei</i>, the other <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σόφοι</span>: And less difference there is between <i>Symphoniah</i>
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Συμφονία</span>, <i>A well-set Lesson</i>; or <i>Psanterin</i> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ψαλτέριον</span>, <i>A Spiritual Hymn</i>:
And who also will not find a near resemblance in the consonating of divers
<i>Latin</i> and <i>Hebrew</i> Words? For there is little difference betwixt <i>Mesurah</i> and
<i>Mensura</i>, <i>a Measure</i>; <i>Shekar</i> and <i>Saccarus</i>, <i>a sweet Moisture</i>; <i>Levya</i> and <i>Leæna</i>, <i>a
Lioness</i>, <i>Sabbeca</i> and <i>Sambuca</i>, <i>a Chopping-board</i>; <i>Pesa</i> and <i>Passus</i>, <i>a Pace</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Likewise the <i>Teutonick</i>, the great Language of <i>Germany</i>, <i>Britain</i>, the <i>Low-Countreys</i>, and other Northern Nations.</div>

<p class='c010'>Then starting over the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i>, the <i>Teutonicks</i> would likewise produce
many Words which have the same sound and signification with the <i>Hebrew</i>;
as <i>Chobel</i>, <i>a Cable</i>; <i>Ethmol</i> and <i>Etmael</i>, <i>Watching</i>; <i>Sothim</i> and <i>Sotten</i>, <i>Fools</i>; the
<i>Hebrew</i> <i>Arets</i>, is in <i>Dutch</i>, <i>Aerde</i>, or as we in <i>English</i>, <i>Ear’d Lands</i>; <i>Phert</i> and <i>Peert</i>, <i>a
Horse</i>; <i>Levyah</i> and <i>Leeuw</i>, <i>a Lion</i>; <i>Shad</i> and <i>Schadea</i>, <i>Damages</i>; <i>Kisse</i> and <i>Kussen</i>, in
our Dialect the very same, <i>Kisse</i>; <i>Shaken</i> and <i>Schenken</i>, <i>a giving</i>, whence we derive
our <i>English</i> <i>Skinker</i>, from serving of Drink; <i>Bel</i> and <i>Beeld</i>, <i>an Image</i>; for <i>Bel</i>
properly signifies <i>Lord</i>, perhaps because the Images of Heroes or Lords were
worshipp’d by them, or else because <i>Ninus</i> first erected an Image for his Father
<i>Belus</i>, or <i>Bel</i>, to be worshipp’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> Tongues agree.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Abrah. Milii, Ling. Belg.</i> c. 5, 6, 7, 11.</div>

<p class='c010'>It would make a large Volume it self, to reckon up the Consonancies of
the <i>Hebrew</i>, <i>Greek</i>, and <i>Latin</i>, and their scatterings among all Languages where
ever their Empire spread, the one being indeed borrow’d from the other, as
all Languages that deal or have any converse together: For not only the
Words, with some small Alterations of Letters, signifie the same in both Languages;
but also without the least alteration. Both <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Latins</i> express
<i>I do</i>, by <i>Ago</i>; the Number <i>Eight</i>, by <i>Octo</i>; <i>an Arm</i>, by <i>Brachium</i> or <i>Brachion</i>, in
<i>English</i>, <i>Branches</i>, and <i>Braces</i>; <i>I eat</i>, by <i>Edo</i>; <i>a Cup</i>, by <i>Phiale</i>; <i>a Curtain</i>, by <i>Cortina</i>,

in both.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Phenician</i> and <i>American</i> Tongues have no similitude.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Americans</i> much divided in Speech and People.</div>

<p class='c010'>Now if there is not the hundredth part of the resemblance found between
the <i>American</i> and <i>Phenician</i> Tongues, as there is between the <i>Hebrew</i>, <i>Greek</i>, <i>Latin</i>,
and <i>Dutch</i>, according to the foremention’d Examples, which notwithstanding
cannot be observ’d to be deriv’d from one another, what testimony can there
be in five or six Words, which only have a few Letters that do not differ?
But suppose that the agreeing of the <i>Phenician</i> and <i>American</i> Tongues could
serve for a testimony; that these last People had their Original from the first,
then there remains another doubt, <i>viz.</i> To know what <i>Americans</i> acknowledge
the <i>Phenicians</i> for their Fathers; because their Countrey is so big, that it may
almost stand in competition with all the other three parts of the Known
World, being divided by so many Nations, which differ not only in their various
Customs, but also in their several Languages, most of them not having
the least likeness one with another: Nay, often times the Inhabitants of one
Province differ so much in Dialect, that, according to <i>Petrus de Cieca</i>, the one
cannot understand the other.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>John de Laet</i> observes out of <i>Peter Martyr</i>, and other Writers concerning the

is generally with all other Words, which agree not in the least one with the
other; so that every Territory hath not only a several Dialect, but in many
Places they use besides two, three, or more distinct Speeches, not relating in
the least one to another, in one Province, by which the People inhabiting
Towns and Villages are distinguish’d. The Islanders discover’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>,
and destroy’d, have left few Words behind them; yet <i>Peter Martyr</i> sets
down some of them, which were formerly us’d in <i>Hispaniola</i>: They call’d

<p class='c010'>Our last and chiefest Testimony is <i>Moses</i>, who says thus in <i>Genesis</i>, <i>Cursed be</i>
Canaan, <i>a Servant of Servants shall he be unto his Brethren. Moreover he said, Blessed
be the Lord God of</i> Shem, <i>and</i> Canaan <i>shall be his Servant: God shall inlarge</i> Japhet,
<i>and he shall dwell in the Tents of</i> Shem; <i>and</i> Canaan <i>shall be his Servant.</i> And
in the next Chapter, <i>Canaan</i> begat <i>Sidon</i>. These Scriptures are explain’d as a
Testimony of the <i>Americans</i> Extract from the <i>Phenicians</i>, which they ground on
these following Reasons: The <i>Phenicians</i> are <i>Canaan</i>’s Successors from <i>Sidon</i>,
who gave name to their chief City. <i>Tubal</i> the Issue of <i>Japhet</i>, whose Tents
God promis’d to enlarge, and that <i>Canaan</i> should be his Servant, planted <i>Spain</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>The <i>Phenicians</i>, descendants from <i>Sydon</i>, (say they) Peopled <i>America</i>; the <i>Spaniards</i>
sprung from <i>Tubal</i>, of <i>Japhet</i>, have subjected the <i>Americans</i>, descended from
<i>Sydon</i>, of <i>Canaan</i>; wherein is fulfill’d that Prophecy of <i>Moses</i>, <i>That</i> Canaan
<i>should be Servant to</i> Japhet; but it seems a great mistake, so to derive the <i>Phenicians</i>
from <i>Canaan</i>, for they are Extracted from <i>Shem</i>, <i>Heber</i>, <i>Abraham</i>, and <i>Esau</i>,
sirnam’d <i>Edom</i>, from his saying, <i>Adom, Adom</i>, when he ask’d of <i>Jacob</i>, <i>That Red,
That Red</i>, because he knew not how to call the prepared Pottage by its proper
Name; And <i>Edom</i> setling himself on Mount <i>Seir</i>, a part of the Stony <i>Arabia</i>,
and on the Coast of the <i>Red-Sea</i>, gave denomination to it, because that Sea
was much frequented and Navigated by his Successors. The <i>Greeks</i> call it <i>Erythreum</i>,
from <i>Erythros</i>, who is the same with <i>Esau</i>, and likewise signifies <i>Red</i>.
Hereto is added, That <i>Phænix</i> and <i>Erythros</i> have the same signification in the
<i>Greek</i>; So then, these <i>Idumeans</i> taking the name of <i>Phenicians</i>, from the great <i>Phœnix</i>,
spread themselves far and near under mighty Kings, by Navigation in the

Moreover, it may easily be demonstrated, that the <i>Phenicians</i> Extracted from

<div class='sidenote'>If the <i>Americans</i> were deriv’d from the <i>Jews</i>, or the ten Tribes of <i>Israel</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Is contradicted.</div>

<p class='c010'>Some would derive the <i>Americans</i> from the <i>Jews</i>; others, from the ten
Tribes of <i>Israel</i>, carry’d into captivity. The ground of which Opinions is,
That the <i>Jews</i> and <i>Israelites</i> were scatter’d amongst all Nations; therefore they
conclude, that <i>America</i> was also Peopled by them, the rather, because the antient
<i>Jews</i> and <i>Americans</i> were of one Complexion, and went a like Habited,
both going without Shooes, onely wearing Sandals, and an upper Coat over
a shorter Linnen Vest. Both are humble, quick of apprehension, and obliging,
yet Valiant: But it is certain, they cannot be like the <i>Jews</i>, because the <i>Americans</i>
change their Habit, according as they live in cold or hot Countreys, and
go not in the least like one another.</p>

<p class='c010'>Father <i>Immanuel</i> relates, That he saw a <i>Brasilian</i>, not onely stoutly make his
party good against three <i>Portugal</i> Soldiers, but had it not been by meer chance,
worsted them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, What Ceremonies of Religious Rites are observ’d by the <i>Americans</i>,
which are used in <i>Judaism</i>? The <i>Jews</i> indeed have transplanted their Circumcision
amongst divers Eastern People, and have they onely forgot the first Ceremony
and signal Badge of their Religion in <i>America</i>, which yet not onely
they, but those <i>Mahumetans</i> and other Sectaries punctually observe?</p>

<p class='c010'>This makes evident their scatterings about the Face of the Earth, but will
not bring them to reach <i>America</i>. The Sacred Text sets forth a two-fold description
of the <i>Jews</i>; The one before the Birth of our Saviour, when they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>liv’d as strangers in <i>Pontus</i>, <i>Galatia</i>, <i>Cappadocia</i>, <i>Asia</i>, and <i>Bythinia</i>. <i>Jerusalem</i> was
their Metropolis, although others had their chief residence in <i>Babylon</i>, and <i>Alexandria</i>;
for there was an <i>Asiatick</i> and a <i>European</i> dispersion; those of <i>Asia</i> had
<i>Babylon</i> for their chief City, and us’d in their Synagogues the <i>Chaldean</i> Translation
of the Bible. The <i>Europeans</i> kept their Seat at <i>Alexandria</i>, where they had
a Temple like that of <i>Jerusalem</i>; and whilst they employ’d themselves in the
<i>Greek</i> Version of the Holy Scripture, by the seventy two Interpreters, under
<i>Ptolomeus Philadelphus</i>, they were call’d <i>Wandering Greeks</i>: Therefore, certainly
the <i>Americans</i> are not deriv’d from these <i>Jews</i>, and with as little reason from
those, which by <i>Titus Vespasian</i>, after the destruction of <i>Jerusalem</i> were driven into
several Countreys, for they were never permitted (that I may borrow the
words of St. <i>Cyprian</i>) to set forward one step, though but as Pilgrims, towards
their Native Countrey, but strictly forbidden not to assemble or meet together
in any considerable number, which would have been necessary, if they intended
to Plant a new World.</p>

<p class='c010'>A small seeming Testimony is added, being taken out of the fourth Book
of <i>Esdras</i>, that the ten Tribes of <i>Israel</i> that were carry’d away by <i>Salmanassar</i>
with their King <i>Hosea</i> to <i>Nahalah</i>, <i>Habor</i>, the River <i>Gozan</i>, and the Cities of the
<i>Medes</i>, might be acknowledged for the first Planters of <i>America</i>: Concerning
which, <i>Esdras</i> saith thus, <i>The ten Tribes brought over into another Countrey, consulted
that they should forsake the multitude of the</i> Heathens, <i>and travel to a remoter Countrey,
where no Generation of Mankind had ever liv’d before, there they would maintain their
Laws, which they had not observ’d in their Countrey: Whereupon they went thither thorow
the narrow entrances of the River</i> Euphrates, <i>for the Almighty stopt the Vains of the River,
till they were past over; for thorow the Countrey was a way of a year and halfs Journey:
wherefore that Tract of Land is call’d</i> Assareth, <i>then they liv’d there till the last time.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>But since these Books of <i>Esdras</i> were not Written by a Prophet, either in the
<i>Hebrew</i> Tongue, or allow’d by the <i>Jews</i> to be the Word of God, or any where
taken notice of in the <i>New Testament</i>; wherefore then is <i>Assareth</i> more <i>America</i>

<p class='c010'>St. <i>Hierom</i> (who certainly had a peculiar knowledge of the condition of the
ten Tribes of <i>Israel</i>, because he liv’d in <i>Asia</i>, and held Correspondence with
the <i>Jews</i>, that he might perfectly learn the <i>Hebrew</i> Tongue,) relates, “That
the ten Tribes (St. <i>Hierome</i> liv’d about the Year four hundred, under the Emperor
<i>Theodosius</i>) underwent great slavery in the Cities of <i>Medes</i> and <i>Persians</i>;
so that this strange Voyage to <i>Assareth</i>, which must have happen’d long before
St. <i>Hierom</i>’s time, may be Recorded amongst the other Legends of the
Rabbies, concerning their <i>Behemoth</i> and <i>Leviathan</i>, who lock’d up the Souls of

<div class='sidenote'><i>Melchior Soiterus de Reb. Turc.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>And how little opportunity the <i>Israelites</i> had to remove since his time, may
appear by the horrible Destruction that was made for several Ages together in
<i>Persia</i> and <i>Media</i>; for although the <i>Persians</i> became Masters again of the Realm,
Conquer’d by <i>Alexander</i> the Great, whilst <i>Alexander</i>’s Successors invaded one
another, yet they were continually in War, either against the <i>Romans</i>, or else
the <i>Indians</i>, and other Eastern People; nay, the <i>Saracens</i> wrested the Scepter
out of their hand, though but for a small time; for soon after, breaking out
into Factions amongst themselves, <i>Muchumet Subictigenes</i>, <i>Imbrael</i>’s Son, establish’d
his Throne on their Ruines, and incourag’d by such success, Arm’d
himself against the <i>Indians</i>, and made use of the <i>Turks</i> assistance, with which
he subdu’d the <i>Babylonian Arabians</i>: After which, the <i>Turks</i>, not without great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>slaughter see the <i>Persian</i> Crown on their Head, which, immediately totter’d by
bloudy Commotions; for <i>Tangrolipix</i> being King of <i>Persia</i>, clashing with his
Brother <i>Cutlumuses</i>, made <i>Persia</i> swim in the Blood of a Civil-War, till at last
<i>Zengis Chan</i> brought from <i>Tartary</i> so great an Army, <i>Anno 1200.</i> that none durst
stay to make opposition; for the <i>Turks</i> forsook <i>Persia</i> after a Conquest of six
Ages, and made their own way for new Quarters into <i>Carmania</i>, <i>Phrygia</i>, and
<i>Bithynia</i>, whence they made such incursions on the <i>Greek</i> Empire, that at last
they became sole Masters thereof. Who cannot but easily judge by this, how
little opportunity the ten Tribes had, to be assembled together from remote
Countreys, and to go long Journeys through untrack’d ways, and full of Enemies,
to travel to <i>America</i>?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Mora</i>’s opinion concerning the <i>Americans</i> Extract.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Immanuel de Moraes</i>, who had gotten peculiar knowledge of the <i>Americans</i> by
his long Conversation with them, judgeth that they are not deriv’d from one
People, but from the <i>Carthaginians</i> and <i>Jews</i>, and that at several times, and places,
they Landed in this New World; for the <i>Carthaginians</i> Sailing thither,
found the Soyl so fertile, that many forsook their Native Countrey to dwell
there: Whereupon, it was forbidden upon pain of Death, to send no more
thither, lest if <i>Carthage</i> should be invaded by a foraign Enemy, it should want
People for a Home-defence: From this occasion it happen’d, that those that
were already Transported, became rude, and of a Salvage Disposition, and
spreading their Families, planted the desolate Countreys in a ranging manner,
without acknowledging any Supreme Head or Governor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus being scatter’d up and down, every one invented to himself a new
Language, which should neither agree with the <i>Carthaginians</i>, or any other:
But this Opinion is before at large contradicted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Customs and Constitutions of the <i>Brasilians</i> are several.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, <i>Moraes</i> endeavors to shew, that the <i>Brasilians</i> are of a <i>Hebrew</i> Extract,
because that according to the example of the <i>Jews</i>, they might not Marry,
but in their own Tribes; they also call their Unkles, Fathers, and their
Aunts, Mothers; both mourn for the Dead a Moneth together, and wear long
Garments down to their Ankles. But these Arguments seem to us of small
consequence, for indeed the <i>Brasilians</i> differ in their Marriages from the <i>Jews</i>,
for they not onely Marry in their own Tribes, but frequently commix with
their Sisters, and Daughters, or other their nearest Relations. Moreover, the
<i>Jews</i> call’d them Fathers, from whose Loyns they sprang many Ages before, as
well as their Unkles, which the <i>Americans</i> do not.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Mourning for the Dead hath been an old Custom, and is not observ’d
by many People, but the time of a Moneth was not setled amongst them, but
was observ’d after a more unusual manner, seventy days, as in the Fields of
<i>Moab</i> for <i>Moses</i>, and elsewhere for the Patriarch <i>Jacob</i>. Lastly, all people
know, that the <i>Romans</i> and <i>Persians</i> girt themselves about with long Clothes.
Besides, the <i>Jews</i> were strictly bound to observe Circumcision, without which
they were not accounted <i>Jews</i>, which the <i>Brasilians</i> use not, as neither their
Language or Letters. How is it possible, that in <i>America</i> they should at once
have forgotten their Extract, Laws, Circumcision, Language, and other Ceremonies,
when the rest of them observ’d nothing more strictly in all parts of
the Earth?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Grotius</i> is of opinion that the <i>Americans</i> belong’d to <i>Norway</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Learned <i>Hugo Grotius</i>, in his Enquiry after the original of the <i>Americans</i>,
brings them with many Circumstances to belong to <i>Panama</i>, situate opposite to
the Northern Parts of <i>Norway</i>, because something of their Languages agrees, and
the Way thither easie and nearest to be found: for first they travell’d from <i>Norway</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>to <i>Ysland</i>, over which the <i>Norwegians</i> Rul’d above a thousand years since; so
from <i>Ysland</i> through <i>Friezland</i> to <i>Groenland</i>, and from thence to <i>Estotiland</i>, being
a part of the Main Continent of <i>America</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>This Opinion is largely contradicted.</div>

<p class='c010'>From <i>Friezland</i> some Fishers went thither (as he says) two Centuries before
the <i>Spaniards</i> touch’d that Shore; which <i>John de Laet</i> contradicts. And indeed
what Reasons can be given, Why the <i>Americans</i> of the <i>Straights</i>, between
<i>Panama</i> and <i>Nombre de Dios</i>, lying Northerly, should have another original than
those that live to the South, seeing the same <i>Straights</i> are neither divided by
Mountains nor Rivers; and the <i>Spaniards</i> found no alteration in the Customs
and Languages betwixt them that liv’d above or below these <i>Straights</i>. And
who will believe that <i>Norway</i>, which was but indifferently peopled, could afford
such numerous Colonies as could plant the Northern <i>America</i>, which far
exceeds the South, and chiefly, when the great Islands that lie near the East
and West, are added to it? Moreover it is certain, (if the Yslander <i>Angrim Jonas</i>
is to be credited) that some Families fled out of <i>Norway</i> from their enraged
King to <i>Ysland</i> in the Year 874. which at that time was but meanly inhabited.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Isaac Pontanus de Reb. Danicis.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Forty years before, <i>Lewis</i> the Just put the <i>Yslanders</i> under the protection of
Pope <i>Gregory</i> the fourth, who gave the Government of the <i>Ysland</i> Church to
<i>Ansgar</i> Archbishop of <i>Hamburgh</i>. But how comes it that there is not the least
spark of <i>Christianity</i> found amongst the Northern <i>Americans</i>, if they are deriv’d
from the <i>Ysland Christians</i>? and why did the <i>Yslanders</i> remove to colder Countreys
than <i>Groenland</i> and <i>Friezland</i>, or their own native Soil, and for the most
part not inhabited?</p>

<p class='c010'>Concerning <i>Groenland</i> and <i>Friezland</i>, it is known by our <i>English</i> Navigators,
that they are joyn’d together, and both to the Northern <i>America</i>; but not without
vast Bays and Inlets, which betwixt <i>Groenland</i> and <i>America</i> are obstructed
with floating Castles of Ice; so that the Passage is very dangerous. And full
as troublesom, if not altogether impossible, would the Journey be by Land,
because the Earth lies so thick cover’d with Ice and Snow, especially the Valleys,
that no Traveller is able to get through.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, that which <i>Grotius</i> says farther of the Fishers which first discover’d
<i>Estotiland</i>, is grounded on the Relation of the <i>Venetian</i> Knights, <i>Nicholas</i>
and <i>Marcus Zeno</i>, two Brothers. <i>Anno 1380.</i> <i>Nicholas Zeno</i> suffer’d Shipwrack
on the <i>Friezland</i> Coast; <i>Marcus</i> inform’d thereof, steer’d his Course thither;
fourteen years they spent before they came to <i>Estotiland</i>: at last they return’d
again to <i>Friezland</i>, where <i>Nicholas</i> died: But <i>Marcus</i> returning home publish’d
his Journal, wherein he relates, That <i>Estotiland</i> is above a thousand Leagues
distant from <i>Friezland</i>, and was discover’d by <i>Friezland</i> Fisher-men that were
driven thither by Storm. But he hath set down many things that have little
resemblance of truth, according to what is since found by credible Navigators;
and therefore we cannot depend on <i>Zeno</i>’s Discovery.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>American</i> Tongue is nothing like the <i>Norwegian</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>John de Laet</i> accounts it a great mistake in <i>Grotius</i>, that as a testimony of the
<i>Americans</i> original out of <i>Norway</i>, he compares their Languages. He reckons
up some Places to be Northward of <i>Panama</i>, which end their words with the
syllable <i>Lan</i> instead of <i>Land</i>, because the <i>Spaniards</i> have left out the Letter D
at the end thereof. It is certain, that in the Northern <i>America</i> lie <i>Cimatlan</i>,
<i>Coatlan</i>, <i>Guescolan</i>, <i>Artlan</i>, <i>Quaxutatlan</i>, <i>Icatlan</i>, <i>Tapatlan</i>, <i>Cinacatlan</i>, <i>Tenuchitlan</i>,
<i>Comitlan</i>, <i>Metzitlan</i>, <i>Guatitlan</i>, <i>Necotitlan</i>, <i>Curcatatlan</i>. Besides, that most of these
Names are not of Countreys, but of Towns and Villages, and therefore no
ways fitting to have the termination of <i>Land</i>: and it is well known that many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span><i>American</i> words end with <i>Lan</i>, which signifie nothing less than Land: for
the <i>Mexicans</i> say <i>Puertatitlan</i>, which signifies <i>At the Gate below</i>; <i>Ochachitlantzitlan</i>,
<i>Yet lower</i>; <i>Tenoxtitlan</i>, (this City is also call’d from her Founder <i>Mexis</i>, <i>Mexico</i>)
that is, <i>Rests on a Rock</i>. Moreover, it may not without reason seem strange to
any, that the Northern <i>Americans</i> have remembred but three Cities out of all
the <i>Teutonick</i> Tongue, <i>viz.</i> <i>Lan</i> in stead <i>Land</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>We find not in any Author, that the <i>Norwegians</i> which liv’d along the Sea-shore,
ever went to seek a Way over the inaccessible Snowy Mountains of

<p class='c010'>Besides, <i>Grotius</i> stands for the <i>Norwegians</i> as Planters, upon testimony of the

there came from the <i>North</i>, first setling themselves on <i>Estotiland</i>, where to

<div class='sidenote'>The opinion concerning the City <i>Norumbega</i> in <i>America</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the <i>American</i> City <i>Norumbega</i>, live a People that speak the same Language,
and observe the same Customs with the <i>Mexicans</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this by-Corner are found also some <i>Alavards</i>, or <i>Longobards</i>, or <i>Lombards</i>,
as they say. Now the <i>Spaniards</i> call that <i>New Mexico</i> because last discover’d,
though indeed the old, cramm’d with People eight hundred years since: for
the <i>Mexicans</i> of <i>New Mexico</i> do not lie so far Northerly, as to the North-west:
for this <i>Mexico</i> lies in sight of <i>California</i>, which is believ’d to border on <i>Tartary</i>,
or at least separated from it by a narrow Channel. But <i>Norumbega</i> (if ever
such a Place was) must, according to the <i>West-Indian</i> Records, have been situate
where a part of <i>New France</i> lies, now planted by the <i>English</i>: between which
and <i>New Mexico</i> lies an almost unmeasurable vast Tract of Land. Mean while
here is not the least sign of this City <i>Norumbega</i> to be found: neither do the Inhabitants
dwell in Cities, but live in Tents, or moveable Villages, which
change their Names as oft as their Governors. Moreover, the <i>Norwegians</i> could
not get to this <i>Norumbega</i> by Land through <i>Ysland</i> and <i>Groenland</i> to <i>Estotiland</i>,
because of the vast Bays, and great <i>Midland-Sea</i>, discover’d by the <i>English</i> in

Customs with the <i>Norwegian</i>: for (says he) there is little difference between
<i>Pagod</i> and <i>by-God</i>, or <i>like God</i>; <i>Guaira</i> and <i>Waeijer</i>, that is, <i>A Fan</i>; <i>Ilama</i> and <i>Lam</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>in <i>English</i>, <i>Lamb</i>; <i>Peko</i> and <i>Beke</i>, a <i>Brook</i> or <i>Rivulet</i>. Both Customs and Constitutions
have also great resemblance. The <i>Mexicans</i> relate, that their Predecessors
onely follow’d Hunting; that they divided and reckon’d the Time,
not by Days, but by Nights, and wash’d their Children as soon as they were
born in cold Water.</p>

<p class='c010'>They are so much inclin’d to Gaming, that they venture their Liberty at it.
Every one is satisfi’d with one Wife, except some of the Nobility, which oftentimes
have more. They throw up high Banks in several places to damm
out the Sea; believe the Immortality of the Soul; every one eats at a peculiar
Table; most of them go naked, onely cover their <i>Pudenda</i> with a Cloth; some
Sacrifice and eat Mans-flesh: all which, according to <i>Tacitus</i>, <i>Pliny</i>, <i>Lucan</i>, and
other <i>Roman</i> Writers, was observ’d by the antient <i>Germans</i>; from whom those
that inhabit between the <i>Norwegian</i> Mountains were extracted.</p>

<p class='c010'>These Allegations, to make the <i>Norwegians</i> to be the Parents of the Northern
<i>Americans</i>, <i>John de Laet</i> thus contradicts: “It no ways follows that one
People take original from the other, because here and there are several words
found, that have the same signification and found in divers Countreys;
much less when they must either add, change, or diminish several Letters.
Moreover, there is no small mistake in the compar’d words: for <i>Pagod</i> is
not us’d all over <i>America</i>; the <i>East-Indians</i> about the River <i>Indus</i>, call their
Idol-Temples <i>Pagod</i>, or <i>Pagode</i>, the word <i>Guaira</i> is no where us’d in <i>America</i>,
but by the <i>Peruvians</i>, and with them not signifying a <i>Fan</i>, but a little <i>Oven</i>;
neither is <i>Ilama</i> a <i>Lamb</i>, (for before the coming of the <i>Spaniards</i> thither, neither
Sheep nor Lambs were ever seen in <i>Peru</i>) but a Wool-bearing Beast,
thus describ’d by <i>Joseph de Acosta</i>:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A description of the strange Beast <i>Ilama</i> in <i>Peru</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Ilama</i> (says he) a four-footed Creature, furnishes its Master with Meat
and Clothing, and supplies the office of a Beast for Burthens, and at no
charge for Hay nor Provender, well satisfi’d with what he finds in the Ways
or Mountains. But the <i>Ilama</i>’s are of two sorts, either woolly, or shorthair’d:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>the first go by the Name <i>Pacos</i>, the other <i>Moromoro</i>, being not much
less than a Calf, with a long Neck like a Camel, but of several colours; for
some are white, some black, and others speckled, having an odd Look, especially
when they are ty’d, and stand still without any motion, staring with
goggle-eyes on their Owners: Sometimes in a moody humor, upon a sudden
taking a freak, they run up to the top of almost inaccessible Mountains,
where both the frantick Beast and his Burthen are lost. The <i>Pacos</i> sometimes
likewise takes sudden Pets, and fustian Fits, often doing the forward <i>Supersalt</i>,
tumbling over and over with their Goods, and will not be rais’d, their moodiness
continuing, with beating, nay though they cut them to pieces: but the
best way is to sit down by them, and wait some hours till their humor being
spent they rise again of their own accords. These Beasts are much inclin’d
to a Disease call’d <i>Carashe</i> or the <i>Mange</i>, of which they generally
die: and because the Disease is very catching, they straight bury the infected
alive, so the better to preserve the rest.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Grotius</i> also mistakes, when he compares the <i>Mexican Peke</i> with the <i>Dutch
Beke</i>; for though many <i>Mexican</i> Places, Mountains, and Rivers, terminate in
<i>Peke</i>, yet it signifies not a <i>Brook</i> or <i>Rivulet</i>, for that they call <i>Atlauhtli</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>De Orig. Gentium Americ.</i></div>

<p class='c010'><i>John de Laet</i> tells also, That with great diligence he found a <i>Mexican</i> Dictionary,
Printed by the <i>Spaniards</i> in <i>Mexico</i>, to find if there were any words in it
which agreed with any of those <i>European</i> Languages that he understood, but
found not one.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is the same case with the Customs and Constitutions between the <i>Norwegians</i>
and Northern <i>Americans</i>: for what concerns Hunting, how many People
have formerly liv’d by it? The antient <i>Germans</i>, and to this day the <i>Tartars</i>
make it their whole business, excelling in that Art all other Nations. Besides,
that the more serious sort of the <i>Mexicans</i> many Ages since scorn’d to derive
themselves from a Hunting Ancestry, but affirm that they found the <i>Chichimecen</i>
in those Countreys, who were great <i>Venators</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Customs of the <i>Americans.</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Clothing.</div>

<p class='c010'>The accounting of Time by the Nights, extracted from the <i>Hebrews</i>, is observ’d
by divers Eastern People: and although the <i>Germans</i> dipt and wash’d
their children in cold Rivers, or Brooks, so soon as they were born, yet the
<i>Mexicans</i> never did it, but the Mother lays the Child on the fourth day after its
Birth, in an open place of the House, in the middle whereof stands a Pot full
of Water cover’d with Broom, in which they wash the Infant. Neither are
the <i>Americans</i> so much addicted to the Vice of Gaming as other Nations, so that
<i>Grotius</i> taxeth them too severely as to that point: as on the contrary, he too
much clears them of Polygamy, whereas the <i>Mexicans</i> Marry as many Wives as
they please, or are able to maintain. Father <i>Martyn Perez</i> relates the same of
the  <i>Cinaloans</i>, and other <i>Americans</i>; as also <i>Quarterius</i> of the Natives in <i>Nova Francia</i>,
which lie nearest to <i>Norway</i>. And what need the <i>Americans</i> have the <i>Germans</i>
their Teachers, to make Dams and Banks against Floods, since Nature and
Necessity it self instructs it? and where are any People so ignorant, as to
ascribe the same event to Men and Beasts after death? ’Tis true, their manner
of eating in <i>America</i> is several, because the People do not much converse
together: but they did not go naked; for the <i>Spaniards</i> found them not onely
neatly Habited, but had a proper Name for every thing they wore. The
<i>Virginians</i> us’d long Shirts; the <i>Floridans</i> Skins of wild Beasts; and towards the
North they cover’d themselves from Head to Foot in hairy and undress’d
Hydes. The sacrificing of Men was in former Ages spreading far and near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>over the World, and how far it was practis’d here, hath been already declar’d
at large. Lastly, all the <i>Americans</i> are not guilty of eating of Man’s-flesh, but
that salvageness is confin’d to the Southern <i>America</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus much we have said, to prove that the <i>Norwegians</i> had no hand in
planting the Northern <i>America</i>, we shall now proceed to enquire who planted
the Southern Parts, from the <i>Straights</i> between <i>Panama</i> and <i>Nombre de Dios</i>, to
the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Peruvians</i>, possessing a large Tract of Land along the Coast of the <i>South-Sea</i>,
<i>Grotius</i> would thus derive from <i>China</i>:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Relation of <i>Mancocapacus</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>“The <i>Peruvians</i>, being of a subtile Wit, and quick of Apprehension, argue sufficiently
that they are not extracted from the more Northern <i>Americans</i>, but rather
from the <i>Chineses</i>, which the several Wrecks of <i>Chinese</i> Ships found on
these Coasts sufficiently evidence: and no wonder, if curiosity or accident
brought the <i>Chineses</i> expert Navigators to this Countrey, separated onely by
one Sea from them. To this we may add their Rites of Religion; for both
worship the Sun, and call their King the Son of the Sun; they write no Letters
but make Characters downwards. <i>Mancocapacus</i> was a <i>Chinese</i> of strange
Policy; who being inform’d that his Countrey-men inhabited fruitful Countreys
on the other side of the <i>South-Sea</i>, but without Laws or Government,
Sail’d over thither, and gather’d the scatter’d Multitudes in a Body, and
establish’d an hereditary Kingdom after the <i>Chinese</i> manner, to him and his
Successors.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Americans</i> are not extracted from <i>China</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>To which <i>John de Laet</i> answers thus: “Though the <i>Peruvians</i> exceed the
other <i>Americans</i> in Policy, and at the arrival of the <i>Spaniards</i> liv’d in a
handsom Order of Government, yet they can no ways be compar’d to the
sharp-witted, and noble-spirited <i>Chineses</i>; nay, there are in no Place of <i>Peru</i>
found such Artificers as those of <i>China</i>, that bear the praise of all the World;
no where such manner of Buildings or Cities, nor the least likeness of the
<i>Chinese</i> Curiosities. As concerning the Wrecks found in <i>Peru</i>, I find no credible
Author that gives an account thereof: for certainly the <i>Chineses</i> could
much easier, and a nearer way have come through the <i>Atlantick Sea</i> to the
Coasts of <i>America</i>, lying to the East of <i>Peru</i>, than steer along the vast, and
much greater <i>South Sea</i>, and endure the horrible Storms and vast Waves,
which the <i>European</i> Ships are scarce able to endure, much less the <i>Chinese</i> Vessels,
which are not so good. The <i>Spaniards</i> which Sail yearly from <i>Acupulco</i>
to the <i>Philippines</i> are sensible of the great danger which they endure, chiefly
by the great gusts of Wind near <i>California</i>. Besides, the <i>Peruvians</i> before
the arrival of the <i>Spaniards</i>, were utterly ignorant of great Ships, and the use
of Sails. How could they at once have forgotten that Art, which they
brought with them thither, Moreover, it is easier to Sail from <i>Peru</i> to
<i>China</i>, than from <i>China</i> to <i>Peru</i>, because the Winds under the Equinoctial
Line commonly blow Easterly. And it is the greater wonder, that the <i>Chinese</i>
Jonks accidentally by Storm should be driven to <i>Peru</i>, because they
were never stor’d with Provisions but for a short Voyage, whereas this ask’d
nine Moneths. But if any one will suppose, that they purposely directed their
Course thither, how came the <i>Chineses</i> to Sail just to <i>Peru</i>, and not to <i>New
Spain</i>, which is much closer to <i>China</i>? why were there no Merchandises
of the <i>Chineses</i> found in <i>Peru</i>, since they went thither for Trade? how
came they to neglect that Navigation they had once found? Nor is their
Sun-worship (which was formerly practis’d in most Parts of the World) of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>any validity to derive them from <i>China</i>? But the contrary is most apparent,
for the <i>Peruvians</i> worship for their chief God, <i>Viracocha</i>, that is, <i>God Almighty</i>, or
<i>The Creator of all things</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The <i>Chineses</i>, if Confutius<a id='t35'></a> an eye-witness may be credited, are divided into
three Sects of Religion: The first follow the Learn’d <i>Trigantius</i>, and acknowledge
a King of the Heavens, which must onely be serv’d as the <i>Chineses</i> sole
Governor; to which purpose, two Temples are built in the Royal Cities
<i>Nankin</i> and <i>Pekin</i>, one Consecrate to Heaven, and the other to the Earth.
The second Sect hath the name of <i>Sciequia</i>, and serve the Idol <i>Omyto</i>. The
third nam’d <i>Lanzu</i>, imploy themselves in Magick and Exorcisms, Conjuring
up, and laying Evil-Spirits, whose horrid representations, when they
have stuck upon the Walls, they make an artificial and dreadful noise, as if
Hell were broke loose, and the House full of Devils; sometimes also force
the Evil-Spirits to enter into Images, from whence they receive no impertinent
answers to their questions: Therefore, who will compare this Superstition
of the <i>Peruvians</i> worshipping of the Sun, to the <i>Chinese</i> Religion,
which do no such things?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Embassy to the <i>Cham</i>, l. 2. c. 2.</div>

<p class='c010'>“The <i>Peruvians</i> call’d their King, <i>A Lord of the Realm</i>, and not <i>The Son of the
Sun</i>, as in <i>China</i>: Though the <i>Mexicans</i> otherwise worship the Sun, and in their
manner of adulation, styl’d <i>Hernando Cortez</i>, their Conqueror, <i>Son of the Sun</i>:
As to what concerns the manner of writing, it is very well known, that the
<i>Chineses</i> words are all Monosyllables, so that they have as many Letters as
Words, which they joyn so together, that they reckon eighty thousand,
but with ten thousand they are able to express themselves in most matters.
These Characters are contain’d in their <i>Halpien</i> or Dictionary. The antient
<i>Chineses</i> us’d seventeen several sorts of Characters in their writing, some consisting
of Serpents, that by several Wreathes and contortious Windings, signify’d
several things; others, of all sorts of agrestick Tools belonging to
Husbandry; some Characters of the Feathers of the Bird <i>Fum-hoar</i>; others of
Oysters and Worms, or of Roots, of Herbs, or Birds Claws, or of Turtles,
or of Herbs and Birds Feathers mingled, or of Planets, and such like; but
what manner of Writing or Hieroglyphick of theirs resembles those,
who by their own testimony know neither Pen, Paper, Ink, nor any manner
of Writing, but reckon the antiquity of time by strung Beads, which
was observ’d many ages since among several Nations.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Original of the <i>Americans</i> very obscure.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>What we may believe concerning them.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Americans</i> are derived from several people.</div>

<p class='c010'>Hitherto we have discover’d the several Opinions concerning the Original of
the <i>Americans</i>, or first Plantation of <i>America</i>, from all which, having receiv’d no
clear or demonstrative satisfaction, we must open our way to a further scrutiny:
But first, we must needs confess, that contradiction is not difficult; but it is something
of Work, when we have beaten down a well-fortifi’d Opinion, to set
up somewhat in stead thereof, to stand a permanent and undeniable truth,
which will be the harder, in regard the Inhabitants of this new World have
no old Chronologies concerning their Antiquities, and first settling there; yet
if we cannot go so far absolutely to assert, yet some probabilities, grounded (as
we suppose) upon better reasons, may give more satisfaction; for none will
deny, but that the Generations of Mankind being strangely multiply’d after
the Flood, they then living five times our Ages, and Wars not beginning till
the known part of the Earth was over-stock’d, justling for Territories, and
some thrust quite out, at last found <i>America</i>; which spreading it self to a vast
extent, and now found almost every where well inhabited, may be guess’d,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>that it was not onely Planted from the first, but several times replenish’d since
by various Nations; Why may not several Planters, and at several times make
room for their Colonies, incroaching one upon another, either by force or
compact; as the <i>French</i> themselves upon the <i>Gauls</i>, the <i>Normans</i> upon them,
the <i>Goths</i> among the <i>Spaniards</i>, and the <i>Saxons</i> among the <i>Brittains</i>, and the <i>Normans</i>
again upon them?</p>

<p class='c010'>Several people may easily Sail over thither, the <i>Azores</i> or the <i>Canary</i> Isles lye
so, that they are ready (as if design’d) for Transportation to <i>America</i>; from whence
<i>Acosta</i> made a Voyage in fifteen days. Also <i>Pliny</i> gives us an account, that these
Islands lay uninhabited in his time; yet is it well known, that after <i>Pliny</i>’s
time, Ruins of Buildings were found there, signifying, they had been formerly
Planted; and why might not those ancient Inhabitants Sail thence to the
neighboring <i>America</i>?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Marian. de Reb. Hisp.</i> l. 1. c. 18.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Tercera</i> lying half way between <i>Spain</i> and <i>America</i>, was frequented by Navigators
before the Birth of our Savior; and it seems as easie to Sail from thence
to <i>America</i>, as from the Main Land of <i>Spain</i> thither: Add this, that necessity
forc’d the <i>Spaniards</i> to look about them from other Countreys, for since they
lost their Victorious Champion <i>Baucius Gapetus</i>, they were every where beaten,
being tired out by the <i>Phenician</i> Forces, and that oppression over, suffer’d
as much under the <i>Roman</i> Yoke: Wherefore it seems not strange, if a considerable
number remov’d from thence, that they might live some where else
in quiet; for which purpose they wanted no conveniencies to Rig and set
forth stout and sufficient Vessels, able to live in those Seas, having had long
experience from the <i>Phenician</i> Voyagers, whose Fleets Sail’d daily to and again
in several Expeditions, from <i>Cadiz</i> and <i>Gibraltar</i> towards these Western Countreys:
Nay, <i>Hanno</i> himself their first Navigator that way, who gives an account
of the <i>Gorgons</i>, or the Isles of <i>Cape Verd</i>, a good part of the way to <i>America</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>English</i> famous Sea-men.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Barat-anac</i>, or, <i>Tinland</i>, the <i>Phenician</i> name, and <i>Brittania</i> the <i>Greek</i> name of <i>Brittain</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>And though <i>Brittain</i>, <i>Ireland</i>, and the <i>Brittish Orcades</i> lay further from <i>America</i>,
yet something may be said particularly to prove, That many Ages since, Expeditions
had been made from thence to the New World; and that the
Inhabitants of these our Isles, in former Ages, were peculiarly famous for their
skill in Navigation; insomuch, that the <i>Cretans</i> and <i>Phenicians</i> emulous of their
skill, and jealous of their danger, made several Attacques and Invasions upon
these Isles, which is the more probable, many remarks of the <i>Phenician</i> and
<i>Greek</i> Language, remaining in the denominations of the Countrey: Of which,
take first this account:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Old Voyage of <i>Madok</i> to <i>America</i>; for which see <i>Vet. Hist. Brit.</i></div>

<p class='c010'><i>Anno 1170.</i> When <i>Owen Guyneth</i>, Prince of <i>Wales</i>, having Raign’d long and
happily in his setled Dominions, dying, left several Sons, who quarrelling,
their elder Brother, as not contented with their shares of the Principality, nor
to be under him, having gotten no mean Interests and Claims to the whole by
their struglings, so weakned one another, that they open’d a way to the loosing
of all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>David Powel in Historia Cambriæ.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Amongst these Brothers, <i>Madok</i>, a Prince of a milder disposition, weary of
such unnatural Dissentions, threw up his share, better contented to seek new
Fortunes abroad; whereupon there were many soon perswaded to venture
their lives with him, where ever he would please to Transport: So Rigging
a small Fleet, he Sail’d Westward, far beyond <i>Ireland</i>, where at last he discover’d
an unknown and un-inhabited Countrey, but wondrous pleasant, the
Air being temperate, and the Soyl most fertile: Glad of this good success (as
the Story says) he returning, spreading the Fame of this his New-Found-Land,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>which they might exchange for a barren Soyl, hatter’d and harass’d with an
endless Civil-War.</p>

<p class='c010'>No small number flock’d to these Summons, as a most acceptable Undertaking;
so that soon after he was able to send forth ten good Ships, Freighted only
with Men, Women, and Children, and all other Materials fit for a new Plantation;
which not long after Landed in <i>Acuzamil</i>, a Countrey in the North of <i>America</i>,
as <i>Francis Lopez de Gomara</i> believes, because there he onely found some remaining
Tracks of Christianity, a People that worshipp’d the Cross, but
knew no reason why or wherefore they ador’d that sign of our Redemption.
Now, some will say, that this Worship of the Cross is no argument to prove, that
the <i>Brittish</i> Christians first Planted in the North of <i>America</i>; but what will not
time and change of place do, where Transplanted People keep no Records,
so they forget not onely Religion, Laws, and Customs, but who they were, and
from whence they came, Oblivion first mutilating, and at last swallowing up
all; of which, take this one late president.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange occasion of <i>De la Roche</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Anno 1598.</i> The Duke <i>De La Roche</i> obtain’d leave of the <i>French</i> King, to transport
a Colony of Volunteers to <i>New France</i>; in his way he Landed fifty Men on
the Island <i>De Sable</i>, to rest his Passengers, and that he might the better, and
with more ease explore the Countrey, and when resolv’d where to settle, then to
fetch them off; who accordingly, as design’d, soon after, returning thither,
was met with so violent a Storm, that not being able to Weather the Isle of
<i>Sable</i>, where he left his People, he lost his whole Expedition, and was driven
back to a <i>French</i> Harbor, where no sooner arriv’d, he was so highly charg’d,
that he was cast into Prison, when those he had left neglected upon the Isle, were
not once so much as thought of; in this interim, they never expecting to hear
more of their Captain, liv’d in a wild and miserable condition, feeding upon
Fish, and sometimes wild Swine, without Bread, Drink, or Salt.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Baron of <i>Leri</i> went with Letters Patents, to be Governor of <i>Nova
Francia</i>, and by stress of Weather in his Voyage, was forc’d to put in at <i>Sable</i>,
where he found the remainder of <i>La Roches</i> People, who being from fifty reduced
to twelve, having clad themselves in Sea-Wolves Skins, they had not
onely lost their former <i>French</i> Civilities, but forgot in a manner their Religion,
much of their Language, and what they were, being as if Metamorphos’d
into bestial Salvages.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If some did not come accidentally to <i>America</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>And although we have already controverted the improbability of Peopling
<i>America</i>, either by accident of Storm, or set purpose; yet it may be possible
that so it might happen, for as the several vertues of Plants, Herbs, Precious-Stones,
and Minerals, though strangely occult, and so altogether unknown,
that what could never be found by Art, meer chance hath brought to light, and
their wondrous qualities, some casual accident hath made apparent; so strange
and remote Countreys never to be found in our Charts, or Maps, nor Registred
in any Story, Seamen bound to their intended Harbors, have stumbled on by
chance, either Hood-wink’d by blind Mists, or forc’d upon by pertinatious
Weather; of which <i>America</i> may be her own witness, for how was <i>Columbus</i>
stirr’d up, but by incitations of the Journals of a Sea-Captain, dying in his
House, driven on the <i>American</i> Islands by foul Weather.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>America</i> was Peopled presently after the Flood.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Flood acknowledg’d there.</div>

<p class='c010'>Although from the foremention’d places, and after the same manner, <i>America</i>
might be furnish’d with Inhabitants; so it also gives us a more certain assurance,
that the Planting of <i>America</i> was not onely soon after the Flood, but
that they came also thither by Land: And how strangely would it be against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>the Majesty and Wisdom of Divine Providence, to leave half the Universal
Globe, a World fully supply’d with all sorts of Creatures, fit for Food and
Service, Plants, Herbs, and the richest Minerals, like a House new built,
and well furnish’d, without a Master or any Inhabitant, <i>viz.</i> Man, who being
of Celestial Extract, should be able to acknowledge and glorifie the Creator,
by admiring the Creature in his great Works: Besides, the confus’d Notions
and Fables of Giants, Perpetrators of all manner of Crimes, and wallowing
in all kind of sensual Debaucheries, are always remembred among the
Antiquities of the <i>Americans</i>, and that they had some slender hints of antient
Truth, not onely of the Giants before the Flood, but of those that soon after the
rank fatness of the Earth, produc’d and fed to that pitch of Arrogance, that the
covenanting Brethren defi’d God, fortifying themselves to fight him by the advantage
of that their long congested Pile, <i>Babel</i>, which in a short time was transverted
by the <i>Heathen</i> Poets into their <i>Gigantomachia</i>, heaping Hills on Hills, like
the <i>American</i> Traditions: From which we may conjecture, that they came thither
in the time of <i>Noah</i>; for why may not any believe, when <i>Noah</i> liv’d three hundred
years after he Landed on Mount <i>Ararat</i>, that he took care to People the
World? And who will make him ignorant of this New World, who living
five hundred years before, might not improbably by his own industry and
the help of the former long-liv’d <i>Patriarchs</i>, been well able to make a general
Survey of the Old; and he could better furnish <i>America</i>, it being nearer Mount
<i>Ararat</i>, than supply <i>Italy</i>, <i>Spain</i>, <i>Germany</i>, or any Northern Territories in <i>Europe</i>,
so that <i>America</i> might be known to the first people after the Flood, nay, inhabited
by them, though since that, the knowledge was lost.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Pliny</i> complaining of the Supine negligence, and stupendious sloth which
reign’d then and long before as he had observ’d, among all people, and in every
place, who were so far from making inquiry after discoveries of Lands for
new Plantations, that they lost the old, when they had begun to settle, though
under the greatest serenity of Peace; The Sea by that means lying open beyond
what any juncture of former times could be proud of.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Canary Islands</i>, by whom discover’d.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Hesperian</i> Gardens, what they signifie.</div>

<p class='c010'>Yet the <i>Fortunate</i>, or <i>Canary</i> Islands were in the first ages after <i>Noah</i>, frequented
with Vessels, which in later times were altogether neglected, till <i>Guillaum Betancourt</i>,
a Gentleman of <i>Picardye</i>, brought them again to be taken notice of by a
fresh Trade. The Fable of the <i>Hesperian</i> Gardens, and the Dragon that kept the
Golden Fruit, with constant Vigils, is nothing but an allusion to the Sea, which
with Serpentine Embraces, not onely secur’d these scatter’d Isles, but swallow’d
up several Adventurers that too hardy made their unhappy approaches
for discovery.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another Allegation for the Planting of <i>America</i> by Land, both whose sides
are wash’d on the East and West, by the South and Atlantick Ocean, may be
thus probably made out: The Atlantick rowls over with almost Fathomless
Waters, three thousand Leagues of Ground; the South-Sea not much less,
which well may be, being indeed but one continu’d Sea, encompassing, till
meeting there, the Universal Ball; whence springs a more likelyhood, that
<i>America</i> might be Planted from the Southern parts, from the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>,
and <i>Le-Mayr</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Relatio de Terra Australe.</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Description of the unknown South.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter Fernandes de Quir</i> relates, That he and a Commander, <i>Lodowick Paes le
Torres</i> saw a part of the South Countrey, and in it innumerable Inhabitants,
<i>Whites</i>, <i>Blacks</i>, <i>Sallows</i>, with long, black, curl’d, Woolly, and yellow Hair.
They know no Walls or Fortresses for Defence, Laws or Kings, but are divided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>into Tribes: They use indeed Bows, Arrows, Clubs, and a kind of Spears:
Their Houses are cover’d with Palm-Tree-Leaves; their Housholdstuff consists
onely of a few Earthen Pots, and such Trinkets; yet they have some little
skill in Weaving, and though they go naked, pride themselves in Neck-Laces
and Bracelets, made of Mother of Pearl: But these for their Complexions and
Constitution of Body, Customs, and manners, are rather deriv’d from the <i>Americans</i>,
than they from them, and therefore we must seek for their Original
from the North; from which are but two ways, one from <i>Ysland</i> and <i>Groenland</i>,
which <i>Grotius</i> endeavors to prove, but contradicted; the other out of <i>Tartary</i>,
which certainly was the first Nursery, from whence the <i>Americans</i> were
Transplanted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of <i>Tartary</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Tartary</i> or <i>Tattary</i>, so call’d from the River <i>Tatter</i>, which runs thorow the
Countrey <i>Mongul</i> into the Northern Ocean, covers a great part of the Terrestrial
Globe; the lesser <i>Tartary</i> makes out a considerable part of <i>Europe</i>; the
greater is <i>Asia</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This great <i>Tartary</i>, which is a thousand Leagues long, and six hundred broad,
reckons five chief Provinces, <i>viz.</i> the wild <i>Tartary</i>, inhabited by Herdsmen; <i>Sagatai</i>,
of which the Metropolis is <i>Samarcand</i>, famous for the mighty <i>Tamerlane</i>;
next <i>Turkestan</i>; then <i>Kitai</i>, which the great <i>Cham</i> Commands; and lastly, <i>Old
Tartary</i>, according to <i>Andreas Cæsariensis</i>, the habitation of <i>Gog</i> and <i>Magog</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now we must enquire from what <i>Tartars</i> the <i>Americans</i> are Extracted:</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Thrian</i> l. 67.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>If the <i>Israelites</i> were <i>Tartars</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Mornæus</i>, <i>Postellus</i>, <i>Genebrardus</i>, <i>Poterus</i>, and others are of opinion, That the
<i>Tartars</i>, which about the year 1228. under the Command of <i>Zingis Cham</i>
overspread the Earth like a deluge, were the Successors of the ten Tribes of <i>Israel</i>,
which were carry’d into captivity to <i>Assyria</i> by <i>Salmanazar</i>. The name <i>Tartary</i>,
or rather <i>Tattaria</i>, seems to be some testimony thereof, because it signifies
in the <i>Syrian</i> or <i>Hebrew</i> Tongue, <i>Remnants</i> or <i>Remainders</i>, as seemingly, because
these <i>Tartarians</i> were remainders of the foremention’d Tribes; nay, the Northern
<i>Tartary</i> Herdsmen preserve to this day the Names <i>Dan</i>, <i>Zabulon</i>, and <i>Naphthali</i>:
Wherefore we need not to admire, why so many <i>Jews</i> are found in <i>Russia</i>, <i>Sarmatia</i>,
and <i>Liefland</i>; nay, the nearer to <i>Tartary</i>, the more <i>Jews</i> there are.</p>

<p class='c010'>Circumcision hath a long time been observ’d among them, before <i>Mahomet</i>
brought in his new Law; it seems, that <i>Mahomet</i> order’d the Circumcision and
other Laws, according to <i>Moses</i>, to be observ’d by the Northern people, because
that in his time, they began to Rebel, that so they might the better be
kept in awe by their new Religion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Pand. Hist. Turcica.</i></div>

<p class='c010'><i>Joannes Leonclavius</i> relates, That in <i>Liefland</i> near <i>Riga</i>, he heard the wilde
Natives call’d <i>Letti</i>, not without great admiration, go crying along the High-Ways
and Fields, with a doleful voice, <i>Jeru, Jeru, Masco lou</i>:  It is believ’d that
they mourn for <i>Jerusalem</i> and <i>Damascus</i>; but by their long continuance in the
vast Wildernesses, they have forgot their Religion and Laws, and what else
might enable to tell us who they were. Several learned Authors question this
removal of the <i>Israelites</i> out of <i>Assyria</i> to <i>Tartary</i>, though to our Judgement their
Arguments are too weak, to take from them of the footing they have gotten
there; yet nevertheless, the <i>Israelites</i> are not to be taken for the Planters of
<i>America</i>, for why else is not <i>Judaisme</i> as well found in <i>America</i> as in <i>Tartary</i>. But
it is already shewn, that <i>America</i> was inhabited long before the dispersion of the
<i>Israelites</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Americans</i> are not deriv’d from <i>Africa</i> nor <i>Europe</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>But <i>Asia</i>, and chiefly out of <i>Tartary</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Now to shut up all, it is evident, that the first Planters of <i>America</i> were not
<i>Europeans</i> from the dissimilitude of the People, both in their Complexions, Language
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>and Persons; nor <i>Africans</i>, because that in all the far-spreading Countrey
of <i>America</i>, not one <i>Negro</i> is to be found, except a few near the River <i>Martha</i>,
in the little Territory <i>Quarequa</i>, which must by Storm be drove thither
from the <i>Guinny</i> Coast: So that <i>Asia</i>, the Mother of all People, onely remains
to be Implanter of our <i>America</i>, whose Western Coast, opposite to <i>Asia</i>, is more
inhabited than to the East, where it respects <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Tartary</i> is not parted from <i>America</i> by the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Anian</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, <i>Armenia</i>, out of which, by <i>Noah</i>’s Progeny, the whole Earth was
re-peopled, borders on <i>Scythia</i>, now call’d <i>Tartary</i>, and <i>Tartary</i> faces <i>America</i>,
separated onely by the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Anian</i>; though some are of opinion, that
out of the South into the Frozen Sea, there is no passage thorow these <i>Straights</i>,
else (as we have already prov’d the contrary) how came all those Voracious
and Poysonous Beasts into <i>America</i>, if it be clearly separated from <i>Asia</i> by
Sea?</p>

<p class='c010'>It deserves here to be related, what happen’d to <i>Henry Cornelison Schaep</i>, and
<i>William Byleveld</i>, Sailing from <i>Batavia</i> to discover the <i>Tartarick</i> River <i>Polysange</i>,
but were taken and carry’d Prisoners to the <i>Japan</i> Court at <i>Jedo</i>; being Commanded
there by Order of the Councel to give an account of a <i>Japan</i> Map or
Card, which was laid before them, and contain’d the Provinces of <i>Japan</i>, <i>Amboina</i>,
the <i>Molucca</i> Islands, <i>Manilha</i>, the <i>South-Sea</i>, <i>Borneo</i>, <i>Celebes</i>, <i>Malacca</i>, <i>Tartary</i>,
<i>Formosa</i>, <i>Corea</i>, and the vast and Mountainous Countrey or Desart of <i>Jesso</i>, separated
from <i>Japan</i> by the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Sungar</i>; though toward the North, it joyns to
<i>Japan</i> in the Province of <i>Ochio</i>; and beginning in forty seven degrees, run
North-East towards <i>America</i>, but they could not possible find the <i>Straights</i> of
<i>Anian</i>; but on the contrary, the Promontory of <i>Tartary</i>, <i>viz.</i> the Province <i>Kataya</i>
or <i>Katui</i> lay in the same parallel with the Northern <i>America</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Ennead</i> 9. l. 6. Testimonies that the <i>Americans</i> are <i>Tartars</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Hereto may be added, that <i>Asia</i> hath no Territory any where, which may
more easily with numerous Colonies supply <i>America</i> than this part of <i>Tartary</i>, as
well for the vastness of the Countrey, to which no other can compare, as for
the increasing of the Inhabitants: Who doth not admire, that according to
<i>Michalon  Lithouwer</i>, there is scarce a City in <i>Tartary</i> that boasted less than a thousand
Temples? and to see <i>Canguista</i> first King of <i>Tartary</i>, about the Year 1200.
in Arms; and his Successor <i>Hoccata</i> following his Fathers bloody Footsteps,
whilst he prepar’d his Sons with three vast Armies? The eldest Son, <i>Jachis</i>,
March’d Westward with thirty thousand Horse; <i>Batho</i> drew with as great an
Army towards the North; <i>Tagladais</i> being the youngest fell into the <i>Moores</i>
Countrey above <i>Egypt</i>. <i>Hoccata</i> himself March’d victoriously into the North
<i>America</i>, subdu’d great part of the <i>Persian</i> Kingdom, and beat the <i>Turks</i>, led by
the General <i>Goniata</i> with a great Army, <i>Anno 1241.</i> as <i>Jacob Planensis</i> and <i>Benedictus
Sarmata</i>, two <i>Monks</i>, sent by Pope <i>Innocent</i> to <i>Hoccata</i>, witness: The great
number of the <i>Tartars</i> or <i>Scythians</i>, may appear by the several people, spread
far and near over <i>Tartary</i>; <i>Pliny</i> reckons some of them, <i>viz.</i> <i>Auchetes</i>, <i>Neuri</i>, <i>Geloni</i>,
<i>Thussagetes</i>, <i>Budini</i>, <i>Basilides</i>, <i>Agathyrsi</i>, <i>Nomades</i>, <i>Anthropophagi</i>, <i>Hyperborei</i>,
<i>Arimphei</i>, <i>Cimmerij</i>, <i>Cicianthi</i>, <i>Georgi</i>, <i>Sacores</i>, and others: What number would
the Inhabitants make up that live in <i>America</i>, in <i>Teneneuf</i>, <i>Virginia</i>, <i>Florida</i>, <i>New
Spain</i>, <i>Guadalaiara</i>, <i>Guatemala</i>, <i>Terra firma</i>, <i>New Granada</i>, <i>Peru</i>, <i>Chili</i>, <i>Rio de la Plata</i>,
<i>Brasil</i>, <i>Guaiana</i>, <i>New Andaluzai</i>?</p>

<p class='c010'>It will be worth our time, to compare the likeness between the <i>Scythians</i> and
Northern <i>Americans</i>; both of them are differenc’d with special Marks of a more
than ordinary and natural distance between the Eyes, which much alters the
whole Air of the Face, and the plumpness and swelling of their Cheeks summits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>above the Cheek-bone; most of these are of a middle stature, having
downy Hair upon their Chin, like the Callow Feathers of an unfledg’d Bird.
Lastly, as the <i>Tartars</i>, they differ amongst themselves in their Customs, yet in
several things they agree one with another, according as they are govern’d by
others, and yet other Princes, some powerful, and some weaker, according as
every ones power be more or less. The Inhabitants of <i>Lucaja</i> bear so great a
respect, and stand so much in awe of their Governor, that if commanded to
leap from a Rock, and break their Necks, they instantly obey.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same is observ’d by the <i>Tartars</i>; the first King <i>Canguista</i> Commanded
the seven Princes of his Realm to Murder their Sons with their own Hands,
which they all readily perform’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Constitutions of the <i>Tartars</i> and <i>Americans</i> agree.</div>

<p class='c010'>In <i>Popaina</i> they live to this day like some <i>Tartars</i>, without Laws or Law-givers,
who change their places by turns, from the great increase of the <i>Tartars</i>,
the <i>Americans</i> no ways differ.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Bartholomeus de las Casas</i> writ to <i>Charles the Fifth</i>, That the <i>Spaniards</i> in few
years, onely on the Islands <i>Cuba</i>, <i>Hispaniola</i>, <i>Naco</i>, <i>Hondures</i>, in <i>Venezuela</i> and
<i>New Spain</i>, destroy’d above 2600000. Men, besides the slaughter that was made
in <i>Peru</i>, <i>Brasil</i>, <i>Rio de la Plata</i> and other places, which far exceed the foremention’d
numbers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Polygamy is still in use, both among the <i>Tartars</i> and <i>Americans</i>; both acknowledge
the Immortality of the Soul, both like <i>Cannibals</i>, Eating and Sacrificing
Mans flesh. How famous amongst the Antients was the Altar of <i>Diana</i>
in <i>Taurica Chersonesus</i>, where several Men were daily Sacrificed? How delicate,
according to <i>Sabellicus</i>, did the <i>Tartars</i> account their Dishes, Sauc’d and
serv’d with humane Gore?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Geogr.</i> l. 11 q. 7.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Strabo</i> relates, That the antient People account it an honourable Death to be
chop’d in pieces, and their flesh serv’d up in Commons. Those that die by
Age, a natural death, are despis’d like Malefactors, and as a punishment according
to their Demerits, left in the open Fields, a prey to Birds and Beasts;
some delight in that loathsome gorging themselves with Mens flesh, others on
the contrary, not onely detest humane, but all manner of flesh: And just so
the <i>Americans</i> are distinguish’d, for although the <i>Caribes</i>, <i>Brasilians</i>, the Inhabitants
of <i>New Spain</i>, <i>New Granada</i>, <i>St. Martha</i>, and others, Sacrifice and eat Men,
yet as many abhor and detest that odious Diet and abominable Custom.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Giles Flesher</i> Queen <i>Elisabeths</i> Agent in <i>Muscow</i> relates, That <i>Anno 1588.</i> <i>Kinach
Morsey</i>, Grandson to the Governor of the <i>Chrim Tartars</i>, made his entrance there
with a Retinue of three hundred Noblemen, and two Ladies, of which one was
the Widow of his deceased Brother. The great Prince inform’d of their coming,
sent him two slaughter’d Horses, whose sides and Hanches they feasted on,
as we on Fallow Deer.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Devil-worship in <i>Americ</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Most of the <i>Tartars</i> use no manner of Letters or Characters; in the Voyage
made into <i>Persia</i>, they first learn’d to make Letters; just so it is in <i>America</i>;
their bemoaning of the dead ends in one Moneth, both by the <i>Tartars</i> and <i>Americans</i>;
with a Person of Quality, the <i>Tartars</i> bury a live Servant; the same
Custom is observ’d by some of the <i>Americans</i>; and so much do they agree in a
salvage and rude life, that Merchandizing and Mechanicks are little regarded.
<i>Ayson</i> the <i>American</i> acknowledges the <i>Tartars</i> for a rude People in their Religion,
Habits, and Dwellings, and yet in all these the <i>Americans</i> differ but very little.
Lastly, How common is it amongst them to worship the Devil? Along the
River <i>Sagadahoc</i>, the Inhabitants are every new Moon miserably tormented by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>an Evil Spirit call’d <i>Tanto</i>. In the Temples in <i>Virginia</i> remain yet the horrible
Images of the Devils <i>Oka</i> and <i>Menetto</i>. Not a House in <i>Mexico</i>, but hath a peculiar
Chappel, set apart for this their suppos’d holy, but damnable Adoration
of the Devil. Others in <i>Virginia</i> believe, That there is a great and supreme Deity,
which is Everlasting, and for ever. The <i>Tartars</i> also are of the like perswasion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Tartarian</i> Horses.</div>

<p class='c010'>But this Opinion <i>Grotius</i> hath laid a strong and dangerous Battery against,
that <i>America</i> could not be Peopled by the <i>Tartars</i>, because the <i>Americans</i> before
the <i>Spaniards</i> coming thither, had never seen any Horses; whereas the <i>Tartars</i> use
no Beast more, either in Peace or War, nor can less want: For the <i>Tartarian</i>
Forces do not only consist in Horse; but the Wealth of this Countrey is
reckon’d up in the numerous Breeds of Horses, and several Studs of Mares.
Some of the Nobless keep a thousand Horse; none, though never so poor,
but keep two or three; and Beggars there mounted crave Alms and Charity
of the People. When they remove their Habitations, their Horses carry their
Provisions and Tents: If Provisions grow short, they eat Mares Milk, high
gusted with Garlick, which satisfies Hunger and Thirst; and the red Liquor
which they tap warm from their Veins, serves them to help Digestion, and
heighten their Humor, instead of the Blood of the Grape, our sweet Wine.
The swiftest Rivers, though raging and precipitated with Land-floods, they
dare adventure swimming their Horses over, hanging naked by their Manes,
and guiding them by a slipp’d Rein whither they please: To their Tails they
tie their Saddles, and other Necessaries, bound up in Rushes. When a Person
of Quality prepares to cross any River, they tie two Horses Tail to Tail,
and athwart both their Backs fasten a Mat pleited of Rushes, to sit on. When
they are stopp’d at any broad River, or standing Lake, they kill and flea their
worst Horses; then turning the Skins inside out, and well Liquoring, they
stretch them open with the Ribs, which stand like the Bayles of a Tilted Wherry,
and thus furnish’d, serves them for a Boat to carry eight Persons. When
they take the Field, going to War, not any but musters three Horses; which
makes their Armies, when drawn out in Campain, shew much bigger than
indeed they are: And though many of them are kill’d in the Wars, or slain
for Food, yet the <i>European Tartars</i> pay yearly forty thousand Horses to the <i>Russians</i>;
from whence <i>Grotius</i> thus argues, “If <i>America</i> joyns to <i>Tartary</i>, then
the Horses which run wild at Grass might easily have found <i>America</i> themselves,
seeking to improve their Pasture, and have gone from one Countrey
into the other, as it appears, that since the <i>Spaniards</i> transported Horses to
<i>America</i>, they are dispers’d over the highest Mountains, out of one Province
into the other: Or if the <i>Straights of Anian</i> run between both, the <i>Tartars</i>
never were Navigators; and suppose they had been, they would not have
cross’d without Horses, without which they knew not how to subsist.” To
which we only say thus, That although <i>Tartary</i> now, and in former times,
abounded in Horse, yet must we grant, that it hath been always so? or that
the ancient <i>Scythians</i>, who we avouch first planted <i>America</i>, had such frequent
use of them as the <i>Tartars</i> now. This may be controverted, for that these
<i>Scythians</i> planting there in the Non-age of Time, presently after the Flood,
the use of Horses was unknown, which the Ancient Poets testifie by their Fiction
of <i>Centaurs</i>, who when first seen, the Horse and Rider were taken for
one Creature. The like mistake the <i>Mexicans</i> had, when they saw the mounted
<i>Spaniards</i>, a thousand running away from one Cavalier.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>As to their coming thither of themselves, it may easily be confuted: Who
knows not, that there is no Countrey a continu’d Pasture, but luxurious Vales
separated with inaccessible Mountains, Lakes, and vast Wildernesses. But <i>David
Ingram</i> relates, “That he saw some Horses in the Northern <i>America</i>, which
the  <i>Mexicans</i>, and other Conquests of the <i>Spaniards</i> never heard of:” Whereupon
we may conclude, and we suppose without all peradventure, That the
<i>Americans</i> have absolutely their Original from <i>Tartary</i>, which bordering <i>Armenia</i>,
where <i>Noah</i>’s Ark first rested, hath a convenient way, though beyond the
<i>Artick Circle</i>, through a temperate Climate betwixt Heat and Cold, to <i>Cathay</i>, in
the same Parallel with the neighboring <i>America</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Christoph. Colonus</i>’s Birth.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Christopher Colonus</i>, generally (though by mistake) call’d <i>Columbus</i>, was
born in <i>Arbizolo</i>, a Village in the Dominion of <i>Genoa</i>, near <i>Savona</i>; his
Father liv’d by Fishing in the Midland-Sea: So that <i>Sebastian Schroter</i>,
and others besides him, are mistaken, saying, <i>Colonus</i> was born in the City <i>Cucureum</i>,
and descended of the Noble Family <i>Pilistrelli</i>: For <i>Peter Bezarus</i>, <i>Colonus</i>
his Countrey-man, gives unquestionable Proofs of his mean Extract; and
amongst other things, That the Common-wealth of <i>Genoa</i> refus’d to receive
the great Legacy which <i>Colonus</i> left them in his Will, because they fondly
thought it a derogation to their Honor, being so great a Republick, to take
any thing of Bequest from a Fishers Son: Yet his Majesty of <i>Castile</i> thought
otherwise, not onely enriching him with Wealth, and a fair Revenue for his
Discovery of the <i>West-Indies</i>; but also, though of a low derivation, rais’d him
to great Honor, Ennobling him the first of his Family with Dignities, Titles,
and Escutcheon, which rank’d him in place among his Prime Nobility.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Colonus</i>, whom we shall henceforth call <i>Columbus</i>, spent his Youth near the
Sea, where he was busie exploring the Winds, considering their Natures, and
the Quarters whence they rose, especially with the setting of the Current from
the <i>Atlantick</i> to the <i>Mediterrane</i>. The Western Winds, which often, as well as the
<i>Levant</i>, blow several days together from the great Ocean, much amusing him,
hinted at last some Notions, that there might be another World, and new Places
to be discover’d, beyond the setting of the Sun; and that the <i>Ne plus ultra</i>
should not be, if he could help it, the commanding Terminary of the Earth
that way. He also spent much time, being of a solid Judgment, in the Emendations
of Charts and Maps, then very much improvable: And the <i>Portuguese</i>,
who at that time had got the start in Navigation from all other People, being
then busie to find a way by the South of <i>Africa</i> to the <i>East-Indies</i>, not contented
to go by hearsay, he went himself in Person a Voyage with them. Soon after
<i>Columbus</i> settled himself in the Island <i>Madera</i>, where an Accident hapned,
which <i>Francis Lopez de Gomesa</i> relates thus: “The Master of a Ship, whose
Name and Countrey lies buried in Oblivion (though some would have him
to be of <i>Spain</i>, some an <i>Andalusian</i> or <i>Biscayner</i>, and others a <i>Portuguese</i>) Trading
the <i>Canaries</i> and <i>Flemmish-Isles</i>, was surpris’d by a hideous Tempest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>from the East, which hurried him <i>nolens volens</i> through dreadful Waves,
where at last he found himself ingag’d upon a Western Coast, altogether unknown.
The Storm ceasing, without making further Discoveries, he pick’d
his way homeward, at last Landing in the Haven of <i>Madera</i>: All his Crew
but three and himself, with hardship, want, and the long Voyage having perish’d,
himself dangerously sick, was carried into <i>Columbus</i> his House; where
lying on his Death-Bed, he bequeath’d to <i>Columbus</i> his Maps, Journals, and
other Observations of this his unfortunate Voyage.” <i>Columbus</i> being by these
Papers more confirm’d than ever in his Opinion of a New World in the West,
declar’d what he verily believ’d, to the States of <i>Genoa</i>; but they look’d upon
him as a vain and idle Fellow; yet <i>Columbus</i> full of his great Project, thus
slighted and scornfully rejected, sate not so down, but address’d himself to
the King of <i>Portugal</i>, where they wearied him, spending long time with dilatory
Answers, to no effect; the Opinion of a whole Court of expert Navigators
having cast his Declaration out, as a <i>Chimera</i> or meer Fancy. Soon after
<i>Columbus</i> sending his Brother into <i>England</i>, to move the Business to King <i>Henry</i>
the Seventh, he being taken Prisoner by the way, and lying long er’e his Release,
came too late to the <i>English</i> Court, prevented by the News of <i>Christopher</i>’s
return with Success from his intended Voyage: For mean while <i>Ferdinando</i>
and <i>Isabella</i> King of <i>Castile</i>, having finish’d his Wars with the <i>Moors</i>, had furnish’d
him out for the Expedition; which he effected by the favor of <i>Alfonso
Mendotio</i> and <i>Alfonso Quintavilia</i>, both great Ministers of State under <i>Ferdinand</i>
and <i>Isabel</i>, and obtain’d so much at last, that he was sent with a hundred and
twenty Souldiers, besides Sea-men, in two Ships, and one Pinnace. Thus supplied,
he set Sail from <i>Cadiz</i> upon the Kings account the fourth of <i>August,
Anno 1492.</i> and first reach’d the <i>Canary-Islands</i>, and from thence steering
South-West, the Wind in thirty three days scarce varying one Point: But
though the Weather blew so constant, yet the Sea-men chang’d their Minds,
and Storm’d quite contrary, crying, That <i>Columbus</i> was guilty of all their
Deaths: <i>For</i> (said they, after they had lost sight of the <i>Canaries</i> so many days,
nothing appearing but Sea and Sky) <i>Who can hope for any Success or happy conclusion
of so desperate a Voyage, so rashly undertaken, and found now so full of eminent danger?</i>
Yet <i>Columbus</i> bore bravely up, and weather’d all their Exclamations, although
they threatned no less than his Murder: At last Articling, they came to this
Agreement, <i>That if after sailing forwards three days more, no Land were discover’d,
they should return</i>: But about two a Clock the next Night, <i>Columbus</i> saw a glimmering
like Fire in the Sky, and in the Morning found himself close aboard
a most pleasant Coast, where Landing with twelve Men, he erected a Cross
cut out of a Tree. Thence he sail’d over to <i>Cuba</i>, where the Sea was so rough,
that he was forc’d to stand off, fearing Rocks and Shallow Water. Soon after
he got to the Northward of the Island <i>Haytin</i>, which he call’d <i>Hispaniola</i>: Here
his best Ship was bulged upon a Rock, on which they had all perish’d, had it
not been flat on the top, so that the Soldiers and the whole Crew of Sea-men
were sav’d by the two Vessels. The Inhabitants stark naked, seeing these
Strangers, fled to the Woods; but the <i>Spaniards</i> overtaking a Woman, they entertain’d
her with Sweet-meats and <i>Spanish</i> Wine, and putting her on a white
Shirt, sent her again to the rest of the Natives, where return’d, she told what
good Entertainment she had had to her Companions; whereupon divers of
the Islanders came aboard of the <i>Spaniards</i>, in Boats made of one piece of
Wood, where they barter’d Gold for Beads, pieces of Glass, Knives, Shells,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and other Trifles. The King of <i>Guaccanarillo</i> gave testimony of peculiar inclination
to the <i>Spaniards</i>, helping them to Fish up the remaining Goods of the
Wreck, and inform’d them, That some Rivers flowing from the tops of high
Mountains, wash’d down the Gold amongst the Sand: notwithstanding a
strange Prophecy had been told to these Islanders, namely, <i>That Bearded Men
out of remote Countries should destroy their Goods, take their Land, and massacre their Children</i>.
He also told them what made them fly, and betake them to their Heels
at the arrival of the <i>Spaniards</i>, because they were oftentimes surpris’d by the
<i>Cannibals</i>, who snatch’d up all they could lay hold on: Their Boys and Striplings
they gelded, cooping and cramming them up, as we our Capons, for
Feasts: The young and well-grown Men they chopp’d to pieces, salted, and
Barrel’d up: Young Women they preserv’d for breed, and old ones they made
Slaves. These <i>Cannibals</i> were so terrible to the Inhabitants of <i>Haytin</i>, that a
thousand of them durst not venture to engage against ten, but would run every
way, dispers’d like Flocks of Sheep before the Wolf.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, Their King permitted the <i>Spaniards</i> to build a Lodge or Hovel,
wherein thirty or forty of them might shelter; but indeed so taking possession
in right of the King of <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mean while <i>Columbus</i> return’d in safety to <i>Spain</i>, and was receiv’d with great
joy, King <i>Ferdinand</i> making him Admiral of the Sea, and sending his Brother
<i>Bartholomew</i> Governor to <i>Haytin</i>, now call’d <i>Hispaniola</i>. The Gold, Parrots,
Mastick, Aloes, the strange Bread <i>Jucca</i>, whose extracted Juyce is rank Poyson,
but the Body makes good Meal, which kneaded and bak’d, yields a fine Manchet
and wholesom Food, they look’d upon with great delight and admiration;
but two of the Natives being naked, with Gold Rings through their Noses
and Ears, Ornaments with them of high esteem, and signifying their no
mean Quality, the People old and young came in Throngs to wonder at, never
weary of gazing upon them. But the King, encourag’d by this Success,
took no dilatory Course, but suddenly, and before any could expect, built
fourteen stout Carvels, and three Frigats, and as soon mann’d them with
twelve hundred Soldiers, besides a great number of Artificers of all sorts, with
their Wives and Children, freighting them with Horses, Swine, Goats, Cattel
for Breed, all sorts of <i>European</i> Corn to sow, Fruit-Trees and Vines to plant,
and some Priests to instruct and convert the Natives to their Religion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Huts of the <i>Cannibals</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The second of <i>September</i>, <i>Anno 1493.</i> they set sail from <i>Cadiz</i>, and Anchor’d
before <i>Ferreo</i>, the last and furthest of the <i>Canary-Islands</i>, where they could get
no Water, but what dropp’d from the Dew hanging on Trees into Troughs.
After that, <i>Columbus</i> came on the one and twentieth day amongst the <i>Caribby-Islands</i>,
where he dropp’d Anchor before one, which he call’d <i>Dominico</i>; but
finding it desolate, set sail further, and discover’d several other Coasts, where
he likewise found nothing but very great Porcupines or Hedg-hogs, and sweet-smelling
Trees. Steering forward, he found the Coasts of the <i>Cannibals</i>, which
inhabited along the Shore in little Huts or Hovels, built round of Wood,
and stak’d about on the out-side with long Poles, like <i>Palisado</i>’s: They have
also Posts within, which are shorter, pleited and fastned together with Cotton,
or long Roots of Trees, plyant like our Osiars, over which they hang
Cloths painted with horrible Figures and strange Representations: The Roofs
rise like our Canopy’d Tents, highest in the middle, cover’d with Palm-Tree
Leaves to keep off the Rain: At the Entrances hang two Hairy Images on
Poles, not for Religion sake, but Ornament: Their Bed-steads being high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>from the Ground, are fill’d with a kind of Straw; and in long Hovels fitted
for that purpose they store their Sugar.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Island <i>Guadalupe</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Columbus</i> landing here, found all the <i>Cannibals</i> fled; but their Houses full of
Stone Vessels, Cruises, Pans, and Pots, boyling with Mens Flesh, Parrots, and
Wild-foul; the Hanches and Sides of young Men, on Spits roasting at the
Fire, with the Splinters of whose broken Bones they headed their Arrows.
This Island by the Inhabitants call’d <i>Carucueria</i>, <i>Columbus</i> chang’d to <i>Guadalupe</i>,
because the Mountains rise up with their tops not unlike <i>Estremadura</i> in <i>Spain</i>,
famous there for the wonderful Representation of our Lady, as that of the
Lady of <i>Loretto</i> in <i>Italy</i>. Thirty Women which he had taken from the neighboring
Isles, he sent with Presents to the fled <i>Canibals</i>, which the next day returning,
made a great appearance near the Shore; but when they had gaz’d a
while upon the <i>Spaniards</i>, looking stedfastly on one another, they suddenly ran
back again, sheltring themselves in the Covert of the Woods. <i>Columbus</i> thinking
it not worth his while to expect their return, seeing their barbarous Life,
burnt and destroy’d all their Boats, and spoiling whatever he could, sail’d to
<i>Matanino</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Women in <i>Matanino</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The releas’d Women in <i>Guadalupe</i>, that came back again, inform’d the <i>Spaniards</i>,
That <i>Matanino</i> was an Isle onely inhabited by Women, which at accustom’d
times row’d over to these <i>Cannibals</i>, where a while they drove a Trade and
Commerce of Love, the Product of which, if Girls, they kept; but the Boys
they sent over to their Fathers. They live in Caves, the Mouths and Entrances
of which they maintain and stoutly make good with their Bowe, shooting
Arrows as thick as Hail at the approach of Men, after their impregnating by
the <i>Cannibals</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable Passage of <i>Columbus</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Salvageness of the <i>Indians</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>From hence the Fleet pass’d by several other fruitful Islands, <i>Columbus</i> giving
them the Names of <i>Montseratto</i>, <i>Rodondo</i>, <i>St. Martin</i>, <i>Santa Cruz</i>, formerly by the
Inhabitants call’d <i>Ayaya</i>. On this last Island he landed thirty Men, who took
four Women, which held out their Hands before them, as if Petitioners that
begg’d Quarter, or praying, and then conceal’d themselves in Ambuscade, the
better to surprize more; when by chance they spied an <i>Indian</i> <i>Canoo</i> at Sea,
with eight Men, and as many Women; whereupon those in Ambuscade
made a Signal to the next Ship, which immediately sent off some Boats well
Mann’d; but before they drew near them, or expected an On-set, one of the
<i>Spaniards</i> was kill’d, and another wounded with their Arrows; amongst whom
a Woman, to whom all the rest shew’d greatest Respect and Reverence, aim’d
very exactly. Their barbed Shafts were poyson’d; whereupon the <i>Spaniards</i>
enrag’d, stemm’d the <i>Canoo</i>, and oversetting, row’d quite over; which little or
nothing avail’d; for they all swam, and though separated, shot their Arrows
at them, as if the Boat had been a But. At last the <i>Indians</i> got upon a blind
Rock, cover’d with Shole Water, which gave them fresh Courage; but the
<i>Spaniards</i> having more aid sent them from the Fleet, took them all Prisoners;
but the Queens Son being wounded in the Scuffle, and dying soon after, was
thrown overboard. The Prisoners being brought before <i>Columbus</i>, foam’d at
the Mouth for raging madness; and being afterwards carried to <i>Castile</i>, so retain’d
their fierce and salvage Nature, that they scar’d away and frighted the
safe Beholders.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mean while the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet proceeded on their Voyage, between several
Islands, to <i>Hispaniola</i>, of which some appear desolate and barren, others green
and Woody; the small Vessels sailing close under the Shore, and the great ones
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>standing further off at Sea, which was very turbulent, and beat exceedingly
against the Shole Rocks. The Island <i>Burichema</i>, <i>Columbus</i> call’d <i>St. Johns</i>, to
which belong’d some of the Women sent forth in <i>Guadalupe</i>, who inform’d
them, That <i>Burichema</i> was well inhabited by a kind and hospitable People,
who when the <i>Cannibals</i> landed there fought them, and if Conquerors, were
so much exasperated with their inhumane Barbarisms, that they seiz’d on them
like Mastiffs open-mouth’d, and tore them piece-meal with their Teeth; yet
themselves abhorring the Custom of eating Mens Flesh. Here the <i>Spaniards</i>
found onely a large House, surrounded with twelve lesser ones, all deserted;
for the Inhabitants with their King <i>Chiasichio</i> were then retir’d into the cool
and more sheltring Woods, from the mid-day Heat. All this the <i>Indians</i> told
him, which he brought back with him from <i>Spain</i>. Coming to an Anchor at
<i>Hispaniola</i>, he sent one of the <i>Indians</i> ashore, that he might tell what brave
things he had seen in the <i>Spanish</i> Court; but the remaining three took the advantage
of the following Night, and leaping over-board, swam to Shore. But
this Accident he not much regarded, trusting to have a sufficient Account from
his eight and thirty <i>Spaniards</i> which he had left in the Fort upon the Island;
and the more, because King <i>Guaccanarillo</i>’s brother, in sign of Friendship, had
presented him with two Golden Images: But all these Conjectures fail’d him,
so that hearing nothing, he landed, where he found the <i>Spanish</i> Garrison utterly
destroy’d, and the Royal Fort burnt down to the Ground, and lying in a heap
of Ashes. Then they fired several Guns, to give notice, that if any of them
had conceal’d themselves, and lay sculking in the Woods, or otherwise, they
should discover themselves, and come to the succour of their Friends: But all
in vain, for none came; for as they were afterwards inform’d, the Inhabitants
had slain them, because of their insupportable behavior, insolently committing
Robberies, Rapes, and Murders: Hereupon he sent Messengers to the
King <i>Guaccanarillo</i>, to inquire why they had fired his Fort, and what they had
done with his Men, who brought him this Return, That over that mighty
Island were many Princes, of which two being provok’d by the reports of the
Strangers that were entertain’d in the Island, came marching upon them, each
with their Armies; but that he endeavor’d what he could, and came with a
Power to assist the Strangers; yet all he got for his Kindness, was a Wound in
his Leg, which had been so sore and troublesom, that forc’d him to keep his
Bed, and no less than seven Concubines to attend him, and dress the Wound:
But he told his Tale so ill, and feign’d his Lameness worse, that <i>Sibilius</i>, one
of the Messengers sent by <i>Columbus</i>, lifting up the Coverlet, saw that he ail’d
nothing, which soon confirm’d his doubt, that he was confederated with the
rest, and alike guilty of the Slaughter. At last <i>Guaccanarillo</i> being desir’d, came
in Person to <i>Columbus</i>, in whose presence he held a long Discourse with an <i>Indian</i>
Woman, which they had brought from the Island of <i>Santa Cruz</i>, there
Christned by the Name of <i>Catharine</i>: At length <i>Guaccanarillo</i> was dismiss’d, and
the Night following this <i>Catharine</i>, with seven more of the <i>Indian</i> Women,
leap’d over-board, and swom almost a League to Shore, so going thence directly
to their King <i>Guaccanarillo</i>. This Accident gave more suspicion to <i>Columbus</i>,
who thereupon sent three hundred Men, commanded by <i>Melchior</i>, <i>Hoieda</i>,
and <i>Gorvalano</i>, to march through the Island three several ways, and with
special Commission to secure as their Prisoner <i>Guaccanarillo</i>. <i>Melchior</i> discover’d
a wide River, full of Reaches and winding Bays, gliding between high Hills
cover’d with Woods, resounding with the ecchoing noises of harmonious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Birds, and disemboguing his Waters, enlarg’d by two other Rivers, into the
Sea, so making a convenient Harbor for Ships. Here a hundred of the Islanders,
well Arm’d after their manner, met them, crying aloud, <i>We are no</i> Cannibals,
<i>but</i> Taynos, that is, <i>a People more civil than they are cruel</i>. The <i>Spaniards</i> making
Signs of Peace, the <i>Taynos</i> approach’d, and joyn’d their Forces in a friendly
manner. Near the place of this Meeting appear’d a House built in an Oval
fashion, being thirty two Paces in the Circumference, the Roof curiously
pleited of divers colour’d Rushes, round about which stood thirty lesser Dwellings.
Mean while, in his March <i>Hoieda</i> discover’d a River that descended
from a high Mountain, where the Inhabitants gather’d much Gold after this
manner: They dig a Hole about two Foot deep; then taking up their left
Hand full of Sand, with their right Hand they cull out the precious Ingots,
which little accounting of, as they gather’d, they dealt away to the <i>Spaniards</i>.
Most of the Pieces were as big as Pease, yet some so large, that they weigh’d
nine Ounces. <i>Peter Martyr</i>, Councellor to the Emperor <i>Charles</i>, tells us, That
he hath seen of them in the <i>Spanish</i> Court, that were brought over thither by
<i>Columbus</i>.  Moreover, <i>Hoieda</i> was inform’d here, That this Gold-River took
its Original in the Province belonging to <i>Cacicus Caunaboa</i>, signifying, <i>The King
of the Golden Palace</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Columbus</i> builds a City.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange fruitfulness there.</div>

<p class='c010'>Mean time <i>Columbus</i> selected a piece of Ground on a rising Hill, on the
North part of the Isle, where he intended to build a City, because close by
the Hill on one side rises a Mountain, pregnant with Stone and Chalk; on the
other, a Plain, so exceeding fruitful and pleasant, that the Sun scarce shines
upon a more delightful and fertile Soil, which they found afterwards by experience.
Here Melons are set and ripe in thirty six days; Corn, in two
Months; twice a Year the Trees and Plants bring forth their several Products;
the Vines come to maturity, and are loaden with Clusters of Grapes, in
two Years, and Sugar-Canes grow as thick as a Mans Arm in fifteen days. On
this pleasant Soil, accommodated with a convenient Haven, <i>Columbus</i> afterwards
built the City <i>Isabella</i>, fortified with Walls and Trenches against all Invasions,
over which he made his Brother <i>Bartholomew Columbus</i> first Governor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mean while the Admiral <i>Columbus</i> himself march’d up into the Countrey
with three hundred Men, in quest of the Gold Mines. Seventy two Leagues
the Valley <i>Cibava</i> lies distant from <i>Isabella</i>, to which <i>Columbus</i> pass’d over swift
Currents and high Mountains, where he built a Fort, which he call’d <i>St. Thomas</i>;
and exchang’d with the Inhabitants Toys and Trifles, for Pieces and Ingots
of Gold, which the Inhabitants, as before-mention’d, found in the Sand
of their Rivers: And besides, they inform’d him, That about half a days
Journey further, greater Quantities of Gold were to be found, in a browner
colour’d Soil: Whereupon <i>Luxanus</i>, one of his Officers, was sent with a sufficient
Party thither, who march’d through a delightful way, cool with shady
Boughs, and pleasant with the prospect of spacious Meadows, where they
mow’d Grass for their Horses, which in four days time grew up again higher
than our tallest Wheat.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Goes to Sea to discover new Countreys.</div>

<p class='c010'>Mean time <i>Columbus</i> being return’d with great Riches to his new City <i>Isabella</i>,
went soon after by Sea, with three Vessels, to discover new Countreys
more remote; which his Design fell out also successfully; for he fell first upon
<i>Jamaica</i>, where he found more stout Opposition than elsewhere, by the Natives,
at his Landing; but finding themselves over-power’d, they came to
Agreement, and accepting an amicable Composure, presently struck up a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Peace. From thence putting to Sea, he next discover’d <i>Cuba</i>, which sailing
round about, he found also to be an Island; where Landing in a convenient
Harbor, on each fenc’d with a high and jutting Rock, he espied two little Hovels,
wherein was abundance of Fish, besides two great Snakes or Serpents,
each having eight Feet, spitted, and ready to be laid to the Fire to be roasted;
but neither Man, Woman, nor Child to be seen, they being gone with part of
the Fish they had dress’d, into the adjacent Woods; whither the <i>Spaniards</i>
following, saw hanging by small Strings, on the Branches of Trees, abundance
of Snakes, some of which had their Mouths tied together, others their Tongue
and Teeth pull’d out. Hence marching on, a little beyond they saw a Company
of the Natives, which they judg’d to be about seventy Men, covering the
top or summit of a Hill, to whom the <i>Spaniards</i> made Signs, and to entice
them near, shew’d several of their gawdy Trifles; but in vain, till at last one
adventur’d, descending from the Hill, to whom one of the Natives (who in the
first Voyage that the Admiral made, was taken from the Island <i>Guanabaini</i> near
<i>Cuba</i>, carried to <i>Spain</i>, and there Christned) call’d aloud, telling him they need
not fear, they should have no harm done them; which said, they came down
all together, and inform’d them, That they were sent by their King to catch
Fish for another King, which was with him at Dinner; and if they had not
eaten the Serpents, they gave them many thanks; for they were provided for
the second Course, and very scarce to be got, being a greater Dainty than any
Fish.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Discovers not without great Accidents, several New Countreys.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Columbus</i> from hence proceeding on further Westward, discover’d a fruitful
Coast, verging the Mouth of a River, whose Water runs boyling hot into
the Sea. Somewhat further he saw very strange Fishes, especially the <i>Guaican</i>,
not unlike an Eel, but with an extraordinary great Head, over which hangs a
Skin like a Bag. This Fish is the Natives Fisher; for having a Line or handsom
Cord fastned about him, so soon as a Turtel, or any other of his Prey,
comes above Water, they give him Line; whereupon the <i>Guaican</i>, like an Arrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>out of a Bowe, shoots towards the other Fish, and then gathering the
Mouth of the Bag on his Head like a Purse-net holds them so fast, that he lets
not loose till hal’d up out of the Water.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here the <i>Spaniards</i> having Din’d on delicate Fish, went on still Westward,
and came to an uninhabited Isle, but well stor’d with Geese, Pelicans, and ugly
Dogs that could not bark. Here they came amongst so many Shoals, that the
Keels of their Ships raked upon the Ground almost forty Leagues together,
the Water thick and white like Milk. Lastly, they came again into deep Water,
and Landed at the Foot of a high Mountain, on the Island <i>Cuba</i>; where they
found two Springs of very sweet Water. A Musqueteer going into the Woods
whilst the rest fill’d their Vessels with Water and cut Wood, he spied a tall
Man in a Coat like a white Fryer’s Frock; behind whom came two more, and
soon after thirty more follow’d, all alike Habited: the Musqueteer running
away, they beckned him to stay, but he march’d off; and informing <i>Columbus</i>
of his Adventure, he sent a Party well Arm’d to see farther into the Countrey;
but they neither saw nor heard any Men, onely found on the other side of the
Wood a great Plain, but so overgrown with deep Grass, that it was impossible
to get through: The next day he sent out twenty five more, which found nothing
else than the Prints of the Steps of great Beasts and Lyons, and also
abundance of large Grapes, which hung on the Branches of Vines, clasping
about the Bodies of the great Trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hence <i>Columbus</i> again putting to Sea, and Sailing Westerly, found a Shore
overflow’d with Water, and abounding with Pearl-Mussles, and after that the
whole Countrey full of Mountains, whose tops smoaked. By this time the
Fleet was much damnified by the Shole-water; where, as we mention’d before,
they often struck, and their Keels rak’d upon the Ground; so that having
sprung several Leaks, and their Provisions growing mouldy with the Damp,
they were forc’d to return; and Tacking about they ran against Turtles, which
lay as thick in the Sea as if they had been sow’n.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Columbus</i> now on his return home, and Landing once more on <i>Cuba</i>, found
an antient Man stark naked, who speaking to him (<i>Didacus</i> interpreted, the
Language in some part agreeing with that of <i>Hispaniola</i>) to this effect:</p>

<p class='c010'><i>You have to all admiration come to see this Countrey from another World, my advice to
you is, That you hurt none; for the Souls of evil-doers go to dark places: But on the contrary,
they shall enjoy the heighth of all Pleasures that are Friends to Peace.</i></p>

<p class='c010'><i>Columbus</i> reply’d, <i>That he came a Scourge for the cruel Cannibals, but a Shield to
protect the quiet and well-meaning Indians</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Great disturbance in <i>Hispaniola</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>After this, returning to <i>Hispaniola</i>, much contrary to his expectation, he
found all things which he had setled there turn’d topsie-turvy: for first the
Governors at <i>Isabella</i> jangled, and were at private contentions amongst themselves,
and the <i>Benedictine</i> Monk <i>Boilus</i> and <i>Peter Margarites</i> were return’d to
<i>Spain</i>; there to make their complaints at Court: and besides, the <i>Spaniards</i> had
dealt very inhumanely with the Natives, by their frequent Rapes, Thefts, and
Murders; wherefore the <i>Indians</i>, not unjustly incens’d, destroy’d all the <i>Spaniards</i>
they found stragling in any part without the Lines of their Fortification.
<i>Caunaboa</i> also lay about the Fort <i>St. Thomas</i>, and closely besieged <i>Hoieda</i>; but
receiving intelligence of <i>Columbus</i>’s arrival, he broke up his Siege, and march’d
from thence, but soon after was taken Prisoner by the <i>Spaniards</i>. Mean while
upon Design (a Plot none of the wisest) the Natives of <i>Hispaniola</i> had neither
Till’d or Sow’d the Ground, or us’d Agriculture the year before, contriving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>by want of Provisions (not considering themselves) to starve out the <i>Spaniards</i>;
but the mischief fell upon the Contrivers: for so great a Famine hapned, that
spreading over the whole Countrey, in a few Moneths fifty thousand were
starv’d to death; but the <i>Spaniards</i> made a saving, though hard shift with their
own store, then, though too late, the Islanders repented of their folly, for they
saw the <i>Spaniards</i> making an advantage of their misery, not onely built more
Houses in their City <i>Isabella</i>, but prepar’d their Weather-beaten Vessels, with
which Sailing to the Gold Mountains of <i>Cipangi</i> on the Hill, whence sprung
several Fountains, they rais’d the Castle of the <i>Conception</i>. Great benefit they
reap’d by this Fort, to which they carry’d daily abundance of Amber, Brimstone,
mix’d Ore of Silver and Gold, and <i>Brazile</i>-wood, besides great store of
Gold: and they might have gotten ten times more, had they not been so much
inclin’d to slothfulness, and minding other vain pleasures: yet notwithstanding
all, the Fleet carry’d that year above one thousand two hundred pound
weight of Gold to <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Spaniards</i> tyrannise there.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the mean while the Natives complain’d to <i>Columbus</i> of the <i>Spanish</i> Soldiers,
which under pretence to seek for Gold, committed many insufferable Outrages;
therefore they desir’d that they might be retain’d in their Forts, and not
straggle so much abroad, and they would willingly bring them every three
Moneths a certain weight of Cotton, Amber, <i>Brazile</i>-wood, and Gold, more
than equivalent to what they snatch’d; but <i>Columbus</i> (whose Soldiers, notwithstanding
his severity, and using Martial Law upon some of them for
their Crimes, and proud with their success) yet prevail’d at last, that they
consented thereto; but the Inhabitants never perform’d their promise, who
being almost famish’d, had much to do to preserve themselves alive, spending
their time in picking Sallads.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Conquest.</div>

<p class='c010'>Whilst the Business remain’d in this ill posture, or rather confusion, <i>Cibanus</i>,
Brother to the imprison’d <i>Caunaboa</i>, rais’d an Army of five thousand Men:
the <i>Spaniards</i>, divided into five Companies, march’d to meet him; and their
Enemies being naked, and having no other Arms than Bowes, Arrows, and
Clubs, after some little resistance, were soon dissipated and put to flight, but
overtaken by the <i>Spanish</i> Horse, many of them were taken Prisoners, and others
forc’d to skulk and hide themselves on the tops of Mountains.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Horible Tempest.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>A remarkable passage concerning <i>Bartholomew Columbus</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Brave reception of a King in <i>Hispaniola</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Shortly after this Battel hapned a Huricane, mix’d with Thunder-claps,
renting great pieces from the Rocks, and the Wind blowing out of the East,
threw down Houses and Trees, some of which were carry’d a vast heighth into
the Air; three Ships that rode in the Harbor, broke their new Cables, and
split against the Rocks. The <i>Spaniards</i> expected nought else, but that with this
excessive Tempest the Day of Judgment was at hand. And on the other side,
the Islanders ascribed this raging of Heavens to the <i>Spaniards</i> wickedness. This
Storm past, and the Air setled, <i>Columbus</i> gave order for the building of two new
Ships there, with which in <i>March</i>, <i>Anno 1495.</i> he return’d to <i>Spain</i>; where in
<i>Medina del Campo</i> he gave an account at the Court about the discover’d Countreys;
where also Sentence was pass’d on several <i>Spaniards</i>, and chiefly concerning
the <i>Benedictine</i> Monk <i>Boilus</i>, who out of meer malice pass’d by him at
Mass with the Host, while he gave it to others, without any distinction.
Then he gave a further account, that his Brother <i>Bartholomew</i> had found, sixty
Leagues beyond <i>Isabella</i>, several deep Pits, the uppermost Ground of which
Sifted, produced abundance of Gold. Moreover, that he had built the Castle
<i>Aurea</i> there in three Moneths time with little trouble: but because Provisions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>grew scarce there, he found himself necessitated to remove, but left ten Men in
the Garrison, and had sent three hundred of the Islanders with their Governors
to <i>Spain</i>. He also built the Castle <i>Dominico</i>, on the South-side of <i>Hispaniola</i>;
from whence he had travell’d into the Countrey to the River <i>Naiba</i>: where,
upon this Shore the King <i>Beuchio Anacauchoa</i> Encamp’d himself against the <i>Naibans</i>,
to bring them, besides several other People, under his subjection. That
<i>Bartholomew</i> demanded Tribute of <i>Anacauchoa</i>, which he immediately promis’d
to pay, and disbanded his Forces, conducting <i>Bartholomew</i> above thirty Leagues
on his Way, along a Path on both sides sown with Hemp, and planted with
Cotton-Trees, to his Palace <i>Xaraqua</i>, in the West of <i>Hispaniola</i>, where he was
received in great state: Thirty of the Kings Wives walk’d before, carrying in
their Hands Boughs of Palm-trees, and both Sung and Danc’d very strangely;
behind these came a considerable number of naked Virgins, very handsom; at
last <i>Bartholomew</i> entring the Palace with the King, found a Table furnish’d with
all manner of Dainties, and a very courteous Entertainment. The next day
walking forth to a large Plain, and looking about he saw two Parties that deeply
engag’d in Fight behind a Hill, with great slaughter on both sides, and had
not he desir’d that they might be parted, there had been much more Blood shed.
After he had been several days friendly entertain’d, he return’d to the Forts
<i>Isabella</i>, <i>Sperancia</i>, <i>Catharina</i>, <i>St. Jago</i>, <i>Turrita</i>, <i>Conception</i>, and <i>Dominico</i>; where he
found above three hundred <i>Spaniards</i> starv’d of hunger, besides many that were
sick.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the City <i>Angra</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Whilst all things were thus in disorder at <i>Hispaniola</i>, the Admiral <i>Christopher
Columbus</i> set Sail a third time with eight Ships from the Haven <i>Barrameda</i>, in
the Year 1498. To shun the <i>French</i> Pyrates, which watched for the <i>Indian</i>
Treasures, he directed his Course to <i>Madera</i>, a fruitful Island of Corn, Wine,
Sugar, Wax, and Cattel, desolate till <i>Anno 1420.</i> Here coming to an Anchor,
he sent six Ships away to <i>Hispaniola</i>, which himself afterwards followed with
the remaining two, steering by the <i>Flemish</i> Islands, or <i>Acores</i>, first so call’d
from the <i>Flemings</i>, the first Planters: Here he dropt Anchor before the City
<i>Angra</i> on the Isle <i>Tercera</i>, which is sixteen Leagues in circumference, and very
Mountainous; the tops whereof are like Spires, and abound with Grapes: the
Plain Countrey produces great store of Corn, but it will not keep above twelve
Moneths. The Ground is oftentimes terribly shaken by Earthquakes, and
between several sulphurous Places, both Flames and Smoak ascend up to the
Sky. Near the City <i>Angra</i> is a Fountain which turns Wood into Stone. The
Winds in this Place blow so fierce and strong, that they not onely beat down
Houses, but wear out Iron, and all manner of Stone-work. In <i>Angra</i> the chief
Commander of all the <i>Flemish</i> Isles hath his Residence. The City, surrounded
by steep Rocks, lies towards the Sea like a Crescent, or Half-Moon; for
at both ends thereof the Mountains extend with deep Points into the
Ocean. The uppermost part towards the West stands likewise fortifi’d by
a high Rock, as also by another on the East: on both are continual Watches
kept; whereof those on the first can discover Ships fifteen Leagues off at
Sea, coming either from the <i>East</i> or <i>West-Indies</i>; and on the other, all those that
come from <i>Europe</i>: When they see above fifteen Sail, they put out the Kings
great Flag upon the top of all the Rock.</p>

<p class='c010'>This City of <i>Angra</i> is divided into several Streets: the Governor and Archbishop
live each in a stately Palace; five handsom Churches are no small ornament
to it; the Sea before it abounds with Fish, but are not to be taken in
<i>December</i>, by reason of the turbulent Waves.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Christopher Columbus</i> having refresh’d at <i>Angra</i>, Sail’d along the <i>African</i> Coast
between the <i>Hesperides</i>: under the Equinoctial he was so miserably tormented
by the Heat, that his Vessels seem’d to burn, the Hoops sprung from the
Casks, so that the Water run about the Hold; and they could expect nothing
but death from the insufferable Heat, and want of Water: eight days they
had endur’d this hardship, when they met with a fresh Gale out of the South-East,
so that they made great Way towards the West. On the last of <i>July</i> he discover’d
three high Mountains; and approaching near the Shore, he smelt as in
a Posie, all the sweet breathings of fragrant Flowers commix’d, and at last saw
a convenient Haven; where going ashore he found cultivated Grounds, and
steps of Beasts, but not a Man appear’d: the next day they spy’d a Boat with
twenty young Men come rowing from the Shore into the Ocean. The Admiral
hal’d them in vain to come aboard, for they made the greater hast ashore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>still looking about continually with great admiration on the Ships: whereupon
he commanded them to beat their Drums, and sound their Trumpets, that
they might by that means entice them aboard; but they rather taking it as a
sign of War, made themselves ready for resistance: mean while the <i>Spaniards</i>
overtook the <i>Indian</i> Boat, into which they threw a Hat, and other trifles; the
Islanders amaz’d thereat, made signs to them to row ashore; but soon after
they fled.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Abundance of Pearl.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Columbus</i> proceeding on his Journey came to <i>Paria</i>, where he found a Fishers
Pink loaden with Oysters; which opening and taking out the Meat, were
found full of Pearls, which because of their abundance were not regarded
there; for a broken Dish and a rusty Knife, the <i>Spaniards</i> had four long Strings
of Pearl.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Columbus</i> is in great danger.</div>

<p class='c010'>From thence anchoring in the River of <i>Cumana</i>, several naked Men came
aboard, adorn’d with Golden Armlets, and Strings of Pearl, These inform’d
him, that they gather’d their Gold from the Mountains and Rivers, and caught
their Pearl-oysters in the adjacent Seas. Some of the <i>Spaniards</i> were nobly
entertain’d by the King and his Son, who leading them into their Palace, placed
them on Benches of Ebony-wood, curiously wrought, and on a sudden several
Servants came in with variety of Dainties, and well-tasted Wine. But
because Provisions grew scarce amongst the Sea-men, and their Meat tainted,
<i>Columbus</i> thought it convenient to leave the Pearl-trade till some better opportunity.
Then setting forward, the farther he went, the shallower he found the Sea,
insomuch that his Ship scarce had Water enough to swim. This inconvenience
was followed by a second; for the Sea being full of Weeds and Grass, scarce
suffer’d any Passage. A River thirty Yards deep, and twenty Leagues broad,
came rushing out betwixt two Shores into this Sea with such force, that the
Waves went high like Mountains, which made <i>Columbus</i> judge himself in the
greatest danger imaginable, and withall Tack about; so that he came on the
eight and twentieth of <i>August Anno 1498.</i> to an Anchor before <i>Hispaniola</i>, where
all things were still in a sad confusion, as we before related.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Roldanus Ximenes</i> opposes <i>Columbus</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange <i>Indians</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Roldanus Ximenes</i> refus’d to follow <i>Christopher Columbus</i>’s, order and writ Letters
to the King of <i>Spain</i>, in which he exceedingly aspersed both the Admiral <i>Columbus</i>
and his Brother; who were not backward in giving an account quite
contrary by their Letters, of the horrid Villanies perpetrated by this <i>Ximenes</i>,
and desir’d aid, that so great an Offender might receive condign punishment.
Mean while the <i>Ciquano</i>’s came marching down with six thousand Men, which
<i>Bartholomew</i> went to meet with eighty Foot and some few Horse: The <i>Indians</i>
which he was to encounter with, rather seeming like Furies than Men, for all
of them were daub’d over with black smuts on their bare Skins from Head to
Foot, and their hard Hair pleited in terrible, not in Lovelocks, hung playing,
or dangling over their Shoulders. When the <i>Spaniards</i> in their March drawing
up to a River where it was best fordable, had no sooner left the Bank, and
taken the Water, endeavoring to wade over, but the Salvages rush’d forth out
of the Woods, and let flye a showre of Arrows, that had they not been provided
with Shields and Targets, to keep off such a deadly Storm, so thick they
flew, and so well aim’d, most of them had perish’d there: but having recover’d
the opposite Bank, the Enemy play’d all hid, and in a thought shelter’d
themselves under the protection of the Woods; where the Conqueror
pursuing, found the Service very difficult and dangerous, for their Armes, especially
their Shields, stopping and intangling them as in a Net, among the shrubby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>and twining Branches; which they passing, rigled themselves, and made
their way, like questing Spaniels following their Game, and still gawling them
with their Arrows: whereupon they left their vain pursuit, marching another
way to intercept <i>Mayobanexius</i>, who with eight thousand <i>Ciquano</i>’s were then
coming down against them; which prov’d a harder task than was expected:
for e’re he could reduce him and his stubborn Party, he spent three Moneths in
the Service.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>But the great and worthy Service of these two excellent Brothers deserving
rather Statues and Trophies of everlasting Honor, Monuments never to be
demolish’d, in their due praise, who had found out after so many baffled Ages,
a new World, richer, and not much less than the old, by the aspersing calumniations
of one malicious Person, lost his whole Interest and Credit in the
<i>Spanish</i> Court, quite out of favour with his Prince, who by his insinuations
had hinted so much the matter of Gain among the Courtiers, that every one
studied no less than to get a Commission, and so going a Commander to the
<i>Indies</i>, make up his Mouth, and become suddenly rich. First <i>Francisco Bombadilla</i>
prevailing, was sent with full Commission to succeed <i>Columbus</i> in <i>Hispaniola</i>;
where no sooner Landing, but he exercis’d the extremity of his Authority, and
seizing the Admiral and his Brother, fetter’d their Hands and Feet, and put them
aboard on two several Ships for <i>Spain</i>: where no sooner arriv’d, but the King,
not altogether forgetting former Services, commanded them to be unmanacled,
and waited on, not as Prisoners, with a civil Retinue to his Court;
where they were well entertain’d three years. But they being active Persons,
weary of so long repose, got a second Grant to make farther discoveries, and
set forth the ninth of <i>May, Anno 1504.</i> with four Sail well appointed from
<i>Cadiz</i>, and had a fair Passage from thence to <i>Hispaniola</i>, where begun the Storm,
for <i>Bombadilla</i>, who had by the Kings Commission so evil treated <i>Columbus</i> and
his Brother, as aforemention’d, would not suffer him, though reconciled to
the King, so much as to Land, and there refresh themselves and their Men; so
he was forc’d to steer on to the Islands <i>Guamixa</i> and <i>Veragua</i>, where a Huricane,
or sudden stress of Weather sunk two of his Vessels; the other two standing
off to Sea escap’d bilging, but so shatter’d and leaky, having also shipp’d
abundance of Water, they were resolv’d to put in at <i>Jamaica</i>; where weary
with the long Voyage, and hatter’d with the Tempest, many of his Sea-men,
spent with sickness, after their Landing, died. To these his sufferings from
Wind and Weather, and his Enemies abroad, a greater and intestine mischief
hapned: <i>Francisco Poresio</i>, one of his chief Commanders, absolutely rebell’d,
and deserting him, with another Party of his Sea-men went into <i>Hispaniola</i>:
which the Islanders observing, resolv’d to famish him, keeping from him both
Water and all other Provisions; which had not <i>Columbus</i> stav’d off by a handsom
Invention, they had compleated their Design, which was this: He told
them that he was the offspring of the Moon, and if they refus’d to supply
his want, the Moon, in vindication of her Son, would famish them, by spoiling
what e’re they had planted or sow’d; and that this would prove true they
should know by a sign, that on such a Night, she rising in her full glory, should
first look red, and afterwards by degrees lose a great part of her light; which
indeed so hapned, being Ecclips’d, as he could well prognosticate; and after
that, they being ignorant of the cause, suppli’d him with all Necessaries.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>But <i>Poresio</i>, not able to endure the Sea with his small Boats, resolv’d to surprize
one of the Ships that lay before <i>Jamaica</i>; but <i>Columbus</i> so much prevented
him, that meeting him in his return, after a hot dispute made him his Prisoner.
But thus ended not his misfortunes; for the Vessels which he fought in soon
after sunk, and no ship to be found in <i>Jamaica</i> to transport him thence. Lastly,
he agreed with some <i>Indian</i> Fishermen, to carry <i>Didaco Mendoza</i> to <i>St. Dominica</i>,
that there he might hire two Vessels to carry him back to <i>Spain</i>: which Design
taking effect, he arrived there in safety: where after he had refresh’d himself
at the <i>Spanish</i> Court, after his so long and unfortunate a Voyage he fell
sick, and died on the eighth of <i>May</i> 1506.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mean while, the Affairs of <i>Hispaniola</i> grew more out of order: for <i>Bombadilla</i>
joyning with <i>Ximenes</i>, resolv’d to hoard up a huge Treasure of Gold,
though with the infinite oppression of the Natives: of which King <i>Ferdinand</i>
having intelligence, sent <i>Nicholas Olanda</i> thither with thirty Sail; who being
nominated Vice-Roy, anchor’d in forty days before <i>Hispaniola</i>. No sooner
arriv’d, but <i>Bombadilla</i> and <i>Ximenes</i> fled, leaving their vast Treasure, amounting
to ten hundred thousand Ducats; which guarded with four hundred <i>Spaniards</i>
in twenty four Ships was sent to <i>Spain</i>: but so it hapned, that they were
all swallowed up in the main Ocean, none knowing to this day in what Latitude
they were lost.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of <i>Curiana</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Pietro Nigno</i>, encourag’d by some of those that had been with <i>Columbus</i> at the
Isles of Pearl, Rigg’d out a Ship at his own charge, with special order in his
Commission, that he should not touch on any Coast within fifty Leagues of
any Place <i>Columbus</i> had formerly discover’d. But he little observ’d his Orders,
and what he was commanded; for Sailing into the Haven <i>Curiana</i>, he barter’d
Shells, Needles, Glass, and such like Trifles, for abundance of Pearls, which the
Islanders brought aboard, for he himself having but thirty Men, durst not venture
ashore. Twenty days this bartering Trade continued, Orient Pearls for
Toys; but finding at last, that they were a civil and hospitable People, he
Landed, where they entertain’d him in Hovels built of Wood, and cover’d
with Palm-Leaves; before their Doors lay great Hills of Oyster-shells, the
Fish being eaten, and the Pearls us’d for an ornament; Conies, Hares, Pheasants,
Pigeons, Geese, Ducks, Deer, and wild Swine, are their usual Food;
and their Bread is made of the Roots of Trees. Moreover, <i>Curiana</i> abounds with
thick and shady Woods, which resound in the night with the cries and roarings
of wild Beasts: but though they are terrible fierce and voracious, yet the
Natives stoutly venture in amongst the thickest of them, arm’d onely with
Bowes and Arrows. The Inhabitants are of Complexion tawny, their Hair
long and curl’d; their Teeth they keep white with an Herb, which they continually
hold betwixt their Lips. The Women perform their business of
Husbandry, Ploughing and Sowing. The Men are Soldiers, following the
business of War: but in Peace their Exercises are Hunting and Dancing.
They keep annual Fairs, where from all Parts of the Countrey they bring their
Commodities to buy and barter. They have their Gold from <i>Cauchieta</i>, six
days Sail Westward from <i>Curiana</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Thither <i>Nigno</i> next directed his course, and came to an Anchor there on
the first of <i>October, Anno 1500.</i> The Inhabitants entred aboard without the least
shiness, or fear of danger, and brought with them to barter, Gold, Civet-Cats,
Parrots, and Cotton.</p>

<p class='c010'>These People, though so civil, are extreamly jealous of their Wives: for
when a <i>Spaniard</i> made address to one of them, and coming something close,
her Husband stept in suddenly between, and seem’d to forbid the Banns. But
coasting onward along the Shore from thence to another Isle, he found Natives
far more wild and salvage: for two thousand in a Body well Arm’d,
stood ready to intercept their Landing; wherefore he thought it his safest
course to Tack about, and return to <i>Curiana</i> whence he came.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Nigno</i> Fights with the Cannibals.</div>

<p class='c010'>In his Way not far from thence, he fell amongst eighteen of the Cannibals
Boats, which according to their custom had been a Man-stealing, and now
were so hardy, that setting upon the <i>Spanish</i> Ship, they suddenly clapt him
aboard with their <i>Canoos</i> on all sides; but being beaten back by the terror of
their Guns, they soon retir’d: yet the <i>Spaniards</i> took one of the Boats with
two Men, all the rest saving themselves by swimming. One of the two Men
lay bound Hand and Foot, who told them, that he was to have been kill’d the
next day and eaten, as he saw his Companions, with whose Flesh they banquetting
kept a jovial Feast. <i>Nigno</i> unbinding the Prisoner, gave him leave
to do what he pleas’d with the taken Cannibal, who falling upon him, cudgel’d
and whipp’d him to death.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Salt.</div>

<p class='c010'>Then <i>Nigno</i> in his Way to <i>Curiana</i> touch’d upon the Coast of <i>Paria</i>, where
he found a strange kind of Salt, which the Sea in tempestuous Weather casts on
the Shore, which afterwards hardens by the Sun. This Salt must be taken up
before any Rain fall, else it melts and soaks away into the Ground; yet sometimes
grows so hard as a Stone, insomuch that they make Pots and other Vessels
of it; which the <i>Parians</i> barter for foreign Commodities.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Corps.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Nigno</i> not making here any stay, return’d a second time to <i>Curiana</i>, where
he spent twenty days in pleasant Pastimes, being Lodg’d in a Noble-mans
House, at whose Door was fix’d a Cannibals Head, as a Trophy of his Victory.
He saw there also the dead Bodies of divers eminent Persons set drying
at a Fire, so hardned to be set amongst their Idols.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Nigno</i> put in Prison.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Cruel dealings in <i>Curiana</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>At length <i>Nigno</i> set Sail homewards, and carried with him an invaluable
Treasure in Pearls to <i>Spain</i>: but by the way fell out with his Sea-men,
because he kept most of the Purchase to himself, and would not give them
their shares, nay more than that, kept back the fifth part from the King;
whereupon being complain’d of by <i>Ferdinando de Vega</i>, Governor of <i>Gallicia</i>,
he was put in Prison, and at last sent to the Court, where the Pearls were
declared free Prize, because <i>Nigno</i> had barter’d for them at <i>Curiana</i>, contrary
to the Kings Orders, not to touch at any Coast, within fifty Leagues of what
<i>Columbus</i> had discover’d. But since he had no way regarded those Commands
to preserve that Pearl-Trade, King <i>Ferdinand</i> sent Governors to <i>Curiana</i>, who
in his Name should look after, and employ Men for the catching the Pearl-Oysters.
These, accompanied with a considerable number of Soldiers, besides
six Monks, forc’d the Inhabitants to furnish them with abundance of Pearl:
which oppression grew to such a heighth, that one Morning a great Party of
them conspiring together, fell suddenly upon them, most of them being massacred:
after they had a while insultingly triumphed over the dead Bodies, and
finish’d, as they thought, their good work (feasting on their Flesh at a joyful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Banquet) those few that escap’d Sail’d to the Island <i>Dominic</i>, the Governor
of which <i>Didacus Columbus</i>, Son to the famous <i>Christopher</i>, being incens’d,
immediately sent Captain <i>Ocampo</i> with three hundred Men to <i>Curiana</i>; where
in his first fury, without distinction of Sex or Age, he slew all he met with.
But because they themselves could not follow the rich Oyster-catching, he
spar’d some for that purpose, whom he commanded to build twenty five little
Houses, or Hovels, on the Shore, which he call’d <i>New Toledo</i>. After this they
went on afresh in their Pearl-fishing.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>The first of <i>December, Anno 1499.</i> <i>Vincent Pinzon</i> set Sail with four Vessels
out of the Haven <i>Palos</i>: he had been Commander of a Ship under
<i>Columbus</i> in his first Expedition, by which means he got great experience in
Navigation. When he came a little beyond the <i>Hesperides</i>, he was surpris’d by
a great Storm, which in three days drove him before a plain Coast; where
Landing, he found nothing but the Footsteps of Men; and in the night he
saw great Fires, such as are generally made in Camps; about day-break twenty
<i>Spaniards</i> march’d thither, whom thirty two Men, arm’d with Bowes and
Arrows, made ready to encounter; but as they approached, the <i>Spaniards</i> proffer’d
them Peace, but they refused all Composition; yet having faced one another
a while, they retreated without fighting.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Pinzon</i>’s strange Fight.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>A remarkable Beast.</div>

<p class='c010'>After this <i>Pinzon</i> discover’d a wide, but shallow River; where Landing, on
a Hill he met a great company of <i>Americans</i>: He, to invite them to Trade,
threw them a Shell; in return for which they cast him a lump of Gold; which
when the <i>Spaniard</i> went to take up they all fell upon him; and indeed he
could not have defended himself long, had not some of his Company quickly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>come in to his speedy rescue, which occasion’d a bloody Conflict, wherein several
<i>Spaniards</i> were wounded, eight kill’d, and one of their small Boats sunk; for
the <i>Americans</i> fought so valiantly, that they pursu’d the <i>Spanish</i> Ships into the Sea.
<i>Pinzon</i> being at last freed of these Assailants, got into a fresh-water Sea, caus’d
by the confluence of many Rivers falling in there: from hence he got sight of
the <i>Parian</i> Coast, and with admiration beheld a Tree which sixteen Men could
not compass: Between these Trees he saw as strange a Monster, the foremost
part resembling a Fox, the hinder a Monkey, the Feet were like a Mans, with
Ears like an Owl; under whose Belly hung a great Bag, in which it carry’d the
Young, which they drop not, nor forsake till they can feed themselves. <i>Pinzon</i>
caught one of them with three Young, which died in the Voyage, but the
Dam he presented alive in <i>Granada</i> to the King.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Great Storm.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Captain having Sail’d six hundred Leagues along the <i>Parian</i> Coast,
in a great Tempest two of his Carvils in his view were overset, their Keels
turn’d upward; the third driven from her Anchor, and the fourth so shaken,
and full of Leaks, that ready to sink they ran her ashore to save their lives; and
though he escaped himself the danger of drowning, then being ashore, yet he
was no ways freed from far greater inconveniences; for he saw nothing but
death either for want of Provisions, or barbarousness of the Inhabitants:
whereupon they resolv’d to free themselves of their miseries by self-slaughter,
killing one another; but some better advised to spend their Lives like <i>Christians</i>
upon the unbelieving Salvages: Whilst they were in this desperate condition,
the Storm ceased, and Providence presented their safety, the Ship driving
in before the Wind; at which every one taking fresh courage, they mended
the two shatter’d Ships as well as they could; wherein venturing to Sea, and
setting Sail, they came on the last of <i>September, Anno 1500.</i> into the <i>Spanish</i>

the <i>Europeans</i> in Running and Swimming, insomuch that the Women oftentimes
without any Boats, or floating pieces of Timber, venture two or
three Leagues into the Sea; they have so great skill in Shooting, that they
exceed almost all other Nations, having Arrows headed with sharp Fish-bones;
they also use Lances and Clubs. The Women follow the Men in the
Wars, and serve in stead of Horses to carry Ammunition and other Necessaries;
to which Labor they are so us’d, that they will bear on their Shoulders
forty, nay fifty Leagues together, such Luggage, as three <i>Spaniards</i> are scarce
able to lift from the Ground. They acknowledge no Commander or Superior
either in Wars or Government; they keep up old Feuds, fighting with an
inveterate hatred against their Neighbors, upon antient scores and revenges,
still kept in memory of their Relations slain in former Battels, and also still
creating fresh animosities upon their Losses in later Engagements. Their
Language is smooth and pleasing, being spoken with a kind of lisping, and
absolutely different from the neighboring Nations. When they eat they sit
upon the Ground, and sleeping lie in Hammocks, each end whereof being fastned
to a Post; underneath they kindle a Fire; over them they hang Fish-nets
and Hooks, Fish-baskets and <i>Calabashes</i>. When they have occasion to ease Nature
by evacuation, they retire into some private Place; but the Women think
it no immodesty to make Water, even in the presence of strange Men. They
observe not single Matrimony; for every Man takes as many Women as he
pleases, under bonds of Wedlock such and so sleight, that he turns them off at
his pleasure: and Women take the same liberty in casheering their Husbands
when not pleasing them. They bring forth Children with little or no pain,
and wash them in a River so soon as born; which done they return to their
usual work and business. When they are incens’d against their Husbands, they
revenge themselves by poysoning their Children. Their Houses are built in
the fashion of a House-clock, with a Roof rais’d from the Wall upon four Pillars
like the Bell, and cover’d with Palm-Leaves; some of which are so big,
that they afford room for six hundred Men: every seventh or eighth year they
remove, because (as they say) the Air is oftentimes infected by Mens Breaths,
by their long continuance in one place. Their Riches consist in Feathers of
divers colours, Strings of Fish-bones intermingled with green and white
Beads, with which they adorn their Heads, Arms, Legs, Ears, and Cheeks:
Gold and Pearls they make little account of; and as to Trade and Commerce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>with other People, they know not what belongs to it. Their greatest Friendship
consists in prostituting their Daughters or Wives to one another. Their
Dead they bury in moist Grounds, and put with them both Meat and Drink
into the Graves: When any Person grows very weak by lingring Sickness,
they carry the Diseased into a neighboring Wood, where they lay him in a Silk
Hammock, tied between two Trees; then dancing the whole day about him,
at night they set Bread and Water enough by him to last four days, and then departing
look no more after him, who thus neglected seldom escape: but if so
it happen that one recover, all his Relations for the future honour him as a
god. When any one falls into a Fever, his Friends immediately bathe him in
cold Water, and afterwards set him before a great Fire, then drive him before
them till he falls down almost breathless, and at last put him to Bed. They
neither Let blood in the Arms nor Feet, but in their Sides and Calves of their
Legs. Sometime they fast four days together, which they suppose a great
means to preserve their Health. Their Bread consists of a sort of Fruit call’d
<i>Jucha</i>, <i>Chambi</i>, or <i>Igname</i>. Lastly, no Lyon devours his Prey with more voracious
eagerness, than they their taken Enemies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A very strange Village built on Poles.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Fight.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Vesputius</i> being fully inform’d concerning the Situation of <i>Paria</i>, weighed
Anchor, and on the sixth day after entred a convenient Harbor, where going
ashore, he found twenty Houses built in the middle of a Lake on great Posts:
every House had a Draw-bridge, over which they pass’d from one to the other.
So soon as the Inhabitants set eye on the <i>Spaniards</i>, they immediately drew up
their Bridges: yet some of them in twelve little <i>Canoos</i> came towards the <i>Spanish</i>
Ships, but amaz’d to see their Looms so big, durst not, though hal’d with
signs, to come aboard, but hasted away to a high Mountain; yet seem’d to signifie
that they would return, as indeed they did, bringing sixteen Maids along
with them, of which they put four into a <i>Spanish</i> Boat, themselves in the interim
rowing between the Ships from one to another, shewing all tokens of
friendship, when on a sudden a Company of old Women came running to the
Shore, and tearing the Hair from their Heads, made a terrible noise and exclamation,
expressing the greatest sorrow they could possible: whereupon the
four <i>Indian</i> Maids suddenly leap’d over-board, and the Men shot abundance of
Arrows out of their Boats at the Ships; nay, some of them swimming under
Water, endeavor’d to sink the Cock-boats which were made fast behind their
Ships. Upon this sudden Onset the <i>Spaniards</i> making use of their Guns, quickly
lessen’d the number of the Assailants, insomuch that they fled to the Shore;
yet five of them being overtaken, were carry’d Prisoners aboard.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Vesputius</i> observing these their misdemeaning Carriages, judg’d it no way
convenient to stay any longer among such barbarous and deceitful Salvages:
but having weighed Anchor, and Sail’d eighty Leagues along the Coast, he
ran into another convenient Haven, whose Shore swarm’d with People, which
on a sudden running away, hid themselves in a neighboring Wood.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Serpents strangely prepar’d for Food.</div>

<p class='c010'>Here the <i>Spaniards</i> Landing were amazed, when in their Huts they saw
Snakes and Serpents roasting before a Fire, whereof one had Wings, and another
whose Mouth was tied together with a Rope, stared with open eyes in a
frightful manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here they left several Trifles to entice the fled Natives to correspond with
them. And this their Design prov’d successful; for the next day the <i>Americans</i>
came aboard without the least fear, and offer’d to shew their hospitable kindness
to the <i>Spaniards</i>, if they pleas’d to travel three days Journey with them up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>into the Countrey, telling them, they had onely rais’d those few Huts by the
Sea-side for a small time whilst they Fish’d in those Parts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The remarkable reception of twenty three <i>Spaniards</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>About twenty of the <i>Spaniards</i> well Arm’d resolv’d to undertake the Journey;
and travelling over Hills, Dales, and Rivers, they came at last into a
Village consisting of nine of the foremention’d Houses, but mightily peopled,
where they were in a wonderful manner received by their glad welcomes, by
Dancing, Singing, Hunting, and other joyful Acclamations, presenting their
Wives and Daughters, as the chiefest part of their hospitality, to caress the
Strangers at their pleasure. The news was no sooner spread, but the adjacent
Villages came in throngs to gaze upon, and salute the Strangers, inviting them
also to their Towns. The <i>Spaniards</i> taking it in good part, spent nine days
among them, highly treated with all manner of jollities, but especially at their
choice with the varieties of <i>Venus</i>: from thence then returning to their Fleet,
accompanied with thousands of the Natives, every one carrying Presents to the
Admiral <i>Vesputius</i>; of whom as many as they could at once receive, they entertaining
aboard, then dismiss’d them, and admitted others; but the Guns going
off, they suddenly leap’d from the Decks, and div’d like Ducks under Water:
But afterwards being inform’d, that such thunder-claps were sent them from
Heaven to destroy their Enemies, they were somewhat better satisfi’d, and
call’d the <i>Spaniards</i>, <i>Charabi</i>, that is, <i>Wise Men</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A cruel Fight with the Cannibals.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Island lying in the <i>Mexican</i> Bay, in twenty Degrees of Northern Latitude,
<i>Vesputius</i> left on his Starboard, and Sail’d along a Meandring Coast
(which he always kept in sight) eight hundred and sixty Leagues, and at last
entred a Haven, the like whereof he had not seen before. Here he spent a
Moneth in repairing his Ships, to which the Inhabitants freely gave their assistance;
and among other things complain’d, that a salvage People came yearly
thither from an Island about a hundred Leagues distant, who fell upon them
with horrible rage, and whomsoever they took they eat, but first inflicted all
manner of tortures upon them, sparing none, but together murthering aged
People and sucking Infants; wherefore they crav’d assistance to be reveng’d,
which if the <i>Spaniards</i> would grant, they would follow the Fleet with their
Boats. <i>Vesputius</i> promis’d his aid to destroy such a blood-thirsty People; and
to assure them that he would perform his Word, he order’d seven of them to
go in <i>Canoos</i> before and shew them the Way. On the seventh day they came
to an Anchor before the Island <i>Hy</i>, where the Shore was guarded with naked
Men, whose Bodies being strong and brawny, were painted, and their Arms,
Legs, and Head, adorn’d with divers colour’d Plumes, having not onely offensive
Weapons, as Bowes, Arrows, and Launces, but also defensive, huge Targets,
and square Shields. So soon as they judg’d the approaching <i>Spaniards</i> to
be within reach, they shot a great flight of Arrows at them; but <i>Vesputius</i> lying
close along the Shore with his Ships, fir’d upon them with Chain-shot, which
did great execution: yet notwithstanding about forty <i>Spaniards</i> leaping ashore
out of their Boats, found themselves in no small danger; for the Cannibals
upon the sound of Horns flocking together, so press’d upon them that they
were forc’d to lay aside their Guns, and fall to Blows, and had not timely assistance
come to them, they had undoubtedly been all slain: two hours the
Victory was doubtful on whose side it would fall; yet at last the Cannibals
quitting the Field, left the <i>Spaniards</i> Victors; who the next day pursu’d their
gotten Victory with such success, that they drove their Enemies before them,
burnt their Villages and Boats, and carry’d two hundred and two and twenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>of them Prisoners to <i>Spain</i>, where they safely arriv’d the 15. of <i>November, Anno
1498.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Vesputius</i> Second Expedition.</div>

<p class='c010'>This good success so encourag’d <i>Vesputius</i>, that having stay’d scarce seven
Moneths ashore, he obtaining the Command over six Ships, with which he
set Sail from <i>Cadiz</i>, and touching upon the <i>Canaries</i>, Steer’d from thence
Southerly; and having Sail’d five hundred Leagues, he discover’d a Countrey
overflow’d and made Marishy by great Rivers, and abounding with Trees, but
saw no sign of any Inhabitants; yet not long after, coming before an Island, he
took a Boat with two Prisoners, newly guelt, and sent as a Present to feast
the <i>Cannibals</i>, which refus’d to Treat on any other account whatsoever; wherefore
he Sail’d eighty Leagues forward along the Shore of an unknown Island,
where he Barter’d for some Gold, and got five hundred Pearls for one single
Shell; these Pearls the Inhabitants said were not found there, but taken from
their Neighboring Enemies, which liv’d Westward, and had abundance of
them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange constitution of a salvage people.</div>

<p class='c010'>Nothing worthy of remark happen’d in this Voyage, onely the strange constitutions
of a wild People, living on a barren Isle, deserve to be mention’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>About their Necks hung two hollow Vessels, the one full of white stamp’d
Worts, and Herbs; and the other, full of Grass, which they greedily cram’d
into their Mouths, feeding like Cattel; then a Stick wetted with Spittle, they
put into the bruis’d Herbs, taking upon the end of it, as upon the point of a
Knife, some of the bruis’d to their Mouths, which (as if chawing the Cud) turning
therein, then taking out again, and strowing more of the same Herbs out of
the Vessel upon it, swallow’d it down. No fresh Water was to be had amongst
them, but what they gather’d from the Dew in great Leaves: Neither had
they any Houses, but dwelt under great Trees, and fed on dry’d Fish.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange adventure of nine <i>Spaniards</i>, meeting with great Giants.</div>

<p class='c010'>The next remark in this Voyage, was the discovery of an Island not far from
the former, where he found the Footsteps of a Gigantick People, upon which
nine <i>Spaniards</i> went a League to search the Countrey, where they saw five
great Huts, standing in a spacious Valley, and in them two old, and three
young Women, each of them being twice as tall as an ordinary Man: The
old ones invited the <i>Spaniards</i> to eat, who when they were sat down, consulting
how they might take and carry one of these Giantesses to <i>Spain</i>, there to
shew her for Money, thirty six Giants came in to them, (never did the Sun
shine on a more terrible People) which so amaz’d the <i>Spaniards</i>, that their Hair
seem’d to stand an end at the fear thereof: Every Giant was arm’d with a
Bow and Arrows, and a Club: They wondering at the nine strangers, stood
talking very earnestly one to another, which gave the <i>Spaniards</i> time to think
of making their escape; some judg’d it convenient to discharge their Guns upon
them, and in the Smoke to run away; others thought, that it would be better
to take a milder course, which they all agreed on; and taking their leave,
went out of the Hut, but were follow’d by the Giants, who kept a Stones cast
behind them, and went faster or slower, as the <i>Spaniards</i> slacken’d or mended
their pace; who at last getting to the Shore, and from thence into their Boats,
they suddenly put off; but the Giants then pursu’d them with eager speed, all
of them leaping into the Water, and Swimming, shot abundance of Arrows
after them; but frighted by the Thunder of two great Guns that were discharged
from the Ships, return’d ashore, and fled into the neighboring
Hills.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Vesputius</i> third Expedition.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span><i>Vesputius</i> at last began to consider of returning home, his Provisions beginning
to grow scarce, and his Sea-men faint, having continu’d in the Equinoctial
heats a whole year; wherefore he directed his course towards <i>Spain</i>,
in his Voyage, driving along the Coast an advantagious Trade, by bartering
Shells and Glass for Pearls. The Inhabitants presented him with Oysters, of
which some inclos’d one hundred and thirty Pearls; when they attain to their
full growth, they fall out of the Shells themselves, but those that stick, decay.
So upon the tenth of <i>November</i>, the Fleet came safe to an Anchor before <i>Cadiz</i>.
After which, <i>Vesputius</i> retired to <i>Sevil</i>, with intent to settle himself there, but
he had not long repos’d, when <i>Emanuel</i> King of <i>Portugal</i> sent for him to <i>Lisbon</i>,
and gave him the Command of three Ships, to discover new Countreys; between
the <i>Canaries</i> and <i>Africa</i>, they pass’d thorow so many Fishes (not unlike a
Bream) that in an hours time they loaded their Boats with them; this Fish
hath a round thin Scale, sharp Teeth, Stones in their Brains or Foreheads, a
sharp pointed Heart, a Bladder full of Wind, red Tail and Fins, feeds on Sea
Weeds, Gurnets and Oysters, and is of a delicious Taste.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cruel deed of some <i>Indian</i> Women.</div>

<p class='c010'>From thence, five degrees Southward of the Equinox, he found a naked
People on the top of a high Rock, that beckon’d the <i>Spaniards</i> to come towards
them; upon which, two of them resolv’d to venture thither, having order not
to stay at the most above five days: The first incounter they had was of some
Women, who offer’d their bodies to prostitution; but a Youth, as if affrighted
with some sudden danger, came running amongst them, whom, whilst they
stood gazing upon, and wondering at, an old Woman with a great Club, running
down the Hill overtook, and knock’d him down dead upon the ground;
which done, the Women that were making Court to the <i>Spaniards</i>, took him
by the Heels, and dragg’d up the Hill, where soon after they saw him chop’d
in pieces, Broyl’d, and eaten: They also made signs to the <i>Spaniards</i>, that they
would devour them also in the same manner. The Shore was crouded with
Men, which showr’d upon them several flights of Arrows; wherefore they
thought it best to Weigh Anchor, so taking Aboard their two Men, and having
Sail’d 150. Leagues, they got sight of the Coast of <i>Brasile</i>, along which he Sail’d
Southerly to fifty two Degrees, where three <i>Brasilians</i> came Aboard of their
own accord, and were easily perswaded to go with him to <i>Portugal</i>; but the
Weather growing very bad, and the Cold intollerable, the Storms swelling
the Waves into the bigness of Mountains, <i>Vesputius</i> left the Coast <i>des Patagones</i>,
and the <i>Streights</i>, afterwards call’d <i>Magellan</i>, behind him, burnt one of his Ships
before <i>Cape Sierra Leona</i>, and brought two safe to <i>Lisbon</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Vesputius</i> fourth Expedition.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Sea-Spiders, and Dragons.</div>

<p class='c010'>His fourth Expedition happen’d, <i>May 10. Anno 1503.</i> at which time he
Steer’d directly with six Sail to <i>Sierra Leona</i>, and approaching the Coast, could
not come to an Anchor, because of the strong eddying Currents: Three Degrees
beyond the Equinox appear’d a rising Island, two Leagues long, and
one broad, destitute of Inhabitants; his best Ship being six hundred Tun, split
here against a Rock, and nothing of her was saved, but the Sea-men: But <i>Vesputius</i>
Rowing ashore with a Boat, found a convenient Haven, with abundance
of sweet Water, high Trees, Sea-Spiders, and horrible Dragons, which
have a sharp Head, round fiery Eyes, and wide Mouths, Wings not unlike a
Bats, a speckled Breast, curl’d Tail, blew Back, and two Bags like a drawn
Satchel Triangular, were under their Bellies: No less strange are the Sea-Spiders,
by their hard Feet, long upper Teeth, two long Sheers or Pinchers,
and double Belly; between the Head and the Belly lies a black Skin, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>which they darken the Water; when any one goes to take them in the night,
they make a great shadow; they feed on Fish, the Female lays little white
Eggs, not unlike ordinary Hail-stones.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Vesputius</i> having left this desolate Isle, three hundred Leagues a Stern, enter’d
a Haven, to which he gave the name of St. <i>Abdy</i>, where he stay’d two Months,
expecting the return of those which he had sent into the Countrey; but seeing
it in vain to wait any longer, he proceeded on his Journey, and Sailing in between
the <i>Abrelhos</i>, in the River <i>Curubabo</i>, he built a strong Fort, Garrison’d it
with twenty four Men, twelve pieces of Ordnance, and Provisions for six
Moneths: Five Moneths <i>Vesputius</i> had spent in the building this Castle; when
he return’d home with one Ship, laden with <i>Brasill</i> Wood, where approaching
<i>Lisbon</i>, beyond all expectation, the Inhabitants of the City ran to Congratulate
his happy return. And from this <i>Americus Vesputius</i>, the <i>New World</i> is to this

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Americus Vesputius</i> was scarce fitted out in <i>Lisbon</i>, when <i>Fogeda</i> set Sail with
three hundred Men from <i>Beata</i>, the chiefest Haven of <i>Hispaniola</i>, to the
Island <i>Codego</i>, inhabited by Naked People, but of comely Personage, and withal
expert and most excellent Archers: Here he found a very strange Tree,
which bears a Fruit not unpleasing to the Palate, yet deadly Poyson, and besides,

<p class='c010'>Here <i>Fogeda</i> set upon a poor Village near the Sea-side, where without mercy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>he put them all to the Sword, except a few Youths which were onely saved,
that they might inform <i>Fogeda</i>, what was become of the slain and taken <i>Spaniards</i>;
Who told him, that according to their Custom, they had Roasted the
dead, and also their living Prisoners, and feasted on their Flesh. Here having
burnt the Houses, and sifting the Ashes, <i>Nicuesa</i> found some Gold. But now
they began to be distress’d for Provisions; for prevention of which, <i>Nicuesa</i>
had given order to <i>Ancisus</i>, Marshal in <i>Hispaniola</i>, that he should follow with
a Ship of Victual, for the Army to <i>Codega</i>. But he being kept back by inconveniencies,
most of the <i>Spaniards</i> were famish’d, so that the three hundred Men
which <i>Codega</i> brought from <i>Hispaniola</i>, were reduced to sixty. And he was already
under-Sail to <i>Hispaniola</i>, when <i>Ancisus</i> Anchor’d in the Haven of <i>Codegoos</i>,
and sent some Men ashore to mend his Boat, and fetch fresh Water, which
whilst they were doing, the Natives came flocking about them: Three days
they fac’d one another, using no Hostility, when at last a <i>Spaniard</i> that understood
the <i>Codegan</i> Tongue, adventuring to fetch Water, he was immediately
encompassed; when speaking to them, and informing them in their own Language,
That he was none of <i>Fogedas</i> or <i>Nicuesas</i> People, which not long since
had committed so great slaughter, they left him, and the rather, because he
told them, that <i>Ancisus</i> would take revenge on them, if they did any wrong to
him. Thus quieted, they brought all sorts of Provisions Aboard. Mean while,
<i>Ancisus</i> Sail’d to the Main Continent <i>Uraba</i>, where in the Mouth of a Haven he
ran his Vessel aground, which was bilg’d; the Sea-men taking some Arms along
with them, sav’d their lives by swimming ashore; where, their first sustenance
they found was store of Peaches and Cherries, which was a great refreshment
in those hot Countreys, but yet had undoubtedly been starv’d, but that in searching
the Wood for Fruits, they found Wild-Swine, which preserv’d their lives;
yet they were not free from apparent danger, having to deal with a Salvage
People, into whose hands they were so unfortunately cast by Shipwrack; however
<i>Ancisus</i> set a good face on the business, marching with a hundred Men up
into the Countrey, where some of the <i>Urabanners</i> from an ambuscade unawares,
with their Arrows wounded several of his Men, hereupon they retreated to
the Shore of the River <i>Daria</i>, whither also they had brought the small Boats,
sav’d from the Wreck; where whilst they were in consultation how to return
to <i>Hispaniola</i>, the Inhabitants having muster’d themselves, and making a Body
of five hundred Men, set upon them, who after a sharp Conflict, made them
retreat, and at last to flie, whom <i>Ancisus</i> pursuing, found in a Thicket of Canes
or Reeds a great Treasure of Gold. Mean while, <i>Nicuesa</i> Sail’d to the plentiful
Golden Countrey <i>Veragua</i> with three Ships, of which he lost two, the
one Commanded by <i>Lupus de Olana</i>, and the other by <i>Peter Umbria Olana</i>, which
was stranded in the River <i>Veragua</i>, which gives name to the whole Island, but
he built a new <i>Carvil</i>, whereas that of <i>Lupus Olana</i> was bilg’d among the Rocks.
Little better success had <i>Nicuesa</i>, whose Ship over-turning with a Tempest, he
with a few of his Men made land upon <i>Veragua</i>, where he rang’d up and down
in a miserable condition, on a barren, and in a manner desolate Shore seventy
days: All that time, finding no other Food than Wild Roots, who wandring
up and down, at last met with <i>Olana</i>, a little before cast away on the same Isle,
whom he secur’d, because he presum’d to usurp the Title, and be prime Commander
of that Countrey. Upon which, the <i>Spaniards</i> being divided, some
for <i>Ancisus</i>, some for <i>Olana</i>, the difference more and more encreasing, would not
be reconcil’d, till the Famine over-powering, master’d both, so that not being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>able to handle their Arms, the Salvages flew them at their pleasure, by this
means in a short time, of seven hundred eighty five, remain’d scarce ninety;
yet did not all this misery work any thing upon the ambitious humor of <i>Vasques
Nunnez</i>, who rebelling against <i>Ancisus</i>, split that small remainder of Men,
and with the help of those he had drawn over to his Party, made himself Governor
of <i>Uraba</i>, not possible to be long enjoy’d without speedy supply, which
soon after they receiv’d; for <i>Colmenares</i> Sailing from <i>Hispaniola</i> with Provisions,
arriv’d there the 15. of <i>October, Anno 1510</i>. having been toss’d twenty three days
at Sea; then making into the River <i>Gaira</i>, to furnish himself with fresh Water,
he lost forty seven Men; for whilst they were filling their Casks, seven
hundred of the Salvages came down upon them, and with their Poyson’d
Arrows wounded and kill’d most of them. <i>Colmenares</i> came in a good time to
the remainder under <i>Ancisus</i> Command, being in danger of death for want of
Provisions, and finding the factions that were among them about Superiority,
he thought it fit, consulting with some of the chiefest of them, to find out <i>Nicuesa</i>,
who was indeed the Governor that had the Grant from the King: This
agreed, <i>Colmenares</i> went to search, and at last lighted upon him, building a Fortress
against the assaults of the Enemies on the Promontory. <i>Mormor</i>, he was
glad to find him, but griev’d to see the misery and hardship they endur’d, most
of his Men being kill’d, partly by the excessive Heats, partly by Famine, and
partly by the cruelty of the Natives, so that he had onely sixty remaining, and
those many of them also sick and weak.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Colmenares</i> having deliver’d his Message, <i>Nicuesa</i> broke up his Quarters, and
sleighting the Fort, went with him, but both himself and his Men were oppos’d
from Landing by <i>Nunnez</i>; wherefore <i>Nicuesa</i> was necessitated to Steer
for <i>Hispaniola</i>; whom, or what became of him was never known.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Nunnez</i> having thus quitted himself of <i>Nicuesa</i>, and now, more than ever,
wanting Provision, he resolv’d to take out his own Commission at large, and
setting up for himself, make no discrimination of Persons, <i>Spaniards</i>, or Natives,
but to make out his Fortune.</p>

<p class='c010'>And first, he fell upon <i>Careta</i> King of <i>Coita</i>, whom he took Prisoner, Plundering
him of all his Treasure and Provisions; yet this sufficed not long, for soon
after, King <i>Poncha</i> invading <i>Careta</i>, <i>Nunnez</i> took hold of that opportunity, and

who immediately fled, and left all to the spoil of his Enemies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable Pallace of King <i>Comogrus</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>This News so amaz’d <i>Comogrus</i>, another King, that he proffer’d Peace; whereupon
<i>Nunnez</i> going thither, was nobly entertain’d in his Palace, being one hundred
and fifty Paces long, and eighty broad, the Floors Pav’d with Stone, and
the Roofs Vaulted, his Cellars were stor’d with Wine, made of the Root <i>Jucca</i>,
<i>Ages</i>, and <i>Mais</i>; the Privy-Chamber was hung round with dead bodies,
Mummy’d artificially with Lent Fires, and were the Corpses of <i>Comogrus</i> Ancestors,
and others of the Royal Blood, and nearest Relations, of whom some
dy’d at least four hundred years before; each of these fasten’d by Cordage
made of Reeds, were Habited in Cotton, richly adorn’d with Pearls and Gold.
Mean while, a Hurricane happening, terrible with Thunder and Lightning,
and hideous Gusts, swell’d and so enrag’d the Sea, that breaking its bounds,
over-running, drown’d the whole Champain; thus the hopes of a fruitful Harvest
being utterly lost, they suffer’d under a great Famine.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Nunnez</i> Exploits.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spaniards</i> which Encamp’d near the River <i>Daria</i>, on <i>Uraba</i>, perceiving
this, and knowing they had no manner of supply from <i>Hispaniola</i>, and having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>already Pillag’d the Neighboring Kings, that they had nothing left. <i>Nunnez</i>
marching thirty Leagues up the River, Plunder’d the Village, of which <i>Daibaiba</i>
was King, where he found an unvaluable quantity of Gold, but little or
no Provision. Here were many Flitter Mice, or Bats, bigger than Turtle
Doves, whose biting was mortal, unless immediately wash’d with Salt Water,
according to the information of the Prisoners.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now as <i>Nunnez Uraba</i> Pillag’d towards the South, so did <i>Colmenares</i>, setting
up also for himself, make prize of all, to the East with sixty Men, Rowing
against the Stream up the River <i>Daria</i>, above twelve Leagues, where he found
in several Villages and Hamlets, and at King <i>Turvi</i>’s Palace, abundance, both
of Provision and Gold; from thence he March’d to the mighty Province <i>Abenamchei</i>,
which though making some resistance, at last they subdu’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A strange Pallace built on Trees.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Turning the low Land into a Sea.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>A Plot on the <i>Spaniards</i>, strangely discover’d.</div>

<p class='c010'>And the neighboring King <i>Abibeiba</i> narrowly escap’d the like fortune, whose
Pallace was built on the tops of Trees, Plash’d, and Pleited together, Timber
Beams lying athwart; necessity forcing them to choose such high Habitations,
partly to avoid the Inundations of Rivers, swoln above their bounds by sudden
and almost assiduous Showres from the Mountains; and partly, to be free
from the excursions of sculking Robbers; also being better able to defend
themselves in these Castles in the Air, and also secur’d by their heighth from
their Shot, being above the reach of their <i>Indian</i> Arrows: The bodies of the
Trees downwards, upon which the Houses are built, are generally twenty four
Fathom thick, so that they cannot easily be cut down, nor fired; but <i>Colmenares</i>
against these, as they suppos’d, impregnable Forts, having made a Gallery
with several great Hurdles, set his Men to work under that safeguard, with
Axes on the Tree whereon <i>Abibeiba</i>’s House stood, who seeing his imminent
danger, wondring at this new manner of Storming, came down, promising
to furnish him with Gold out of the neighboring Mountains, notwithstanding
it would be with the danger of his Life; because the <i>Cannibals</i> generally
kill those that adventur’d to dig in the Mines: To this promise, <i>Colmenares</i>
hearken’d, and having set him at liberty, for the performance, he in stead thereof,
on the contrary, stirr’d up, and joyn’d with all the Conquer’d Kings, to
destroy him and his Men: Nor were they slack to have executed their design,
five thousand of them being already drawn together at the Village <i>Tirichi</i>, the
appointed place of Rendezvous, and so privately carry’d, that undoubtedly it
had been effected, if not happily discover’d by this accident.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Nunnez</i>, amongst his other Slavesses, had one exceeding beautiful, on
which he was much Enamour’d, and she likewise seem’d to bear as great
an affection towards him, which she manifested, by declaring the secret to
<i>Nunnez</i> which her Brother had imparted to her, being an intended general
Massacre the night following, that so she might the better make her escape
the day before;  yet so much she prefer’d the safety of her Lover, before
the liberty of her Native Countrey, that she discover’d the Plot. <i>Nunnez</i> not
sleeping on this advice, on a sudden set so fiercely upon the Conspirators, that
he utterly broke their design; yet the Feuds and Contests for Superiority still
continu’d amongst them, which look’d with so bad a Face to the ruine of all,
that news thereof arriving in <i>Spain</i>, it was judg’d fit to send for <i>Colmenares</i>, and
<i>John Quicedo</i> to the Court, there to render an account of all their Transactions,
Both going Aboard a small Vessel, were by Storm driven on the Coast of <i>Cuba</i>,
where they were inform’d from a Prisoner, that <i>Valdivia</i> and <i>Zamudio</i>, driven
ashore by Shipwrack, and not able to defend themselves, were surpriz’d by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>the Natives, kill’d and eaten; that <i>Fogeda</i> driven up and down along the
Coast, had lost most of his People by hunger, and other hardship, and himself
with much ado getting to <i>Hispaniola</i>, dy’d as soon as Landed of the Wound
which he receiv’d by a Poysonous Arrow, near the River <i>Daria</i>.</p>

a King, who suffer’d himself to be Christen’d, and call’d <i>Commendator</i>; and
building a Church, Consecrated it to the Virgin <i>Mary</i>; in it he erected an
Image of Clay, resembling a Woman, which he clothed in a Cotton Garment;
round about were plac’d Pots with Meat and Water, according to their
old Idolatrous fashion, otherwise, they believ’d their Idols would devour the
Souls of the Dead, and this, though Christians, they did not forget.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nay further, when he went to War, he carry’d the Image of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>
with him in the Front of his Army, often saying, <i>Ave Maria</i>; and this was the
end of that Voyage: But afterwards <i>Ancisus</i> complain’d against <i>Vascus Nunnez</i>
in the <i>Spanish</i> Court, where he receiv’d a Sentence very prejudicial to him. <i>Colmenares</i>
and <i>Quicedo</i> had also Audience there, whereupon matters being settled,

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Peter Arias</i> Knight, accompany’d with his Wife, <i>Elizabeth Boadilla</i>, set Sail
<i>Anno 1514.</i> but surpriz’d by a violent Storm, lost two Ships, and return’d
to <i>Spain</i>, yet not long after began his Voyage afresh, notwithstanding he had
lately had such bad success, and heard of the great hardship which <i>Nicuesa</i> suffer’d,
having not onely kept himself alive a considerable time by feeding on

<div class='sidenote'>Is in great danger on the South-Sea.</div>

<p class='c010'>But <i>Vaschus Nunnez</i> inform’d of <i>Arias</i> arrival, the chief Governor of <i>Uraba</i>,
afterwards call’d <i>New Andaluzia</i>, minding to inrich himself before he should depose
him, and hearing that several Gold Mines lay Southward from <i>Uraba</i>,
march’d thither with a hundred and ninety Men, thorow great Rivers, Thickets,
and Woods full of Wild Beasts, deep Vallies, and broad Rivers, not without
many hazards and difficulties. In the Mountainous Territory <i>Quarequan</i>,
the Inhabitants ingag’d him valiantly, with Bows, Arrows, Clubs, Woodden
Swords, Pikes and Launces, but frighted with the meer report of their Musquets,
like flocks of wild Fowl, dissipated and fled, but not so fast, but that
six hundred of them fell by the hands of the <i>Spaniards</i>, or were worry’d by their
Dogs, train’d up on purpose for the <i>American</i> Wars. Soon after, coming into the
Palace, there sate his Brother dress’d up in Womens Apparel, whom the King
kept to abuse, as if a Concubine, whereof <i>Nunnez</i> being inform’d, in detestation
of Sodomy, set the Dogs upon him, who suddenly tore him in pieces.
Amongst the slain were found several <i>Negroes</i>, which suffering Shipwrack had
been cast on the <i>American</i> Shore, and maintain’d a continual War with the <i>Quaraquanen</i>,
so that it seem’d the <i>Blacks</i> which were found dead amongst them
were their Slaves: Yet <i>Nunnez</i> was forc’d to leave a considerable number of
his Men here, who being half starv’d, and quite tired out, were not able to
follow him; but with the remaining party he march’d on, and at last came to
the high Mountains, from whence he saw the great South-Sea, and going thither,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>was met by King <i>Chiapes</i>, leading an Army of thirty thousand Men,
which great Body stood not long to make resistance, being terrifi’d with the
Vollyes of Shot, whose Report the ecchoing Valleys presented to their Ears,
double and trebble: And that which most amaz’d and disanimated them in
the rout, were the Dogs, who fiercely pursu’d and seiz’d the flyers, tearing
away great morsels of Flesh. After the Battel, the Conqueror proffer’d Peace,
which was agreed on, upon the delivery of several great Presents of Gold. After
that, <i>Chiapes</i> the King, accompany’d with <i>Nunnez</i> the <i>Spanish</i> Commander,
and March’d with him over a broad River to <i>Coquera</i>, where at first some Forces
made resistance, but were routed; whereupon, they also suddenly struck
up a Peace, upon conditions, that the Prince, nam’d also <i>Coquera</i>, should return
him a great quantity of Gold. Here he found a handsome Bay running up in
crooked Reaches, above sixty Leagues, which <i>Nunnez</i> call’d St. <i>Michael</i>, being
sprinkled with Islands, and treacherous with hidden Rocks. There <i>Nunnez</i>,
(though disswaded by <i>Chiapes</i>, because he knew the South-Sea at that time being
the three last Moneths of the Year, was exceeding turbulent, that no Vessel
could hardly live in it, yet) ventur’d with nine <i>Indian</i> Boats, and eighty Men
from the Shore into the <i>Offin</i>; where, notwithstanding the high rolling of the
Waves, he got to an uninhabited Island, on which, being necessitated to stay a
night, the Tide flow’d so much, according to the property of the South-Sea,
that the highest Ground thereon, lay almost cover’d with Water, every one of
the <i>Spaniards</i> having enough to do to save themselves from being wash’d away.
Day approaching, discover’d a second inconveniency, for the <i>Indian</i> <i>Canoos</i> either
were extremely Leaky, or else so shatter’d, that they were unfit for service;
yet notwithstanding all this, they ventur’d to return, rather choosing to be devour’d
in the Waves, than die of that hunger, whose misery they had sufficiently
tasted, during the small time they had been out. Not long after, <i>Nunnez</i>
Conquer’d the King <i>Tamaccus</i> in a Field Battel, who thereupon purchas’d his
Peace with great Presents of Gold and Pearl. He also shew’d the <i>Spaniards</i> an
Island, whose spiring tops were seen from the Main Land, which so abounded
in Pearls, that in no place were either more or fairer to be found: But the
King who liv’d on it was exceeding powerful.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Manner of Fishing for Pearls.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span><i>Nunnez</i> immediately resolv’d to Sail thither, notwithstanding it was the
middle of <i>October</i>, when the South-East Winds make such a turbulent and hollow
Sea, as many times wash’d away Trees and pieces of Rocks: Besides, the
Weather was more terrible, by continual Lightning and great Thunder-Claps;
the Nights very cold, the Days exceeding hot; yet all these difficulties could
not prevail, for <i>Nunnez</i> would not stay to expect fairer Weather, but went on,
and coming thither, he saw how the <i>Indians</i> Fish for Pearls, which was Diving
for Oysters; but the Weather being rough and foul, they durst not venture for
the best which lay far from the Shore.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Nunnez</i> returns.</div>

<p class='c010'>But <i>Nunnez</i> leaving his sick and weary’d Men with <i>Chiapes</i>, March’d quite
another way back than he came; and crossing a great River, was receiv’d by
Prince <i>Teaocha</i>, who furnish’d him with Gold, Pearls, Provisions, and Guides,
which carry’d his Luggage and Goods.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Pacra</i> a tyrannous King, his horrible death.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Pacra</i>, a great Oppressor of all his Neighbors, hearing of the approach of
<i>Nunnez</i>, fled, but terrifi’d with threats, return’d with three other Princes,
which were all so Deform’d, that more horrible Monsters were never seen,
scarce any part about them resembling those of a Man: The Guides which
<i>Teaocha</i> had provided for the <i>Spaniard</i> desir’d that he might be put to Death, for
the Cruelties which he had long committed; whose Request being granted, he
with the other three Princes, were given as a Breakfast to the <i>Spanish</i> Doggs.
Mean while, the <i>Spaniards</i> were in danger to have perish’d for want of Water;
yet at last, in a Thicket of Brambles, they found a small Brook, but none of the
<i>Indians</i> durst venture to go to it, for fear of Tygers, and other Wild Beasts;
relating, That the Tygers took many people in the nights out of their Huts, if
they were not careful in making fast their Doors.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange relations of a Tyger.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>John Ledesma</i> had himself eaten part of a Tyger, which for six Moneths together,
had every night feasted on Mans flesh, or Beasts, which they caught in this
manner: In the Path along which he pass’d, coming out of his Den to seek for
Prey, a deep Pit was digg’d, and cover’d very sleightly on the top, into which
the Tyger fell; yet though taken, so fiercely withstood the Pikes, Darts, and
Stones thrown at him, that every one was amaz’d to see the fury of the Beast.
After that they sought for the Female, but found onely two young ones without
a Dam, which taking along with them, they put Iron Collars about their
Necks, intending to carry them to <i>Spain</i>; but seeing no likelyhood of breeding
them up, they brought them back again, purposing to fetch them away
when grown somewhat older, and accordingly coming afterwards to look for
them, they found the Den empty, so that it was supposed they had been devour’d
by their Dam.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Nunnez</i> further Journey into the Countrey, very remarkable.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the Province of <i>Bononiama</i>, the <i>Spaniards</i> inrich’d themselves with Chains,
and Breast-Plates of Gold, which in great plenty hung on the Walls in every
House: At the River <i>Comogrus</i>, they discharg’d <i>Teaocha</i>’s Guides, and made use
of <i>Cotog</i> and <i>Ciuriza</i>, two Governors of a barren Tract of Land, full of Hills
and Mountains, which they left on their right Hand, and wandred three days
over a <i>Morasse</i>, in which they often sunk to their Knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>In all these Travels, Victual was so scarce that they were much weaken’d
by their wants; and though they took fresh courage when they got footing on
King <i>Buchebua</i>’s Jurisdiction, yet they found nothing but empty Huts; and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>like in the Countrey of <i>Chiorisus</i>, both having a little before been pillag’d by
their more powerful neighboring Enemies. But although they could not furnish
<i>Nunnez</i> with Provisions, they presented him with weighty Ingots of Gold:
but this rich Metal not able to purchase the least morsel of Bread, drove them
into a great strait; and indeed they had without doubt been all famished,
had not <i>Pocchorosa</i>, another King, fed them forty days together with stamp’d
Roots. Thus refresh’d, and instigated by <i>Pocchorosa</i>, they broke by night in
<i>Tubunama</i>’s Palace, and took him Prisoner with eighty Concubines, who
fearing to be put to death, gave an incredible Treasure of Gold to purchase
his Ransom.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Nunnez</i> thus enriched came at last to his People which he had left on the
River <i>Daria</i>, where two Ships sent from <i>Hispaniola</i> rode at an Anchor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Peter Arias</i> his Voyage, and Fight in the Haven <i>St. Martha</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Whilst things were thus carry’d in <i>America</i>, <i>Peter Arias</i> Sail’d with fifteen
Ships, Mann’d with fifteen hundred Men, to <i>New Andalusia</i>, by the Islands
<i>Martinina</i>, <i>Guadalupe</i>, and <i>Galanta</i>, all in <i>America</i>: a considerable time he Sail’d
through the Sea overgrown with Weeds. Afterwards anchoring in the Haven
<i>St. Martha</i>, he receiv’d a great repulse from the Natives, who no ways daunted
at the bigness of the Ships, waded up to their Breasts in the Sea, and shot many
great flights of poisonous Arrows at the <i>Spaniards</i>, or whom two being wounded
immediately died. <i>Arias</i> sending some of his Men ashore, they found many
Boats lying full of Nets, made of tough Weeds, and Ropes pleited of
Rushes.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Haven <i>St. Martha</i>, being three Leagues wide, are abundance of Fish,
which may be seen under Water twenty Fathom deep.</p>

<p class='c010'>But now the <i>Spaniards</i> that were ashore breaking into the Houses, and taking
Women and Children Prisoners, the <i>Americans</i> prepar’d for another Fight,
which at the beginning was very fierce; but at last they were forc’d to quit the
Field.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Houses and Houshold-stuff.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Houses and Furniture in them are worthy of observation: their Cielings
being cover’d with Shells strung on small Thred, which make a pleasing
noise, when mov’d by the least breath of Wind. The Walls are hung with fine
Stuffs, woven full of Imagery, as Cranes, Lyons, Tygers, and some Figures of
Men; the Floors are cover’d with parti-colour’d Mats, made of Sea-Reeds,
and several tough Roots; and their Carpets beset with Pearl add also a great
beauty to their Rooms.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Valleys the <i>Spaniards</i> found several precious Jems, as Saphires, Jasper,
Emeralds, and great pieces of Amber, and in some Huts, Baskets, and
Chests full of dry’d Locusts, and Crabs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here also grows the Root <i>Yuca</i>, as also on several other <i>West-Indian</i> Coasts, of
which they make their best Bread, and is call’d in <i>Hispaniola</i> and <i>Angola</i>, <i>Yuca</i>;
by the <i>Brasilians</i>, <i>Mandiba</i> and <i>Mandihoka</i>; by the <i>Mexicans</i>, <i>Quauhcamotli</i>: it
grows with a thick or midling Body, according to the fruitfulness or barrenness
of the Soil; the Leaves are like those of a Tulip, and have small Flowers
and Seed, but no ways useful; the Root, not unlike Horse-Raddish, hath a
milky Juice, which swells it exceedingly; the Sprigs, which in the eighth and
tenth Moneth shoot out of the Root, serve for new Plants; and if at any time
it happen, that either by a moist Season, or by Worms, or Pismires, the Plant
is spoil’d, then it occasions such an inconvenience amongst the Inhabitants,
that half of them in that year die of Famine.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What use the <i>Americans</i> make of the Root <i>Mandihoka</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Leaves of the <i>Mandihoka</i> serve them for Sallads. Out of the Root,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>which they lay soaking five days in Water, they make Meal, which the <i>Portuguese</i>
call <i>Farina fresca</i>, but the <i>Americans</i>, <i>Vipeba</i>. Moreover, <i>Mandihoka</i> serves
them to make Bread, which they bake over the Fire; and mix’d with Water,
Pepper, and the Flour <i>Nhambi</i>, makes an excellent Pudding, by them call’d
<i>Mingaude Carima</i>, no less pleasing to the taste than wholsom Food: and with
Orange-Flour, Water, and Sugar, it makes that excellent Julep <i>Tipioca</i>. The
Powder of <i>Mandihoka</i> put into a Wound, cures very speedily. It is very pleasant
to see the <i>Americans</i> eat this Bread; for they toss it by handfuls at a pretty
distance from their Mouthes without letting fall the least Crum. Lastly, it
requires great art and trouble to make the <i>Mandihoka</i> fit for Bread: first they
must peel off the Shell, then put into a Mill turn’d by two <i>Indians</i> it falls,
being Ground, into a square Trough. The Juice proceeding from it is mortal,
if eaten when raw, but wholsom if boil’d: the Meal they put in a Press, and
when all the moisture is drawn from it, they strow it in an Oven to dry. But
the wild <i>Mandihoka</i>, by those that live on the Sea-shore call’d <i>Cuacu Mandiiba</i>,
and up in the Countrey, <i>Cuquacucuremia</i>, differs both in shape and goodness
from the first.</p>

<p class='c010'>But to return to our matter: <i>Arias</i> coming to an Anchor in the River <i>Daria</i>,
was cheerfully receiv’d by <i>Nunnez</i>; his first Business which he undertook was
the building of three Forts, to secure the Passages to the <i>South Sea</i>; to which
purpose <i>Joannes Aiora</i> received the Command over four hundred Workmen.
Moreover, <i>Arias</i> took great dislike in the Place call’d <i>Maria Antiqua</i>, which the
<i>Spaniards</i> were forc’d by necessity first to Plant in: it lay in a deep Valley between
high Mountains, so that it not onely wanted the benefit of the rising and
setting of the Sun, but when in or near the Meridian, it shin’d down upon
them, and scorch’d all their Plants, and the tepifi’d Morassy Grounds about
the same infected the Air, and the Water which they took up to wash their
Houses, immediately bred Frogs, the River <i>Daria</i> overflow’d the Grounds
with his muddy Water three Leagues distance from the Sea; the Passage thither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>also was very troublesom, because of the uneven Ways; and besides, the Tygers
and Lyons devour’d many People and Cattel.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A strange Accident.</div>

<p class='c010'>The first Night that <i>Arias</i> lay in <i>Maria Antiqua</i>, the House wherein his Chirurgion
Lodg’d was fir’d with Lightning, who running out with his Wife, being
both scorched by the Flames, saw a very great Crocodile, which snatching
up his Dog ran away with him towards the River.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable Trees.</div>

<p class='c010'>The neighboring Territory <i>Coiba</i> produced Trees, whose Timber us’d for
Shipping never breeds Worms, because of its acerbity; whereas on the contrary,
all other Vessels in that Countrey are very subject to that inconvenience.
Here also grow those famous Plague-Trees, whose very Leaves, if but falling
upon one, are like Gods Arrows, mortal, and immediately kill, unless the Place
whereon they light be straightway anointed with fasting Spittle: and the <i>Coibensers</i>
say, that they know another poysonous Wood, which they use to destroy
their Enemies withall.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable Journey of <i>Moralis</i> to the <i>South Sea</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Whilst <i>Arias</i> was consulting about the beforemention’d Affairs, he sent several
Comanders to divers Places, to take a survey, and give him an account of
their Return of all their Discoveries. Amongst others <i>Gasper Moralis</i> was order’d
to march towards the <i>South Sea</i>, to confirm the Peace which <i>Nunnez</i> had begun
with the Kings <i>Chiapes</i> and <i>Tumaccus</i>; and chiefly to go to the Pearl-Island with
sixty Men, which <i>Nunnez</i> was forc’d to leave, being stress’d by tempestuous
Weather. <i>Chiapes</i> and <i>Tumaccus</i> were according to their promise, to prepare an
Army ready for his assistance against his coming; which indeed they perform’d,
so that they wanted nothing but Vessels, for the biggest of theirs could
not carry above three or four Men; yet they undertaking their Enterprise,
Landed seventy Men on the Island; upon which the Inhabitants under their
Kings Conduct ran to meet the new Landed Forces, and crying out aloud
<i>Guazzavara</i>, <i>Guazzavara</i>, they ran in amongst the Musqueteers with their woodden
Swords; but the report of the Guns, mix’d with Fire, Smoak, and Bullets,
soon amaz’d them: the King flying, thought by alarm to raise all the Islanders;
but they being inform’d, that no People whatsoever could withstand the
fire-spitting People, made Articles of agreement with <i>Moralis</i>, and Condition’d
to deliver a hundred pound weight of the choicest Pearls to the use of the King
of <i>Castile</i>; and as a testimony of his Friendship he was Christen’d <i>Peter Arias</i>,
from the Governors Name of <i>New Andalusia</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Pearl.</div>

<p class='c010'>How great the Treasure was which <i>Moralis</i> brought from the Pearl Island
may appear by one of the Pearls, for which Pope <i>Leo</i> the tenth gave forty
four thousand <i>Ducats</i> to a <i>Venetian</i> Merchant.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Solisius</i> his miserable end.</div>

<p class='c010'>Amongst the Commanders which were sent out by <i>Arias</i>, was also <i>Johannes
Solisius</i>, who Sailing six hundred Leagues Southerly, along the Coast of the
<i>Caribbies</i>, beyond <i>Cape St. Augustine</i>, he found the Inhabitants of <i>Pernambuck</i> to
be no less cruel than subtile; for being invited ashore, he with some of
his Men Row’d thither, where no sooner Landing, but were all kill’d and
eaten in the sight of the other Sea-men aboard; at which being amaz’d they
weighed Anchor, and Sail’d away, Freighted onely with <i>Brasile</i> Wood, to
<i>Cadiz</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Also<a id='t74'></a> in an unhappy hour did <i>Johannes Pontæus</i> put some of his Laundresses
ashore on the Island <i>Guadalupa</i>, to wash some Linnen for him; for the Islanders
coming on a sudden out of the Woods surpriz’d them, and forthwith killing
without mercy, cut them in pieces, and carbonadoing, eat their broil’d
Flesh hot from the Coals, while <i>Gonsalus Badajocius</i> Sail’d with eighty Men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Westerly, and having gone sixty Leagues he went ashore, and spent some days in
vain, to Court the <i>Americans</i> to a friendly correspondency; which whilst he was
doing, he was recruited with fifty Men from <i>Daria</i>, Commanded by <i>Lodowick
Mercado</i>: so both agreed together to travel over the Mountains to the <i>South Sea</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Slaves.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Great Booty.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Governor <i>Juana</i>, whose Jurisdictions abound in Gold, flying with most
part of his Treasure, was never heard of, onely they took some of his Slaves,
whose Faces were strangely Carv’d with sharp Fish-bones, the Wounds
fill’d with red and black Powder, which so discolour’d the Flesh that it could
never be got out. After that they travell’d through the Wilderness five days
together, being onely met by some <i>Indians</i> carrying <i>Maiz</i>, who signifi’d to them,
that King <i>Periguete</i> liv’d along the Sea-shore, and up into the Countrey the
blind <i>Totonoga</i>; of both which they got an unvaluable Treasure of Gold.
Amongst other Pieces of that rich Metal was one which weighed two pound.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Taracura</i> rais’d in this Expedition eighteen thousand weight of Gold: and
little less did they take out of the Territories belonging to the Princes <i>Pananome</i>,
<i>Tabor</i>, <i>Cheru</i>, and <i>Scoria</i>: The Prisoners serv’d them in stead of Horses,
they not being able to carry all the Gold themselves, the meanest Soldier having
above three thousand Pounds <i>Sterling</i> for his share.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Destruction of the <i>Spaniards</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>They were now got to <i>Panza</i>’s Kingdom, not without leaving sad remarks,
of their avarice and cruelties. When <i>Pariza</i> surrounding this Party thus loaden
with Gold, Charged so fiercely, that at the first Assault seventy of them were
slain; those few that escap’d brought the tidings of their sad misfortune to
<i>Peter Arias</i>. Amongst those that escaping return’d, was <i>Franciscus Delapuente</i>,
whose observations concerning catching Parrots and wild Fowl, we will
briefly relate, the digression being but short.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A strange way to catch Parrots.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Indian</i> where the Parrots are most frequent climbs into a Tree, and
chattering like them, with his Voice imitating their Notes, allures his fellow-prater
to draw near, and suffer him to take them in his Hands. But more
belongs to the taking of wild Fowl, as Geese, Ducks, Swans, and the like:
From the bottom of their standing Pools and Lakes in that Countrey grow
Weeds, which spreading upon the Water ripen, and rotting breed Water-Flies,
Spiders, and Frogs, upon which the Fowls feed. Near these Pools in
the Gardens grow Cabbages as high as Trees, which often dropping into the
Water serve the Birds both for Nests and Food: but the skilful Fowler finds
it his best way to take one of these Cabbages, and making it hollow in the
middle, claps it on his Head like a Helmet, then going into the Water up to
his Chin, and passing softly along in such manner, that nothing is seen but the
floating Cabbage, and coming near the Birds, he takes them one after another
by the Legs, and puts them into a Bag ty’d about his middle for that purpose.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Bird <i>Toucan</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>But what is more worthy observation is the <i>American</i> Bird <i>Toucan Xochitenachate</i>,
having a fleshy Bill, like a Mouth full of Teeth, which continually opens
and shuts to draw Breath, having no Nostrils; the Back, Neck, and Wings,
are black, the Breast yellow like Gold, the Belly and end of the Tail of a
Vermillion colour.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Evacuated Pepper.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Bird <i>Toucan</i> feeds for the most part on Pepper, which tarries not long
with them, but muted almost as soon as swallowed: which Pepper thus evacuated
the Natives value above their common, because the unpleasing sharp
acidity, or biting quality is thereby much mitigated.</p>

<p class='c010'>But to return: Whilst the Expeditions under the Command of <i>Peter Arias</i>
had such bad success, <i>Arias</i> himself and <i>Vaschus Nunnez</i> hapned to clash: <i>Nun</i><i>nez</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>who since his discovery of the <i>South Sea</i> was held in some repute at the
<i>Spanish</i> Court, had built four Ships on the Shore of the same Ocean, to make
farther inspections along the Coasts thereof: but being commanded to come
to <i>Arias</i> the Governor, he was committed to Prison, and accused of high Treason,
as if he had intentions to settle himself in <i>Peru</i>, and absolutely to have left
<i>Daria</i>: all which though he disown’d, and utterly deni’d with great protestations
when brought to a Trial, and no witness to affirm the contrary, yet was
by <i>Arias</i>’s special Order Beheaded.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not long after which <i>Lupus Sosa</i>, Governor of the <i>Canary</i> Islands, was sent to

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Fernandez</i>, <i>Caizedus</i>, and <i>Morantes</i>, antient Planters in <i>Cuba</i>, obtain’d a Licence
from the Governor <i>Diego Velasques</i>, to Rig out three Ships with a hundred
and ten Men to discover new Lands. <i>Velasques</i> thought fit to add one more
to their number upon the Kings account; which Trust he committed to <i>Igniguez</i>:
all of them consulted with the experienc’d Navigator <i>Antonio Alamines</i>.
Six days the Fleet had been at Sea, when they discover’d Land, which by a
mistake was call’d <i>Jucatan</i>, because the Inhabitants being ask’d what was the
Name of the Coast, answer’d <i>Jucatan</i>; which, as the <i>Spaniards</i> were afterwards
inform’d, signifi’d, <i>We understand you not</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Stately City.</div>

<p class='c010'>Upon the Shore they found a City, whose Stone Buildings, with stately
Fronts and high Turrets, shew’d most magnificently. <i>Fernandez</i> call’d this
City for its wonderful bigness, <i>Cairo</i>, from the <i>Egyptian</i> Metropolis, famous
through the World.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Campechium</i> a City.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable Images, and strange Stage.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spaniards</i> coming to Land were courteously receiv’d, and conducted into
the City; the neatness of whose Market-places, and exactness of their
Streets, they beheld with admiration; as also the costly Stuff Garments both
of Men and Women: but their wonder increas’d when they beheld very artificial
Crosses, concerning which upon inquiry they related, That a Man more
glorious than the Sun, being busie in erecting the Crosses, died. But these
People, though so courteous and civil at first, seem’d in few days to be weary
of their company; which the <i>Spaniards</i> observing sounded a Retreat, and Sailing
Westerly, proceeded on their intended Design, and soon after anchor’d
before <i>Campechium</i>; the King of which conducted <i>Fernandez</i> and <i>Morantes</i>, with
some others, into the City, consisting of three thousand Houses. In his Palace
they were entertain’d with all manner of Fowl roasted: After which refreshment
they survey’d the City; in which, amongst other curious Buildings, was
a high, but square Theatre of Marble, on which stood the Image of a Man, on
all corners assaulted by four wild Beasts, which were of a no less strange than
horrible shape. Not far from this Image they saw a Serpent fashion’d up of
Chalk and little Stones, whose coyl’d up Tail was forty seven Foot long, and
of a proportionable thickness. This Serpent, sprinkled with Mens Blood yet
warm, seem’d to prey upon a Marble Lyon: both these were inclos’d with a
Stone Rail, within which Malefactors were daily executed. Bloody Bows and
Arrows broke in small pieces lay between the Bones and dead Bodies. <i>Igniguez</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>call’d the King <i>Lazarus</i>, because he discover’d his Countrey on <i>St. Lazarus</i>’s

<p class='c010'>Making no long stay here, they return’d to their Ship, and weighing Anchor
Sail’d fifty Leagues more Westerly, the Fleet got sight of <i>Moscobo</i>, in the
Territory <i>Aguanil</i>, whose King assaulted the <i>Spaniards</i> with so much fury, that
two and twenty of them were slain, and scarce one escap’d which was not
wounded: wherefore they return’d with bad success to <i>Cuba</i>. Yet <i>Velasques</i>
no ways discourag’d thereat, not long after fitted out four Vessels, Manning
them with three hundred Men under the Command of <i>Juan Grisalva</i> and <i>Alamines</i>;
who having Sail’d seventy Leagues, discover’d the fruitful Island <i>Cosumella</i>;
along whose Shore stood fair Stone Edifices, intermix’d with Temples, whose
Steeples appear’d above the Houses. <i>Grisalva</i> being led up into one of these
Steeples by a Priest, saw at a distance off at Sea the Territory <i>Jucatan</i>: and in
the Place where they were, there were spacious Halls, full of Marble and Stone
Images of deformed Men and Beasts, which with a murmuring noise, and
burning of incense they religiously worship. The <i>Spaniards</i> call’d this Island
<i>Sancta Cruz</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Spaniards</i> fight with the <i>Campechiums</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Sailing from hence they directed their Course to <i>Campechium</i>, where the
year before they had been so civilly treated; where arriving, and without any
fear coming ashore, they found the <i>Campechiums</i> quite of another humor than
they were the former year, telling them, They would not suffer any Strangers
to be amongst them; and placing a burning Torch between theirs and the <i>Spanish</i>
Forces, threatned, That if they did not depart in quiet, they would force
them: which accordingly they endeavor’d, making a fierce Onset upon the
<i>Spaniards</i>; who being now come under their Battlements, when they saw their
advantage, pour’d what they had kept as a reserve, whole Volleys of small
Shot amongst them; which struck so much terror, that they all ran away,
shifting for themselves, and crowding into the City.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spaniards</i> found afterwards <i>Jucatan</i> to be but a <i>Peninsula</i>, and came before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>a River which fell with so strong a Current into the <i>Mexican Sea</i>, that it

whose Banks stood above six thousand <i>Americans</i>; and in the Water appear’d a
hundred Boats with Armed Men, which Row’d aboard the <i>Spanish</i> Ships.
The Interpreters of <i>Cuba</i>, whose Language agrees for the most part with the

<i>Grisalva</i>, and bartering with him, gave him as much Gold as his Iron

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sacrifice Island.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Soon after they Landed on the <i>Island of Sacrifice</i>, so call’d from the horrid

<div class='sidenote'>Exceeding horrible Sacrifices.</div>

<p class='c010'>Amongst other strange Images, there flood a great Lyon of Marble, seeming
almost decollated with a great gash; into which Wound they pour’d humane
Blood warm, which was receiv’d into a Stone Trough set for that purpose
underneath; then the Figure of a Man Carv’d in Alabaster, bowing forward,
as if looking into the Trough upon the Blood. Those which were
sacrificed were Prisoners taken on the neighboring Coasts, whom bringing
before their Idols, they ripping open make no farther inspection, but onely
to whip out the Heart; with which having smear’d the Lips of their Idols, they
throw it into the Fire: the Heads and Corps they let lie unburi’d; whose fleshy

<div class='sidenote'>Bishop <i>Casis</i> sad effect concerning the Pearl catching.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The Bishop <i>Bartholomew de Casis</i>, living a considerable time in <i>Hispaniola</i>,
in the City <i>Dominico</i>, being inform’d of the abundance of Pearls which
were caught before <i>Cubagua</i>, and the unsupportable cruelty of the <i>Spaniards</i>
there under <i>Ocampus</i>, us’d against the Inhabitants, went to <i>Spain</i>, with a design
to obtain of the Emperor <i>Charles the Fifth</i>, the Government over <i>Cumana</i> and
<i>Cubagua</i>, under pretence, to draw the ignorant Natives from their Idolatry, to
<i>Christianity</i>; which his request was especially promoted by <i>William</i> of <i>Nassaw</i>,
the Emperors prime Favorite; so that having his Letters Patents granted to
that purpose, he took Ship, and arriv’d with three hundred <i>Spanish</i> Gentlemen
of Quality in <i>Cumana</i>: And that they might have the greater respect shown to
them there, they had each a Red Cross given them, such as the Knights of
<i>Calatrava</i> generally wear. Yet little did <i>Ocampus</i>, the old Governor of <i>Cumana</i>,
regard either them or their Authority; for in stead of receiving and submitting,
he kept the Bishop <i>de Casis</i> out by force of Arms; who then made complaint
to the <i>Vice-Roy</i> of the <i>West-Indies</i> in <i>Hispaniola</i>, and in the mean time, put
his <i>Cargo</i> into a new Store-house.</p>

<p class='c010'>But whilst he made his Addresses, <i>Ocampus</i> having sufficiently inrich’d himself
departed, which incourag’d the <i>Cumaners</i>, who already were incens’d, and
weary of their former sufferings, to venture on a design, whereby they might
revenge themselves of the <i>Spaniards</i>, which their undertaking prov’d so successful,
that very few escap’d the Massacre: Of which, <i>de Casis</i> being inform’d,
and much discontented thereat, betook himself to a <i>Dominican</i> Cloyster in <i>Hispaniola</i>.</p>

days together, having at last utterly vanquish’d them, put to an ignominious

But the <i>Cubaguan Spaniards</i> unanimously withstood him; so that not being able

<div class='sidenote'><i>Magellanus</i> Expedition, how it happen’d.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>In the interim, while these scarce considerable Voyages turn’d to so small
account, <i>Ferdinand Magaglianus</i> (for so <i>Peter Martyr</i> calls him, and not <i>Magellanus</i>,
which herein deserves to be credited, because they were intimately acquainted,
and great friendship between them,) undertook to Sail round about
the World; the occasion of which we will here relate at large:</p>

<p class='c010'>This <i>Magaglianus</i>, or <i>Magellanus</i>, a Gentleman of <i>Portugal</i>, having perform’d
things of great importance for his King, in <i>Africa</i>, although with no less trouble
than Charge, desir’d an addition of half a Ducket a Moneth added to his
Annual Pension; an inconsiderable Sum to make a Request for, yet though so
little, was as niggardly deny’d: Whereupon, highly incensed, he study’d no
little revenge; to which effect, soon after an opportunity was presented, by
means of <i>Franciscus Serranus</i>, who writ from <i>Ternata</i> to him, that he should
speedily come thither, which he soon after did upon this account:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Giant.</div>

<p class='c010'>Pope <i>Alexander</i> the Sixth, having fixt Terminaries between the Kings of <i>Castile</i>
and <i>Portugal</i>, both busie at that time in discovering new Countreys, Order’d,
That <i>Castile</i> should possess all the Coasts lying to the West of the chief
<i>Meridian</i>, and <i>Portugal</i> to the East: By vertue of this partition, the rich Spicy
<i>Molucca</i> Islands fell absolutely to the <i>Portuguese</i>: Now <i>Magellanus</i> perswaded
<i>Charles the Fifth</i>, that they might be Sail’d to with a Westerly Course, and therefore
belong’d to <i>Castile</i>; Which advice, <i>Charles the Fifth</i> considering, and approving,
Rigg’d out five Ships, with which <i>Magellanus</i> set Sail from <i>Sevil</i>, the
tenth of <i>August, Anno 1519.</i> five Moneths he ply’d up and down the Coast inhabited
by the <i>Patagones</i>, where he found none but one single Person, or rather
a Monster, a Giant ten Foot high, who coming Aboard his Ship, devour’d
a great Hamper full of Biskets, and at one Draught drunk up nine Pottels of
Water. He also saw several Trees which had been Hew’n with Axes, and Crosses
made on the tops of them. Whilst he lay in that Harbor, which was call’d
<i>St. Julian</i>, he Cashier’d his Vice-Admiral, <i>John Carthagena</i>, with his Father Confessor,
and sparing their lives, set them ashore, and there left them to seek
their Fortunes, though they had Conspir’d to Murther him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>, how found.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Magellanus</i> from thence Sailing afterwards Southerly along <i>America</i>, to forty
two Degrees Southern Latitude, was engag’d with the eddyings of a very
strong Current, which driving one of the Ships into a Bay, split against a
blind Rock, but the Men being sav’d in their Boat, were driven farther and
farther into a Channel, between high and Snowy Mountains; whereupon he
immediately judg’d (as the famous Negromancer <i>Roderick Talerus</i> had often
told him) that there was the Passage, through which the Northern Ocean
flow’d into the Southern; wherefore he resolutely adventur’d to Sail into
those <i>Sraights</i>, which in some places narrow, and in others broad, is an hundred
and twenty Leagues long, and full of small Isles and dangerous Rocks.
Whilst he still Sail’d on, the Ship call’d <i>Antonio</i>, Tacking about, return’d to
<i>Cadiz</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>But <i>Magellanus</i> enter’d the great South-Sea with three Sail, on the 25. of <i>October</i>,
where the Sea-men suffer’d extremely by excessive Heat, Drought, and Famine,
three Moneths and twenty Days, without sight of Land: And now,
their Shooes, and the Leather which cover’d their Shields, began also to grow
scarce (which before had been counted a Dainty) when they discover’d two
Islands lying two hundred Leagues distance one from another, yet both Desolate
and Barren, wherefore they were call’d the <i>Unfortunate Isles</i>: After that,
they came amongst a great number of Islands, whose Inhabitants were much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>inclin’d to Thievery; for which cause they Denominated them <i>Ladrones</i>, the
chiefest Island call’d <i>Borneo</i>, hath two hundred fifty four Leagues in Circumference,
whereon a Tree grows, whose Leaves when faln off, seem to be alive
and creep like Worms. The King of this Island entertain’d the <i>Spaniards</i> very
courteously, two Elephants bringing his Presents to them on the Shore, out of
a City consisting of twenty thousand Houses.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Magellanus</i> slain.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Spaniards</i> murdered.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>An end of the Voyage about the world.</div>

<p class='c010'>Near <i>Borneo</i> are two lesser Islands, call’d, <i>Zubo</i> and <i>Matan</i>; The King of <i>Zubo</i> freely
submitted himself to the <i>Spaniards</i>, and <i>Magellanus</i> leaving his Fleet at Anchor
in the Haven, went with his own and other  <i>Indian</i> Boats, and attended with some
of the <i>Zubensers</i> to <i>Matan</i>, where setting a Village on Fire, he carry’d great Riches
from thence: This not satisfying, he resolv’d within eight days to set upon
the Royal Head-City; but the King in his own Defence, Encountering with
<i>Magellanus</i>, slew him, and seven <i>Spaniards</i> more, besides twenty two dangerously
wounded; those which escap’d by flight, got to <i>Zubo</i>, where being invited to
Dinner by the King, they were all of them (in stead of a second Course) Murther’d
at Table. The occasion of this was out of Revenge, because the <i>Spaniards</i>
had fall’n too foul upon their Women and Maids, Devirginating, and forcing
them to their Pleasure, than which rudeness nothing was among them more
Detestable. The Sea-men weakned by these Misfortunes, were necessitated to
burn their third Ship, call’d, <i>St. Jago</i>; but Sailing to the <i>Molucco</i> Islands with
the other two, they Freighted them both with Cloves; with which the Ship <i>Trinitas</i>
Sail’d to <i>New-Spain</i> through the South-Sea, and the <i>Victoria</i>, Commanded
by <i>John Sebastian de Lano</i> went the same way which the <i>Portuguese</i> us’d, and so to
St. <i>Lucar de Barrameda</i>, near <i>Sivile</i>, where he came to Anchor with his Ship and
eighteen Men.</p>

Front routed, and the Rear terrifi’d with the noise and smoke of the Guns, they
also broke, being at the same instant Charg’d with the Horse, which were so
terrible to them that never saw Horses, nor such Service on Horseback before,
that in a short time the whole Body of so great an Army was utterly dissipated,
and the triumphing Conquerors took possession of the empty City <i>Potanchanum</i>,
where Solacing, they staid a whole Moneth. Then from hence they Sail’d to
<i>Colvaca</i>, where, upon the request of the Natives, they settled a Colony. Amongst
the Presents which were there given to the <i>Spaniards</i>, were some of their
own Volumes, Books, whose Leaves were made of the innermost Rind of a
Tree, and a kind of Paste, made of their Meal, glew’d together; the Characters
stood at some distance one after another, rang’d like our <i>Christ-Cross Row</i>,
or <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here <i>Cortez</i> was amaz’d to behold their stately Temples, the Floors whereof
were cover’d with Embroyder’d Tapestry, beset with Precious Stones, to
which great multitudes flock’d, being very zealous to perform their Devotions.</p>

<p class='c010'>When their Seed is put into the Ground, or come to its full growth, they offer
young Children to their <i>Zemez</i>, richly Cloth’d, having been fatten’d some
Weeks before: When they want Children they kill their Slaves, and in default
of them, they pacifie them with Dogs.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Sacrifices.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Victims</i> that go to be Sacrific’d, they Worship with all Adoration, Bowing
and Congying before them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Idol-Worship.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Zeal in this their Idol-Worship may appear from a strange Custom,
observ’d by them when they enter their Temple, <i>viz.</i> they either draw Blood
out of their Tongues, Lips, Ears, Breast, Knees, or Palm of their Hands, which
they throw into the Air, supposing thereby to be pardon’d by their indulgent
Gods.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Zempoal</i>, a City.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the City <i>Zempoal</i>, <i>Cortez</i> found five Slaves, who being kept close Prisoners,
were to be Sacrific’d the next day; but he releasing them, did upon the
importunate request of the <i>Quines</i>, or Priests, and promises of great ransoms,
and their telling of him that the <i>Zemez</i> would spoil all their Seed and Plants
that year, if they did not go on with these Offerings, restor’d the Prisoners
again; who, though the enjoyments of all happinesses in the other World were
promis’d them by their Priest, and great assurance given thereof; yet they
were not forward, but return’d, unwilling to suffer, though by so gainful a Sacrifice.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Zemez</i> wonderful Idols.</div>

<p class='c010'>At the <i>Zemez</i> Feet hung abundance of Mens Bones bundled up together, and
under them were Written the Names of their Enemies, whose Flesh had been
either Sacrific’d or eaten.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cortez</i> his Exploits.</div>

<p class='c010'>Twelve Leagues beyond <i>Zempoal</i>, <i>Cortez</i> built a new City near the River
<i>Grisalva</i>, and call’d it <i>Vera Crux</i>, which <i>Diego Velasques</i> resented so ill, it being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>done without his knowledge, that he petition’d the Council of <i>Cuba</i> to give Sentence
of Death against the Founder: But whilst <i>Cortez</i> expected an answer
from the Embassadors (which were sent to the <i>Spanish</i> Court to give account
of the necessity of building a City there) he travell’d eighty Leagues Westerly.
The <i>Zempoalensers</i> accompanied him in great Troops, hoping by that means
to shake off the yoke of the mighty King <i>Montezuma</i>, against whom they were
then design’d. <i>Cortez</i> coming into the Territory of <i>Sincuchimalar</i>, was in the
Name of <i>Montezuma</i>, by one of his Princes, courteously entertain’d in a great
Village, scituate on a steep Mountain, without any Path or Way leading to it,
but by two high Ladders. <i>Sincuchimalar</i> lies surrounded with Hills, whose
tops seem to touch the Clouds. Coming down from the Village, they travell’d
through a barren and cold Valley, where they suffer’d such great Inconveniences
by want of Provisions and Water, and exceeding coldness of the
Weather, that many of them perish’d. After that, they ascended a pleasant
Hill, on whose summit stood a Chappel, with a handsom Steeple, and hedg’d
about with great heaps of Wood, brought thither by the Inhabitants for the
use of their Sacrifices. At the foot of this Mountain was a fruitful Valley
water’d by a pleasant River, on whose Banks a certain Prince nam’d <i>Cacataminus</i>
had a Palace, built of Stone, and containing many Rooms, and convenient
Lodgings. Somewhat higher to the Land, appear’d more of the like Structures,
which were all under <i>Montezuma</i>’s Jurisdiction; but the neighboring
Countrey <i>Tlaxcalla</i>, whose Inhabitants were famous for their Valor, would
never receive any Laws from <i>Montezuma</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable War in <i>Tlaxcalla</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Cortez</i> no sooner set footing in this Countrey, but he was set upon by a thousand
of the Inhabitants, who at the first Assault kill’d two of the <i>Spanish</i> Horse,
yet after this bold Charge, the Assailants fled, and on the next day desir’d
Peace; whereupon the <i>Spaniards</i> march’d quietly into the Countrey, when a
confus’d Company, or Forlorn-Hope, making a horrible Noise, set upon them;
but after a slight Skirmish, they fled to their Main Body, which immediately
drawing up, being at least a hundred thousand, hemm’d in the handful of <i>Spaniards</i>,
and so were ready to swallow them, leaving them no Angle to escape at.
Thus invironed, they were assailed on every side, fighting till Sun-set, and
had undoubtedly been utterly destroy’d, had not <i>Cortez</i> ply’d his six Pieces of
Cannon, discharging continually Volley after Volley upon them; and though
the Execution was very much, yet the Sound and report of their Ordinance
was more terrible to them that were out of the reach of the Bullet, and made
more to the gaining so great a Victory, Fear conquering more than Slaughter;
so that by the Evening, despairing either of their Safety or better Fortune, the
whole Army disbanding fled: But the pursuing Conquerors firing five of
their Villages, remain’d Masters of the Field; yet they, though thus totally
routed, taking fresh Courage (a wonderful thing!) reinforc’d them, and set
upon the <i>Spanish</i> Camp, with no less than 150000 Fighting Men: Yet notwithstanding
so vast an Army, <i>Cortez</i> so well order’d his small parcel of Men,
and so valiantly led on upon all Advantages, that he in like manner defeated
this, as they thought, Invincible Preparation. Thus flesh’d with so much Blood
of the Natives, he raged every where, giving no Quarter where-ever he
went.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mean while <i>Quesitangal</i>, a neighboring Prince, having also raised an Army
with which he design’d, being assisted by darkness, craftily to fall into the <i>Spanish</i>
Quarters by Night, subtilly dissembling, sent Embassadors the day before,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>with several Presents, and Overtures of Peace, which indeed were onely
Spies, to take notice where they might best break in upon them; which <i>Cortez</i>
mistrusting, and soon being inform’d of the whole Design, he cut off the
Spies Hands, so sending them back to <i>Quesitangal</i> with Defiance: Hereupon the
<i>Indians</i> immediately setting forward, took advantage of the ensuing Night,
and with great fury fell upon the <i>Spaniards</i>, who preacquainted with the Design,
were in so good a posture to receive them, that not able to endure such
hot Service, they quickly retreated, and utterly gave over the Enterprize: But
<i>Cortez</i> as much encourag’d by these Victories, pursu’d them, and the same
Night Storm’d <i>Tlaxcalla</i>, a City containing above twenty thousand Houses,
which in few Hours he carried. This City was curiously built, of bak’d
Stones, and a place of great Trade; insomuch that the Market-places swarm’d
with Buyers and Sellers, bartering one with another all manner of Provisions,
as Fish, Flesh, and Bread, also Plumes of Feathers, Pearls, imbroyder’d
Tapestry, Chalk, Stones, Timber, and Herbs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Twenty days <i>Cortez</i> staid here to refresh his Army, and then march’d to the
neighboring City <i>Chiurutical</i>, with the Auxiliary Forces of the <i>Tlaxcallans</i>, to
the number of above a hundred thousand; they told him, That the People of
<i>Chiurutical</i> had barricado’d up their Streets, laid upon the tops of their Houses
great heaps of Stones, that their upper Rooms were cramm’d with Archers,
and all things made ready both for Offence and Defence; which Advertisement
he not much hearkned to, because he was conducted into the City with all their
State-Formalities of Singing and Tabering upon their <i>Tamboes</i>, and every where
courteously entertain’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Plot strangely discover’d.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Martial Affairs.</div>

<p class='c010'>Mean while <i>Montezuma</i> had rais’d a great Army, which were in their advance,
not onely to the defence of his Border, but to surprize them while
they staid in that City, the Townsmen having invited him thither to their rescue
and his own defence, had not the Plot been accidentally discover’d by a
<i>Chirutecan</i> Woman, who giving advice to one of her Friends that follow’d <i>Cortez</i>,
that he should immediately make his escape, because that all the Strangers
would be destroy’d within few Hours, who came and inform’d <i>Cortez</i> thereof;
whereupon he desir’d all the Magistrates of the City to come and speak
with him, who no sooner entred the Hall where he was, but his Men by
Command immediately shot them to death, which terrible Rumor spreading,
and alarm’d with the report of the Executing Musquets, the City was suddenly
in an Uproar, gathering thither Arm’d from all Places, and began a sharp
Conflict, which lasted five Hours; but then wearied out, and despairing of
Success, loosing their Courage, they desir’d a Cessation, and at last concluded
Peace with the <i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Now <i>Mexico</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>This News of his discover’d Intention, so startled <i>Montezuma</i>, that he suppos’d
it better to desist, and procure the Favor of <i>Cortez</i> by Presents; wherefore
he sent him 15000 Cotton Habits, trim’d up very richly, ten great Chargers
of Gold, and some Vessels of Wine, desiring him for a while to forbear
his Intentions of marching to <i>Tenustitan</i> his Chief City, and that he would in
the mean while treat with him for an Accommodation. But <i>Cortez</i>, though
he accepted of the Presents, yet nevertheless held his Resolution of marching
on.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Wonderful Mountain <i>Popocatepeque</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Resolution of two <i>Spaniards</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Eight Leagues from <i>Tenustitan</i> he saw the double-spired Mountain <i>Popocatepeque</i>,
so call’d from the Smoke which continually ascends from its top; for
<i>Popoca</i> signifies <i>A Smoke</i>, and <i>Tepeque, A Mountain</i>. The Smoke rises upright, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>with so much strength, that by the greatest Wind it deviates not one jot from
mounting upwards in a direct Line, to whose forked Head ten <i>Spaniards</i> resolv’d
to climb; but having got scarce half way up, they were forc’d to return,
the Ashes lying knee-deep; yet at last two more resolute conquer’d all
those Difficulties, and got to the top, where the mouth of the Cave, as they
guessed, measur’d four Miles in Circumference: The shaking of the Mountain,
and roaring of the Flames, frequently bursting forth, so much terrified
them, that they staid not long there; for, as we said, the Ground not onely
trembled under them, but the Fiery Gulph ejected great Stones, which falling
down on all sides of the Mountain, rolled to the bottom; and without doubt
they had there perish’d, had they not speedily run to a hollow neighboring
Hill, from whence they came at length to the rest of their Company, where
they were admir’d by the <i>Indians</i> for their undaunted Resolution, and presented
with several rich Gifts. These <i>Indians</i> had a Tradition, That for wicked
Princes, and such as had not govern’d the People well, this was the <i>Tophet</i> appointed
for their Torments.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Cities in <i>America</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>A very strange Cawse-way.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Cortez</i> being got through the poor Territory of the <i>Guazazingers</i>, and having
suffer’d great Cold upon the Mountains, discover’d <i>Amaquameca</i>, the chief City
of the Province <i>Chialco</i>, seated in a great Lake, to which he row’d in a kind of
Boats, by the Inhabitants call’d <i>Acales</i>. Passing from thence, he was courteously
receiv’d in <i>Iztapalapa</i>, another City, which boasts above eight thousand
Stone Buildings, besides admirable Palaces, with spacious Rooms, delightful
Gardens, and Ponds full of Fish, and almost cover’d with Fowl; from whence
a Wall or Cawse-way of a great breadth, that cross’d over both Land and Water,
led from <i>Iztapalapa</i> to <i>Tenustitan</i>. This Cawse-way hath many Bridges,
which are drawn up in time of War, under which the Water runs out of a
Salt Lake into a Fresh, that ebbs and flows, although lying between high
Mountains, and seventy Leagues from the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>On both sides this Wall, being ten Leagues in length, appears three great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Towns,  <i>viz.</i> <i>Mesiqualisingo</i>, <i>Colvacana</i>, and <i>Vuichilabusco</i>, all Populous, and well-built.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How they make Salt.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Colvacana</i> is supplied by the Salt Lake, to its no small benefit and inriching;
for the Water being by Pipes convey’d into the City, in all the Places and Cisterns
for its reception makes a Scum, which being coagulated by the Sun, and
after boyl’d, becomes Salt, with which they drive a great Trade; for no Salt
being to be had in any place but here, all Foreign Merchants come thither for
Supply.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable Passage of King <i>Montezuma</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Cortez</i> being in his March within a League and a half of <i>Tenustitan</i>, <i>Montezuma</i>,
preceded with a thousand of his Nobless, came to meet and salute him,
all of them rather like Pilgrims, bare-footed, and congying, kissing their right
Hands, with which they first kiss’d the Ground: After them appear’d <i>Montezuma</i>
himself, who put a Chain of Gold, imboss’d with Pearls, about <i>Cortez</i>
his Neck, and immediately conducted him to the City, where having entred,
and being come into the Palace, <i>Montezuma</i> plac’d <i>Cortez</i> on a Golden Throne,
and surrendred up his Right to his Catholick Majesty of <i>Spain</i>, in the presence
of all his Peers, to their no small amazement.</p>

<p class='c010'>But whilst all things had a good face, and went on thus fairly beyond their
expectations, <i>Cortez</i> was inform’d, That King <i>Coalcopoca</i> had a Design on the
new City <i>Vera Crux</i>, and had treacherously murder’d two of the Garrison,
and wounded two more: Whereupon <i>Cortez</i> having such fair beginnings, who
had swallow’d already in his Hopes the whole Empire and Wealth belonging
to <i>Montezuma</i>, laid hold of this Occasion, pretending Treason, and breach of
Contract; wherefore he put <i>Montezuma</i> under Custody, notwithstanding he
had clear’d himself of the Conspiracy, by bringing <i>Coalcopoca</i>, with his Sons,
and fifteen of his Peers, Prisoners to <i>Tenustitan</i>, who by the command of <i>Cortez</i>
suffer’d a lingering death, being all burnt with Green Wood. But in vain
did <i>Montezuma</i> think to reconcile himself with <i>Cortez</i>, since all he did could
render no manner of satisfaction; however he continu’d to oblige him by
fresh Favors, whose Relation we will be more particular in, as meriting the
same.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span><i>Montezuma</i>’s Grandees seem’d to be much discontented, because he had without
the least resistance or consideration setled a handful of Strangers to domineer
over his whole Dominions, by which his weakness and pusillanimity, he
was now a Prisoner, like a common Malefactor, who had formerly govern’d
so mighty Territories. Amongst several Princes which seem’d thus to be
concern’d, was <i>Catumazin</i> Governor of the Province <i>Hacolvacan</i> who had he
not been surpriz’d and attaqu’d the Night before by the information and discovery
of <i>Montezuma</i> himself, he would have hazarded the ruine of all
<i>Cortez</i> his Successes: But now Fortune still daily more smil’d, giving wonderful
Advantages to the <i>Spaniards</i>; Silver and Gold continually flowing
like Rivers from all Quarters, that their onely trouble and puzzle
was where and how to dispose it: but yet for all this, they were not free
from jealousie, that <i>Montezuma</i>’s Forces might swallow theirs, though he
was secur’d; of which you may judge by the vastness of his Imperial City
<i>Tenustitan</i>, seated in the Province of <i>Mexico</i>, where a Salt Lake mixes its Waters
with a fresh River, both which in circumference contain, as we said, seventy
Leagues, and distant from the Main Land five or six Miles; the Water
about it continually cover’d with small Boats rowing up and down. It hath
four Stone, besides DrawBridges in several Places, and strengthned with
Gates no less artificial than costly, which lead from the City to the Main Land.
The Fresh Water is convey’d through the Salt in a Wall’d Channel, out of
which none may take up Water, except they pay Excise to the Kings Farmers.
This City boasts above sixty thousand Houses, all divided into Islands, but
joyn’d with great Wooden Bridges: The Market-place surrounded with Galleries,
drives a quick and constant Trade, being always full of Buyers and Sellers.
In every Street they have a publick Inn, in each of which they keep Ordinaries,
wherein the Tables are stor’d with well-dress’d Flesh and Fish, not
wanting plenty of Wine. Their Trades are divided into several Companies,
and they have their peculiar Places to dwell in. They deal very much in <i>Cacaos</i>,
a Fruit not unlike an Almond, which beaten to Powder, and prepar’d
with several other Ingredients, gives name to that excellent Drink now in use
with us, call’d <i>Chocolate</i>: They grow onely on moist and warm Grounds, and
are us’d so currently in Trade, that they go in stead of Money. Amongst many
beautiful Edifices, their Guild is very magnificent, wherein twelve Judges,
attended by a considerable number of Officers and Servants, sit daily, hearing
and determining all manner of Causes. The next is their Chief Temple or
Minster, built quadrangular, all of Free-Stone, having four Portals, opening
into the four principal Streets or Triumphs, that end at the four Stone Bridges.
On the Walls, being of an exceeding height, stand several Turrets, so high,
that they seem to hide their Spires in the Clouds; and have Apartments,
wherein the Priests Diet, Lodge, and Study, which are ascended by Marble
Steps. These Religious Persons are generally of Noble Extract, which at seven
years old are carried thither, where leading a very strict Life, they never
come forth to see the World, till they enter the State of Matrimony. The famous
<i>Colossus</i>, that stood over the <i>Rhodian</i> Haven, between whose Legs all Ships
did Sail, that came in or went out of the Harbor, cannot stand in competition
with the stupendious Idol <i>Vuichilabuchichi</i>, whose Head touches the Arch’d Ceiling
of the high Temple. Near his stand several lesser Images, made of Meal
and all sorts of Herbs bak’d together, and kneaded with Mens Blood. Along
the Walls are exceeding dark Vaults, in which the Priests onely walk; over
them are large Halls, full of Presentations of their Gods, which serve for the
Burying-places of their Kings.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whilst <i>Cortez</i> and <i>Montezuma</i> were viewing the Temple, two <i>Spaniards</i> rush’d
suddenly into one of the Cells, where they found abundance of Lamps and
Torches burning, and the Walls bedaub’d two Inches thick with Humane
Gore: Over-head hung vast numbers of their Sacrificing Knives; and the
stench of the place was intollerable.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Grandeur of the Kings in <i>Tenustitan</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Garden-houses.</div>

<p class='c010'>But <i>Cortez</i> going on, <i>Montezuma</i> and his Attendants resented it very hainously,
that he pull’d down some of their Idols, and durst presume to look in the
Kings Face; for those People bear so great Reverence to their Kings, that
none dares so much as once look up in their presence: His Council stand bare-footed,
stooping with their Faces bow’d almost to the Ground before him:
Four times a day they change their Apparel; and a Suit which they have once
worn, is put to no other use, but presented to such Soldiers as have done some
eminent Service. Whatever manner of Chargers, Dishes, Pots, Cups, and
other Vessels the Emperor is serv’d in at his Table, are every Meal new. The
King hath in <i>Tenustitan</i> three great Structures, whose Magnificence, for Cost and
rare Architecture, can hardly be parallell’d. The first is the Residence for all
deform’d People: The second, an <i>Aviary</i> for all manner of Birds and Fowl,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>being a spacious open place, Roof’d with Nets, and surrounded with Marble
Galleries. The third, being a Den for Wild Beasts, was divided into several
Rooms, wherein were kept Lions, Tygers, Wolves, Foxes, and all manner of
Four-footed Animals.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable Exploits of <i>Cortez</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Tenustitan</i>, or <i>Mexico</i>, taken.</div>

<p class='c010'>But whilst <i>Cortez</i> having staid waiting eight Months in <i>Tenustitan</i>, for the
return of the Messengers sent to the <i>Spanish</i> Court, receiv’d Tidings, That <i>Pamphilo
Narvaecy</i>, by order of <i>Velasques</i>, was come with eighteen Sail, Mann’d with
eight hundred Foot, and eighty Horse, from <i>Cuba</i>, and now riding before the
<i>Mexican</i> Coast; from whence soon after he receiv’d unexpected Command, to
come presently aboard unarm’d, and resign up his Authority: But he in stead
of submission, compell’d <i>Narvaecy</i> in a short time to relinquish his Title, and
own him for Superior. Mean while the <i>Spaniards</i> which remain’d in possession
of <i>Tenustitan</i>, ran the hazard of a general Massacre; for the Citizens much
stomacking the Oppressions of the <i>Spaniards</i>, who grew very insolent, inslaving
their King, bringing their inveterate Enemies the <i>Tlaxcallans</i> and <i>Guazuzingans</i>
into their City, exacting them to pay Tributes, pulling down their Gods, and
demolishing their ancient Idols, they brake out from all Parts in a tumultuous
manner, ran to Arms, and besieg’d them Day and Night in their Fort, although
<i>Montezuma</i> endeavor’d to perswade the contrary. <i>Cortez</i>, hearing of it,
came to their relief with the New Forces Landed from <i>Cuba</i>; but he fighting
his way ere he could get in, was so roughly entertain’d by the <i>Mexicans</i>, that
they kill’d him forty Men, wounding as many more; and notwithstanding
fifteen Field-pieces with continual Shot made foul Breaches, lessening the
number of the Assailants, yet they suddenly fill’d up their Vacancies again
with fresh Men, which clamber’d over the Heaps of those that lay slain.
Three Days the Battel had continu’d very fierce, when <i>Montezuma</i> being with
the <i>Spaniards</i> in the Castle, went to a low Window, to see if he could command
his Subjects to retreat; but a continual Cry so deafned their Ears, and
showres of Arrows and Stones so took away their sight, that he did nothing:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Then <i>Montezuma</i>, thinking to be more easily either heard or seen, went to a
higher Window, where looking out, he was unfortunately hit with a Stone,
of which he died three days after. Besides their Enemies, the <i>Spaniards</i> suffer’d
extremely by Famine; and though they had beaten down a Tower, which
had done the Castle great mischief, and set five hundred Houses on fire, yet
they could discern no likely issue thereof, but judg’d it best to make their
escape by Night over the nearest Bridge: <i>Cortez</i> therefore dividing his gotten
Treasures, which amounted to above seven hundred thousand Duckets,
amongst his Soldiers, carried <i>Montezuma</i>’s Son, and two Daughters, Prisoners
with him, though not without infinite danger and loss; for the <i>Tenustitans</i> assail’d
him on both sides, and falling in also upon his Rear, spar’d not to kill
<i>Montezuma</i>’s own Children. In this last Fight the Service was so hot, that <i>Cortez</i>
lost forty two Horse, a hundred and fifty <i>Spaniards</i>, and two thousand Auxiliaries;
and although gotten over the Lake, they were still pursu’d by the
<i>Mexicans</i>, who would then undoubtedly have made a general Slaughter, had
not <i>Cortez</i> amused the Enemies, by leaving in the Night great Fires in several
Places, his suppos’d Camps, whilst he silently stole away: Yet the <i>Tenustitans</i>
would have pursu’d the <i>Spaniards</i>, had they not wanted Provisions: But <i>Cortez</i>
sending his Treasure before him, through the Countrey <i>Colva</i>, to <i>Vera Crux</i>,
with a Convoy of five Horse, and forty four Foot, were all cut off by the <i>Colvaans</i>,
and feasted upon in a Thanksgiving Sacrifice. The same misfortune befel
twelve <i>Spaniards</i> in <i>Tepeacu</i>, which great City surrendred it self up to <i>Cortez</i>,
being assisted by a mighty Army of <i>Tlaxcallans</i> and others. But after all
these Losses, he took  <i>Guaccachiulla</i>, and <i>Izzuca</i>, both fortified with strong Walls
and Gates; in which last he burnt above a hundred Temples, built for Humane
Sacrifices. All the Countrey through which he thus ransack’d, he call’d
<i>New-Spain</i>. From the City <i>Tazuco</i>, which he had newly taken, intending to
besiege <i>Tenustitan</i>, he digg’d through the Lakes a broad Trench, of above three
Leagues in length, to bring up thirteen new Ships to <i>Tenustitan</i>; and the
neighboring People envying, that that City should not be conquer’d, as well
as theirs, rais’d an Army of above a hundred and fifty thousand Men, making
<i>Cortez</i> their General: Himself incamped on one corner of the City, appointing
the other two sides to be invested by <i>Gonsales Sandovalo</i>, and <i>Pedro Avarado</i>;
but the Besieg’d resolutely broke out, and made a fierce Sally with five thousand
Boats, setting upon the thirteen Ships; but the great Guns made such execution
and havock amongst them, that they retreated with great damage.
Whoever were taken Prisoners in this Fight by the <i>Spaniards</i>, the <i>Tlaxcallans</i>,
being Commission’d by <i>Cortez</i>, feasted upon. On the seventh day the City
was taken, but not without great Slaughter, and the new King imprison’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sad accident occasion’d by a <i>Tyger</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>After this mighty Conquest, <i>Cortez</i> resolv’d to discover those Territories
that lay Southward; and whilst he was making all things ready for the Voyage,
he sent two Ships with an invaluable Treasure to <i>Spain</i>, who fearing
to be taken by the <i>French</i> Pyrats, ran in at <i>Tercera</i>, where a miserable Accident
hapned to the Seamen of the biggest Ship, wherein were carried two Tygers,
which though taken young, and bred up amongst men, yet had not so quite
forgotten their natural ferocity, but that one breaking loose in the Night, tore
seven of them in pieces, hurting a far greater number, of which some had the
Brawns of their Arms, the Calves of their Legs, and fleshy parts of their
Thighs bit out.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Battel with Baboons.</div>

<p class='c010'>Several Places in <i>America</i> breed Tygers, that far exceed Lyons in fierceness;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>so that where any considerable number of them frequents, though the Soil be
never so fruitful, yet it is left desolate and forsaken. But the Baboons that
frequent the Woods are more pleasant, and less dangerous. <i>Peter Arias</i> relates,
That his whole Army incountred with these Beasts, which climb’d from one
Tree to the other, shrieking, and making very strange Gesticulations to those
that were gone before, and gathering their Mouths and Hands full of Stones,
which they threw as exact and strongly as a Man. When one of these
Baboons, shot by a Musquet, fell to the Ground, the rest gave such a horrible
shriek, that the Woods resounding with the noise, strook a terror into the <i>Spaniards</i>.
Amongst several things that hapned in this Counter-scuffle, take this
one: A <i>Spaniard</i> taking aim with his Musquet at an old Baboon, which sate
pearch’d up in a Tree, and being now just ready to give Fire, the Baboon Soldier,
at the very instant, to break the Shot, taking a Stone out of his Mouth,
threw it exactly into the Mans Mouth, with such force as beat out some of his
Teeth; with which sudden blow surpris’d, he lost his Mark; and the proud
Foe, shewing signs of Triumph, went his way.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Great destruction.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The unfortunate Expedition of <i>Garajus</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Spaniards</i> rosted.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cortez</i> his Ambition.</div>

<p class='c010'>But whilst <i>Cortez</i> staid in the Countrey of <i>Tenustitan</i> (now call’d <i>Mexico</i>)
<i>Franciscus Garajus</i> sail’d out of the Haven of <i>Jamaica</i>, with eleven Ships, to the
River <i>Panucus</i>, there, according to the Command of the Emperor <i>Charles</i>, to
plant a Colony: Whereupon he went ashore, ordering his Fleet to sail along
in sight of Land: So wading through the River <i>Montaltus</i>, which glides between
high Mountains, he came to a Morassy Ground, in which he and they
often sunk almost up to the Middle, and lost his way in a Thicket of young
Trees; yet at last being come to the River <i>Panucus</i>, he found several high
Walls, being the Ruines of Fortresses, Temples, and Towers, destroy’d by
<i>Cortez</i>; so that the City lay quite desolate. Twenty Leagues further, upon
the Banks of the same River, <i>Cortez</i> had in like manner sack’d and destroy’d
<i>Chiglia</i>, a Town which before its burning reckon’d above twenty thousand
Houses, besides many fair Palaces, Walls, Towers, and Temples: Which Cruelties
and Spoil had bred so great an <i>Odium</i> in the Inhabitants against the <i>Spaniards</i>,
that they immediately sent an Army against <i>Garajus</i>, who had only a few
half-starv’d Men with him; yet he receiv’d the Enemy twice in his Retreat
to the new Colony <i>St. Steven</i>, rais’d out of <i>Chiglia</i>’s Ruines; but finding no
Provisions where-ever he came, he judg’d it fittest to send his Horse into the
Countrey to Forage; which <i>Cortez</i> meeting, took Prisoners, under pretence
that <i>Garajus</i> came to take Possession, where he had neither Authority nor Right.
<i>Cortez</i> also made himself Master of <i>Garajus</i> Ship and Fleet, commanding him
withal to appear in <i>Tenustitan</i>, which not knowing how to avoid, he obey’d:
His People mean time ranging up and down without a Head or Commander,
either died by Famine, or were murther’d and eaten by the Natives; for at one
time the <i>Americans</i> made a general Feast with two hundred and fifty rosted <i>Spaniards</i>:
But their days of Triumph lasted not long; for <i>Sandovalus</i>, one of <i>Cortez</i>
his Prime Officers, set with so much fury upon those <i>Cannibals</i>, that he kill’d
several thousands of them, and burnt sixty Persons of Prime Quality, all Commanders,
in the sight of their Friends and Relations. But <i>Garajus</i>, whose Son
was married to <i>Cortez</i> his Daughter, liv’d not long after the Wedding, which
occasion’d a murmur as if <i>Cortez</i> had poyson’d him, to rid himself of a Partner
in his Government; for it had been generally observ’d, that his Ambition suffer’d
no Equal. The <i>Americans</i> fell all down before him; all were Servants
alike: The Court which he kept swarm’d with Attendance, on which he spent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>vast Sums of Money; yet his Incomes were able to bear such excessive Disbursements.
He kept in constant Pay five thousand Soldiers, and several Ships
ready rigg’d and prepar’d on all occasions, to hold in awe the enslav’d People,
or else for the Discovery of New Countreys: Yet after all these extraordinary
Charges defray’d, to shew his Wealth and Greatness, he caus’d a Piece of
Cannon to be cast all of massie Gold: for the Kings which formerly acknowledg’d
<i>Montezuma</i> for their Sovereign, gave him a yearly Revenue, most of
which were valu’d to be worth twenty three Tun of Gold; for so much the
King of <i>Tescuscus</i>, a stately City, paid, whose Houses Plaister’d with White-Lime,
seem’d afar off to be rather a Chalky Hill or Mountain, cover’d with
Snow: Full as much did the King pay which reigned in <i>Otumba</i>, notwithstanding
he had receiv’d with his <i>Christianity</i> the Name of <i>Ferdinand Cortez</i>; yet
others gave less: The King <i>Guacinalgo</i>, with his Mother, and some Slaves,
bringing Gold, came to present it to <i>Cortez</i>; and entring the Palace, through
a Guard of five hundred Horse and four Hundred Foot, which were always
ready Arm’d for fear of Insurrections, he fell down prostrate on the Ground.
Thus all things even out-went whatever he could desire, hope for, or imagine.
And <i>Alvaredo</i>, one of his Commanders, being sent Eastwardly, brought great
Treasures back with him, which the conquer’d Kings were forc’d to raise.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>His Misfortunes.</div>

<p class='c010'>But Fortune, who seldom continues her Favors long, at last began to frown;
for <i>Cortez</i> having sent an unvaluable Treasure of Gold and Pearls to the Emperor
<i>Charles</i> the Fifth, <i>Floryn</i> the <i>French</i> Pyrate met with and took it, which
went so much to his Heart, that for a considerable time he sent no Advice to
the <i>Spanish</i> Court, which made them grow jealous of him, doubting that he
intended to make himself King over <i>New-Spain</i>; and this Suspicion was not a
little augmented by his Enemies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Plot of two <i>Spanish</i> Officers.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the Neck of these, follow’d another Misfortune; for <i>Christopher Olitus</i>,
sent out by <i>Cortez</i> to discover new Countreys, rebelling, took up Arms against
him, being then in the Haven <i>Figueras</i>, five hundred Leagues beyond. Notwithstanding
the <i>Spaniards</i>, although amongst a new-conquer’d People, which
without doubt long’d for Revenge, were not to take notice of their danger,
but to go on with undaunted Resolution; whereupon <i>Cortez</i> drawing out a
strong Party, march’d a long and troublesom way to meet <i>Olitus</i>, making great
Slaughters where-ever he came. <i>Francisco de las Casas</i> was commanded to go
upon the same Account by Sea, and arriving first, found him setling his new
Colony, which he nam’d <i>Triumph de Sancta Crux</i>; and notwithstanding the
Water with a Northerly Wind was very rough and boysterous in the Haven
<i>Figueras</i> (which the <i>Spaniards</i> call’d so, because they found Trees there, which
growing at the Foot of the Mountains, bore a Fruit not unlike a Fig) yet they
came to a present Engagement, wherein <i>Casas</i> worsting <i>Olitus</i>, having sunk one
of his Ships, stood out again to Sea; but surpriz’d by a violent Storm, and
driven on the Shore, fell into <i>Olitus</i>’s Hands, who had a little before also taken
<i>Egidíus</i> or <i>Giles Gonsales</i>. These two Prisoners consulted together how they
might poyson or murder <i>Olitus</i>, which fell out according to their desires, because
the Servants of the House where they lodg’d sided with them; so taking
hold of the first opportunity, as they were at Supper together, they stabb’d
him with their Knives in several places; yet the Wounds were not so great or
mortal, but that he retain’d strength to escape in the dark to a neighboring
Hut; but the Assassinates immediately sent out Messengers, publishing, That he
who did not, knowing where <i>Olitus</i> was immediately bring him to them, should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>receive condign punishment; which terrifying <i>Olitus</i>, he discover’d himself,
and was immediately beheaded.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Mexicans</i> Apparel.</div>

<p class='c010'>During the time that the <i>Spanish</i> Officers had these Civil Broyls one against
another, <i>Lodowick Pontæus</i>, a Man well experienc’d in the Law, came from <i>Spain</i>
to <i>America</i>, there in the Emperors Name to settle all things in good order; having
also particular Instructions, to shew great kindness to <i>Cortez</i>, and to make
him a Knight of the Order of <i>St. James</i>, that by that means the Emperor might
be the more esteem’d for his Noble Subjects and Servants, amongst the <i>Mexicans</i>,
who are themselves of a proud and ambitious spirit, and chiefly the Nobility,
which doth manifestly appear by their Apparel, more gorgeous than
the meaner sort of <i>Americans</i>; and though the Slaves go stark naked (having
onely a Cloth tied about their Privities) and with a Bowe and Arrows walk
before their Lords, yet the Better Sort go very costly Habited; for about
their Necks they wear Strings of Pearl; on their Heads, a Cap, from whence
hang down two Scarfs, one longer than the other; then a party-colour’d
Cotton Coat covers their whole Bodies to their Knees, under which they wear
a Vest girt about their Middle.</p>

<p class='c010'>But at last, after all these Services, <i>Cortez</i> disagreeing with the Vice-Roy

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Anno 1540.</i> <i>Gottierez</i> being chosen Governor of <i>New Carthage</i>, weigh’d Anchor
from <i>Cadiz</i>, and sailing to <i>Nombre de Dios</i>, upon his Landing clash’d with
<i>Roderick Contreras</i>, in whose Place he was sent to succeed. Two Years he spent
without effecting any thing; but at last coming to Agreement with <i>Contreras</i>,
he took the Governorship upon him, having first forewarn’d him not to depend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>too much upon his Authority; for the Countrey being full of Woods
and Mountains, might hide many of his Enemies: But he not regarding the
Advice, went a Journey from <i>New Granada</i>, and having march’d fifty Leagues
Easterly, he cross’d into the River <i>Suere</i>, with sixty <i>Spaniards</i>, and was presented
by the Princes of the Countrey with as much Gold as amounted to seven
thousand Duckets. Here he spent some Weeks, effecting little; but now all
things growing scarce, though he was very earnest with the Natives for Provisions,
yet he could get little; which kind of Life the Soldiers disliking, and
growing weary of, went away in the Night to <i>Nicaragua</i>. <i>Gottierez</i> thus left
alone, got into a Boat, with intent to follow them; and being just put off
from the Shore, was met by Captain <i>Barjanto</i>, who brought new Forces and
fresh Provisions with him: This wrought upon him to stay there. Not long
after <i>Alphonso de Pisa</i> went with twenty seven Men from <i>Nombre de Dios</i> to the
same River <i>Suere</i>; but it being then very rough at the Entrance, he was necessitated
to pass on to a small uninhabited Isle, where whilst he lay at an Anchor,
the Weather began to grow worse and worse; the Gusts of Wind, mix’d with
Showres of Rain, Thunder, and Lightning, seem’d to threaten a general Destruction;
for in the Ship two <i>Spaniards</i> and one <i>Moor</i> were kill’d by the
Lightning: In seventy two Days, the Sun did not shine four Hours: At last
weighing Anchor, he sail’d over to the Main Land, where he saw nothing but
vast Mountains and Wildernesses. Here for a time they liv’d upon Cockles
found on the Shore, and wild Fruits in the Woods: At length coming to <i>Gottierez</i>,
he sent him with his People in five Boats to fetch new Forces from <i>Nombre
de Dios</i>. In his way thither he saw a House built of Canes, cover’d with
Palm-leaves, forty five Paces long, and built after an Oval fashion: Round
about it stood several lesser Hovels, all which making up a Village, the <i>Spaniards</i>
nam’d <i>Francisco</i>, because they came thither on <i>St. Francis</i> Day. About half
way they met with the Lords of <i>Suere</i> and <i>Chiuppa</i>, going to attend <i>Gottierez</i>,
to whom being admitted, and sitting with him at Table, he gave them, as a
Dainty, rosted Chickens and fresh Pork; but they gave it to their Servants, not
delighting in the taste of such Victuals. <i>Gottierez</i>, by means of an Interpreter,
told them concerning the <i>Christian Religion</i>, at which they bow’d their
Heads, without making any Answer: But how little mind they had to embrace
it, quickly appear’d; for not long after, they set their Villages on fire,
and all the Provisions which they could not carry with them, they spoil’d, and
so retiring, hid themselves upon inaccessible Mountains. Another Incentive
leading them to this Fight, was, because the Governor <i>Camachiren</i>, and his Deputy
(notwithstanding he had given <i>Gottierez</i> as much Gold, when he came
first into the Countrey, as amounted to seven thousand Duckets, as we mention’d
before) yet was put in Prison by his Order, contrary to all Promises:
Nay, <i>Gottierez</i> threatned to burn him not regarding, that he had besides receiv’d
of him several Pieces of Gold, resembling all manner of Beasts, as Tygers,
and others; and also Fishes and Fowls curiously wrought, which were
valu’d at two Tun of Gold; yet this Present seemed too little for him,
whereupon bringing the Prisoner to a Chest, he swore that he would rost him
by degrees, if in four days time he did not furnish him with four times as
much more Gold as that Chest would hold: Whereupon <i>Chamachiren</i>’s Servants
went away to get the requir’d Gold; but he, through carelesness of the Watch,
made his escape in the Night, so that <i>Gottierez</i> lost his Booty. But the other
Prisoners, though threatned to be torn asunder with Dogs, remain’d firm,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>disowning that they had any Gold; and among the rest, one speaking boldly
to the <i>Spanish</i> Officer said, <i>That he stood amaz’d at his treacherous dealings, why did he
keep him Chain’d against Law and Promise, and often threaten’d him with death, but yet
would not kill him, for he, said he, had rather choose to die, than live so miserable
a life</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gottierez</i>’s Conscience troubling him, he would willingly have releas’d the
<i>Indian</i>, and the rather, because he promis’d to procure a great ransome of
Gold; but the inferior Commanders would not consent to it. After this they
march’d six days through great Wildernesses, and over high Mountains, finding
no Footsteps of any People. Lastly, They came down a very dangerous
and steep Mountain, where had not the Shrubs and jutting Stones serv’d them
to hold by, they had all broken their Necks.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Dangerous Mountains.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Huts.</div>

<p class='c010'>Fifteen Leagues, the hanging of this Mountain spread it self along a sweet
River, on whose opposite Shore stood strange Huts full of dead Tygers, Deers
Heads, and Legs; here they staid two days to rest themselves, where the Trees
<i>Mamei</i> and the <i>Cazabi</i> Plants yielded them good Food.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Valiant fight.</div>

<p class='c010'>Travelling forward, <i>Gottierez</i> ask’d an <i>Indian</i> which was the nearest way to a
Village, but he pretending not to know any near hand, had his Head immediately
cut off. In like manner, and for the same reason the <i>Indian</i> Prince
should also have been Executed, had not <i>Gottierez</i> given order to the contrary;
seeing his resolution, that with no less Patience than undaunted Courage,
stretch’d forth his Neck to the Executioners. Mean while, their Provisions decreasing,
they suffer’d extreme hunger; insomuch, that some fainted quite
away. The Souldiers also rebelling against <i>Gottierez</i> for Food, he commanded
them to kill their Dogs, and stamp the Barks of Trees; two days they travelled
much discontented in this manner, and at last came to the entrance of
a Wood, where they espy’d an <i>Indian</i> standing behind a Tree, which on a sudden
ran away with incredible swiftness: early the next morning, above four
thousand <i>Indians</i> came Marching against the faint <i>Spaniards</i>, making a terrible
noise with Horns and Drums; they were all except their Princes Painted black
and red; some wore Plumes of Feathers on their Heads, and Collars of the
same about their Necks; the fight began very fiercely, by casting abundance
of Stones, and shooting of Arrows, wherein, though <i>Gottierez</i> was at first
Wounded, yet after half an hour the Assailants fled, but recruited with fresh
Forces renew’d the fight, breaking into their Ranks, and making so great
slaughter amongst them with Woodden Swords, and Palm-Tree Clubs,
knocking down, and dealing such deadly Wounds, that of the <i>Spaniards</i>, three
onely escap’d, saving themselves by flight, who two hours after, much
amaz’d and terrify’d, came to their reserve, consisting onely of twenty four
Men, which <i>Alphonso de Risa</i> Commanded; the insulting Enemy at their
Heels, waving over their Heads the Swords, Shields, and Cross-Bows
which they had gotten from the slain <i>Spaniards</i>; and some withal crying in the
<i>Spanish</i> Tongue, <i>Come Christians, come, and take Gold</i>. But <i>de Risa</i>, for all their pride,
set them going with some Volleys of Shot; after this, escaping innumerable
other dangers, he came to <i>Nombre de Dios</i>, without having effected any thing of
Note.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Pizarro</i>’s and <i>Almagro</i>’s remarkable exploits.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>In the City of <i>Panama</i>, in <i>New Spain</i>, liv’d three eminent <i>Spaniards</i>, call’d <i>Francisco
Pizarro</i>, <i>Diego de Almagro</i>, and <i>Ferdinand de Luque</i> a Priest, which joyntly
design’d to discover farther Southerly along the rich Gold and Pearl Coast,
and inspect the Southern Ocean. <i>De Luque</i> was to look to home-affairs, and
<i>Pizarro</i> set Sail first with a Ship Man’d with one hundred and fourteen Men,
which <i>Almagro</i> follow’d with seventy more, yet both were valiantly repuls’d
by the <i>Peruvians</i>; but although they return’d the first time with bad success,
yet they undertook their business once more, but with no better fortune;
whereupon discouraged, the undertaking seem’d to be totally laid aside, and
the <i>American</i> Vice-Roy, <i>Peter de Rios</i> forbad any to attempt a farther Discovery
concerning <i>Peru</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The former difficulties with this Edict easily wrought upon <i>Pizarro</i>’s men,
all but twelve, to leave him, for the rest went over with the Ship fitted out by
<i>Rios</i> with succors to the Island <i>Gallo</i>, where <i>Pizarro</i> resided, having also fail’d
in his second Expedition. But although he had made two bad Voyages, yet
having an inclination to a third attempt, he went to <i>Spain</i>, desiring of the Emperor
to be Governor of <i>Peru</i>, which he had discover’d; for besides his Plea
of Merits he had taken possession of the Country twice by Landing there, intended
for the use of his Imperial Majesty; one of his Sea-men to that purpose
flourishing his two-handed Sword over his Head, the glittering of which
Sword so frighted the Natives, that none of them durst come near him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Pizarro</i>’s fight on <i>Puna</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>His request being consulted upon, was at last granted, the Government of
<i>Peru</i> being conferred upon him; but <i>Almagro</i> took it very ill, that <i>Pizarro</i> went
to the Emperor on such a design for himself; yet by the mediation of his
Friends the difference was reconciled, then <i>Pizarro</i> setting Sail with one hundred
and fifty Foot besides Horse, and Landing at the Island <i>Puna</i>, at first was
courteously entertain’d; but the <i>Spaniards</i> by extravagant hunting and searching
every where their Houses for Gold, and committing several other outrages,
incensing, chang’d the humor of the Inhabitants so much, that they fell upon
them. In stead of Ensigns, Standards, and Warlike Trophies, they used long
Canes, at the end whereof were ty’d the Bones of their antient Hero’s, honor’d
by them after their death: But these Reliques sav’d not the <i>Indians</i> from
slaughter, so well as the coverts of a neighboring Wood.</p>

<p class='c010'>From this Isle, lying three degrees Southward of the <i>Equinoctial</i>, <i>Pizarro</i> passed
over to the <i>Main Continent</i>, where they were all in a great confusion, upon
the report of the <i>Spaniards</i> cruelties committed in <i>Puna</i>; yet all the preparations
of the <i>Indians</i> to withstand, stop’d not <i>Pizarro</i> from his intended course;
for first, having the success to master <i>Tampez</i>, thence he made nothing to march
his Forces over the River <i>Ambato</i>, there burning a Temple Dedicated to the
Sun. The <i>Portico</i> stood towards the East, the rising of their God, before which
hung a Curtain of their fine Cotton Stuff, within stood the presentations of
two Golden Rams, shaded with Black, and as many Dragons, before which
the Fire never went out, continually supply’d with Offerings of burnt Incense;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>on the Pillars hung several Men flead, their Flesh kept firm, and free from all

<p class='c010'><i>Peter Alvarado</i> inform’d concerning the Riches of <i>Peru</i>, and well knowing
how to insinuate with the Emperor in his fawning Letters, at last by his
Friends so prevail’d, that he also got leave to go thither; in pursuance of
which, <i>Anno 1534.</i> he Weigh’d Anchor with seven Ships from <i>Guatimala</i>, a City
built by him between two Mountains. But Landing at <i>Puerto Viejo</i>, and
Marching Easterly over Snowy Mountains, he was met by <i>Almagro</i>, between
whom a bloody incounter was like to have happen’d, but after some time, a
Treaty being set a Foot, they came to a Composition on these Articles: That
<i>Alvarado</i> upon the receipt of a hundred thousand Duckets, should leave his
Men with <i>Almagro</i>, and depart from <i>Peru</i>; with which sum, being inrich’d,
he soon after fitted out fourteen Sail to discover new Countreys to the West;
but being busie in his preparations, was sent for to <i>Mexico</i> by <i>Don Antonio Mendoza</i>
the Vice-Roy, to undertake a Voyage with him to the new-discover’d
Countrey of <i>Sibolla</i>, abounding in Gold and Saffron, according to the report
of four <i>Dominican</i> Monks; and having already rais’d seven hundred Men, news
came to <i>Mexico</i>, that <i>Peter Zunica</i> had receiv’d an overthrow by the <i>Indians</i> of <i>Salisco</i>;
to whose assistance <i>Alvarado</i> March’d with all speed, and found the <i>Indians</i>
incamp’d on a high Mountain, fortifi’d with conjoyn’d Trees, and great
Stones ty’d together with Rushes, behind which they were secure from Shot.
The <i>Spaniards</i> climbing up the Mountain, approach’d their Works, when on a
sudden the Defendants giving a great Shout, cut the Cords which held their
Fortification together, whereupon the Stones and Trees tumbled down with
such force, that they kill’d both Men and Horse, few escaping alive: In this
conflict <i>Alvarado</i> himself was lost. His Wife <i>Beatrix Cuova</i> made a stately Funeral
for her Husband, and caus’d her House to be Painted black, refusing either
to Eat or Drink for a set time, yet notwithstanding, all her pretence of sorrow,
she so minded her business, that she took the Government of <i>Guatimala</i>
into her own hands; but her Dominion lasted not long, for on the eighteenth
of <i>September, Anno 1541.</i> happen’d a hideous Tempest of Wind and Rain, mixt
with continual Lightning, and horrible claps of Thunder, and what was
more terrible, was answer’d with roars and horrid bellowings from the caverns
of the Mountain, at whose foot <i>Guatimala</i> stood. About midnight the
Mountain was deliver’d, whose Birth was the irruption of an Inundating River,
a precipitate torrent tumbling down full of Rocks and Stones, which
carry’d all before it, so that in few minutes <i>Guatimala</i> was utterly swept away,
not the least mark remaining, nor any left alive except <i>Alvarado</i>’s Bastard
Daughter by an <i>Indian</i>; and in the adjacent Fields, some few, and they maim’d,
with broken Arms or Legs; after this utter destruction, they re-built another
<i>Guatimala</i>, three Leagues more Easterly. But though <i>Alvarado</i> was lost in this
Enterprize, yet the Voyage to <i>Sibolla</i> was not laid aside, for <i>Francisco Velasques</i>
March’d thither with eight hundred Men, of which most were Horse, but
found nought else but Snowy Mountains and barren Plains, insomuch, that
his Men and Horses were starv’d for want of Provision; wherefore he return’d
without success to <i>Mexico</i>, having onely burnt some Villages, and had several
Rencounters with the Natives.</p>

it, march’d directly to <i>Caxamalca</i>, where <i>Attabaliba</i> kept his Court, who again
sent other Messengers to them with command to leave his Dominions. <i>Pizarro</i>
made answer, that he could not obey any Commands but those of his Master
the Emperor, who had order’d him to speak with the King himself at his own
Palace.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Attabaliba</i> hearing that <i>Pizarro</i> resolv’d to come forward, sent him a pair of
Painted Shooes and Armlets, that he might put them on when he appear’d before
his Throne: Captain <i>Ferdinand Sotto</i> march’d before with twenty Horse, passing
close on the Flank of <i>Attabaliba</i>’s Army: The <i>Indians</i> amaz’d at the prauncing
of their Horses, retreated into their Fortifications, but were for their
cowardize immediately slain by the King’s Order.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>His discourse with a <i>Spanish</i> Bishop, and his apparel.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Sotto</i> sent a Message to <i>Attabaliba</i>, That the <i>Spaniards</i> desir’d peaceably to Treat
with him, to which he receiv’d answer, That no Peace could be made, unless
they restor’d the Gold and Silver to the Owners, which they had Plunder’d
from them, and forsook his Territories; which so doing, they should have
Audience the next day: Hereupon the Bishop <i>Vincent de Villa Viridi</i> was conducted
into the Royal Palace, in the City of <i>Caxamalca</i>, and brought before <i>Attabaliba</i>,
who came thither in great State, with a Guard of twenty five thousand
Men; he was carry’d on the Shoulders of his prime Nobles in a Sedan,
about which hung Garlands of Gold, and divers colour’d Feathers; himself
was cloth’d in a white loose Vest, without Sleeves; his Temples were bound
with a red Ribbon, with a long Tassel on his left Cheek; on his Fore-head
stuck three curious Feathers; before him March’d three hundred of his Life-Guard,
all in one Livery, who clear’d the way through which the King was
to pass. The before-mention’d Bishop carry’d in one Hand a Cross, in the
other a Book, discoursing with the King to this effect; <i>That God is the Trinity</i>,
Adam <i>the first Man</i>; <i>Christ Born of a Virgin, dy’d on the Cross</i>; <i>the</i> Pope <i>God’s
Vice-Gerent, who according to the Power he had from Heaven, had given</i> Peru <i>to the Emperor</i>
Charles, <i>as also all other Countreys in</i> America; <i>and if he should prove obstinate,
and resist, he must expect nothing less than utter ruine</i>. <i>Attabaliba</i> reply’d, <i>That he serv’d</i>
Pachamaca, <i>being the Creator of all things; and next to him the Sun and Moon: How
glorious do they appear</i> (said he) <i>in comparison of a Crucifi’d God? To make Peace and
Alliance with mighty Princes, was the true Foundation of wise Government: But the</i> Pope
<i>must needs be senseless, devoy’d of all reason, and withal highly unjust, to give away what
was none of his own</i>, viz. <i>other mens Kingdoms, in which he never had the least or smallest
concern. Moreover, he would not desert that Religion which he and his Ancestors had
maintain’d so many Ages, and the rather, because there are no apparent or sufficient Testimony
of the truth of Christianity.</i> The latter clause was thus answer’d, saying,
<i>This Book, O King, which I hold in my hand, proves and declares all that you question</i>.
<i>Attabaliba</i> looking upon it, turn’d it over Leaf by Leaf, then look’d more intentively
upon the Print, which done he clap’d it to either Ear, and at last as
altogether unsatisfi’d, in disdainful manner threw it away.</p>

<p class='c010'>But <i>Pizarro</i> gaining time while the King and Bishop thus discours’d, had
drawn his Men in Battel-Array, his sixty Horse he divided into three Wings,
Commanded by his three Brothers, <i>Ferdinand</i>, <i>John</i>, and <i>Gonzalvo Pizarro</i>, left
the Captains <i>Sotto</i> and <i>Bavalcazar</i> in an Ambuscade; <i>Peter de Canada</i> march’d in
the Van, and he himself in the main Body, leaving <i>Sotto</i> in the Rear.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Attabaliba</i> taken prisoner.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Bids for his ransom an unvaluable treasure.</div>

<p class='c010'>So soon as the Bishop could acquaint them in what scornful manner <i>Attabaliba</i> had thrown his Holy Book, <i>The Word of God</i>, upon the ground; both Armies
were Engaged, whilst their Trumpets sounded, their Drums beat, their
Canons roar’d, the Horses neigh’d, and the Dogs bark’d, they made a speedy
march up against the Walls of <i>Taxamalca</i>, which dreadful mixture of terrible
noises struck such a Pannick fear into the hearts of the <i>Indians</i>, that they all presently
broke, in their flight crowding one another to death at the Gates of the
City, which being too narrow to receive them, they themselves made breaches
in their own Walls to enter; which opportunity the <i>Spaniards</i> no ways neglected,
but entering with them, shot and kill’d all they could reach; their Dogs
also having no little share in the slaughter; whole companies of Indians were
trode under the Horses feet, yet near <i>Attabaliba</i>’s Chair was the greatest resistance,
for no sooner fell one of the Bearers, but immediately another supply’d
the place; so that the King was surrounded with heaps of his own slain Subjects,
to whom <i>Pizarro</i> himself Charg’d up so close, that having seiz’d him by
his long Hair, he pull’d him out of his Throne, and having gotten him under
him, secur’d immediately in Fetters; whereupon all his Life-Guard forsook
him, and fled: But the loss of the Battel, which was <i>Attabaliba</i>’s utter ruine,
was laid upon <i>Runninagui</i>, a Captain appointed to lie in Ambush, so to fall in
the Rear of the <i>Spaniards</i> with five thousand men; but was so far from performing
his Orders, that terrifi’d at the uncouth noise of the Guns, and the
rest, that he fled one hundred and fifty Leagues Southerly, before he stopt, or
scarce ever look’d behind him in so long a flight. Mean while, <i>Attabaliba</i> compounded
with <i>Pizarro</i> for his Ransom, <i>viz.</i> to pay him as much Gold as that
Hall in his Court (where they made the Agreement) could hold to the top;
they first measur’d the heighth, then the length, which was found to be fifty
four Foot, and the breadth nine: In pursuance of this composition, Gold was
brought thither from all places, according to <i>Attabaliba</i>’s order; yet he could
not raise so much as would perform his bargain, which made the <i>Spaniards</i> to
grumble: But <i>Attabaliba</i> desiring some longer time to perform it, telling <i>Pizarro</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>that most of the Gold was brought on Slaves Shoulders, a long and
troublesome way, of two hundred Leagues long, from the City <i>Cusco</i>, and if
this would not satisfie, <i>Pizarro</i> might send some of his own people thither, to
inform him, that he need not fear the least danger, as long as he was Prisoner
with his Wife and Children.</p>

<p class='c010'>The two Captains, <i>Sotto</i>, and <i>Peter del Baro</i> being sent away to that purpose,
met after some days Journey with one of <i>Attabaliba</i>’s Leaders, who was bringing
the King’s Brother <i>Guascar</i> with a Party, Prisoner to <i>Caxamalca</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Burns his Brother <i>Guascar</i> alive.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Guascar</i> had now a fair opportunity to crave assistance of the <i>Spaniards</i>, telling
them, that he and <i>Attabaliba</i> were the Sons of <i>Guaynacava</i>, so that the Kingdom
was to be divided betwixt both. But <i>Attabaliba</i> had by force made himself
Master of all, whereas he being the youngest, ought to be satisfi’d with that
share which <i>Guascar</i>, being the eldest, would assign him; for the right of Inheritance
belong’d justly to him, and yet he was carry’d away bound to slaughter:
But if <i>Pizarro</i> would do justice in delivering him out of his Brothers
bloody Hands, he would raise him thrice as much Gold as <i>Attabaliba</i> had promis’d:
To which purpose he desir’d <i>Sotto</i> and <i>Baro</i> to put off their Journey to
<i>Cusco</i>; which they not daring to do, went on their way, and <i>Guascar</i> descending
the Valley <i>Sucsuhuana</i>, was burnt alive by <i>Attabaliba</i>’s Soldiers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mean while, <i>Almagro</i> came with fresh Forces to <i>Taxamalca</i>, which occasion’d
no small trouble in <i>Pizarro</i>, who was onely thirsty after Gold: On the other
side, <i>Almagro</i> as greedy, grew jealous that <i>Pizarro</i> should keep the promis’d
Hall full of Gold for himself, and he should have no share, because <i>Attabaliba</i>
was his Prisoner; therefore he earnestly desir’d that <i>Attabaliba</i> might privately
be made away, and that the Booty might be divided to one as well as the
other.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An incredible sum of Money given to the Soldiers.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Attabaliba</i> strangled.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Pizarro</i> to prevent all inconveniencies that might happen from his dissenting,
gave in the presence of the King to every private Soldier a thousand
Duckets in Gold, and six thousand five hundred twenty five Silver Crowns;
the inferior Officers receiv’d four and thirty thousand Crowns, and the others
sixty thousand; the fifth part of the Booty he reserv’d for the Emperor: And
notwithstanding <i>Attabaliba</i> perform’d his promise in filling the Hall full of
Gold, yet he had the sentence of Death pronounc’d against him; neither
would his excuse of Innocency serve, or his Requests to be sent to <i>Spain</i>, there
to clear himself before the Emperor; but sighing, and lamenting his misfortunes,
was ty’d to a Post, and Strangled in the presence of <i>Pizarro</i>. For whose
Death, though a <i>Heathen</i>, Divine Vengeance pursu’d these cruel and unjust Arbitrators
that thus made their Will a Law, none of them dying a natural
Death.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover it was observ’d, that a few days before this Execution a blazing
Star appear’d, which <i>Attabaliba</i> seeing, presaging sadly of himself said, <i>That a
great Prince would die in a short time</i>; but <i>Pizarro</i>’s chief pretences for the Kings
just suffering was, that he had cruelly murder’d his Brother <i>Guascar</i>: But this
was a meer blind, for that that incens’d them against <i>Attabaliba</i>, was, that he
knowing where the unvaluable treasure lay, which <i>Guascar</i> had bury’d, would
not discover it to them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>And takes <i>Cusco</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Unvaluable Treasures taken.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable passage of a Dog.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Attabaliba</i>, before his death, desir’d that he might be bury’d in the Territory
<i>Quito</i>, by his Father <i>Guaynacava</i>, whom the <i>Peruvians</i> for his great Justice and
Prudence in Government, believed that he would arise, and settle the World so
troubled and full of disorder in peace and quiet: The Corps was accordingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>carry’d thither in great State after their manner, attended by his Brother,
whom <i>Illescas Ruminagui</i> which ran from <i>Attabaliba</i> in the Battel, where he lay
in ambush when he might have done them good service; in the way to his entertainment,
receiv’d with all shews of sorrow; but when they were feasted
to excess, bury’d in sleep and Wine, he Massacred and flea’d <i>Illescas</i> the Kings
Brother alive, and made a Taber of his Skin. Whilst <i>Attabaliba</i>’s Funeral
was thus bloodily solemniz’d, his General <i>Quizquiz</i> rais’d a great Army,
which <i>Pizarro</i> encountring after a valiant resistance, totally routed; then
marching victoriously to <i>Cusco</i>, he saw great Fires in the City, and the Citizens
fighting with the <i>Spaniards</i>, sent before; but the Horse breaking in upon
them, most of them fled the next morning to the Mountains: Thus the <i>Spaniards</i>
became Masters of the City, where they inflicted the most cruel tortures
on all Sexes, by that means to force them to discover, if they knew of any hidden
Treasures, being not satisfi’d with what they found there, although they
had gotten a greater Treasure in <i>Cusco</i> than that that they had extorted from
<i>Attabaliba</i> before: Nay, they gave those that were murther’d for Food to their
Dogs: Among the rest, <i>Didacus Salazar</i> having a very fierce Dog call’d <i>Bezerril</i>,
had also an old <i>Indian</i> Woman his Prisoner, to whom he gave a Letter to deliver
to the General <i>Pizarro</i>; the Woman had not gone many Paces before she
was set upon by <i>Bezerril</i>, whom <i>Salazar</i> let loose, that he might delight himself
in seeing the Dog tear the poor old Woman; but she observing him come running
at her with so great fierceness, fell down upon her Knees, and holding forth
the Letter, cry’d, <i>Good my Lord, good my Lord Dog, I must carry this Letter to General</i>
Pizarro, whereupon the furious Curr having more compassion than the
<i>Spaniard</i>, stood still a little, and at last lifted up his Leg in a scornful manner,
Urin’d upon her, and return’d satisfi’d; at which sportive behavior of the Cur
and the Chrone, <i>Salazar</i> laughing, was so well pleas’d, that he gave the Woman
her life.</p>

<p class='c010'>After <i>Cusco</i> had been sufficiently Plunder’d, <i>Pizarro</i> made <i>Almagro</i> Governor
thereof, with the Territories belonging to it, and built near the River <i>Lima</i> a
Town, which they call’d <i>Los Reyes</i>. Mean while, <i>Almagro</i> receiv’d Letters
Patent from the Emperor, in which he was nominated <i>Marshal</i> of <i>Peru</i>; encourag’d
by that honor, he took a great design in hand, for the <i>Peruvians</i> had
reported, that the Golden <i>Chili</i> lay to the South; and <i>Almagro</i> being encourag’d,
and assisted by <i>Pizarro</i>, March’d inquest thereof with two Troops of Horse, and
five hundred Foot: But mean while there happen’d so great Rains, and such
foul Weather, that the Ways were almost unpassable, so that the Expedition
grew very troublesome; yet however he went on, in which hard March he lost
both Horse and Men.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Almagro</i> strangled.</div>

<p class='c010'>Whilst <i>Almagro</i> was upon this undertaking, <i>Francisco Pizarro</i> receiv’d Letters
Patent from the Emperor, in which he was Intitul’d <i>Duke of Peru</i>, but with a
<i>Salvo</i> for the honor before given to <i>Almagro</i>; yet these balanc’d honors bred
great dissention between the Duke and Marshal, which <i>Mango Inga</i> another
of <i>Attabaliba</i>’s Brothers observing, laid hold of the opportunity, and setting
upon the <i>Spanish</i> Garrison in <i>Cusco</i>, took the City. Whereupon <i>Pizarro</i> immediately
sent his Horse thither, under the Command of <i>Alphonso Alvarado</i>, and
<i>Gomes de Todoya</i>, against whom the <i>Indians</i> fought very valiantly, insomuch,
that the Battel was a long time doubtful; yet at last the <i>Spaniards</i> got a bloody
Victory, and regain’d <i>Cusco</i>; hither after some time, <i>Almagro</i> returning with ill
success, having effected nothing, was kept out by <i>Ferdinand Pizarro</i>, under pretence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>that he could not open the Gate without Order from his Brother the
Duke. <i>Almagro</i> much offended thereat, yet saying little, was so privately let
into the City, that he surpriz’d the Governor <i>Ferdinand Pizarro</i>, and his Brother
<i>Gonsalvo</i>, with <i>Alphonso Alvarado</i> Prisoners; swearing that he would not rest before
he had rooted all the <i>Pizarro</i>’s out of Peru. But whilst he was passing the
intended Sentence of Death upon them, <i>Gonsalvo</i> and <i>Alvarado</i> broke Prison;
and got away to the Duke, who troubled for his Brother <i>Ferdinand</i> there in custody,
and in danger of his life, came to Composition; whereupon <i>Ferdinand</i>
was also releas’d: But this was no sooner done, and he had got his Brother safe
there, but the Duke regarding nothing less than the keeping of the new-made
Peace, sent to <i>Almagro</i>, that the Emperor having given him the prime Command
over <i>Peru</i>, he requir’d him to leave <i>Cusco</i>, or else he would force him.
<i>Almagro</i> sent answer, That if he could see the Emperor’s Hand, he would immediately
obey, otherwise not; whereupon both Parties prepar’d for War,
wherein they had many sharp bickerings in a short time: But <i>Almagro</i> being
too weak fell into the Dukes hands, who order’d him to be strangled in the
Gaol, and his body afterwards to be drawn to the Market-place, and there
publickly Beheaded.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Ferdinand Pizarro</i> being not long after sent to <i>Spain</i>, with the fifths of the
gotten Treasure for the Emperor, was Imprison’d in the Castle <i>Motto</i>, for <i>Almagro</i>’s
Death: But what further happen’d to him there, or became of him,
hath never been Recorded by any Pen.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Ferdinand Pizarro</i> never obtains his liberty.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Young <i>Almagro</i> stabs the Duke.</div>

<p class='c010'>But young <i>Almagro</i>, instigated by his Guardian <i>John Rada</i>, resolving, to
be reveng’d for his Fathers Death; to that purpose he went to <i>Los Reyes</i>,
where by the help of some hir’d Male-contents, he design’d to Murder the Duke
upon St. <i>John</i>’s day, in the Church at high Service: But this business was not
so closely carry’d, but the Duke had some inkling thereof, who therefore
stay’d at home, and went not to Mass that day. The Conspirators doubting
the event, hearing that their Plot was discover’d, though defeated in their
purpose, yet not fail’d in their Courage, ran at noon day to the Palace, crying,
<i>Kill the Tyrant, kill the Traytor</i>. But <i>Pizarro</i> being so much forewarn’d, had
lock’d up the Gates, and arm’d himself, which when they could not enter, yet
they went back through the City, and waving a bloody Sword, cry’d, <i>Pizarro
is slain</i>; this being believ’d, above two hundred private Friends to <i>Almagro</i> appear’d,
who all ran to the Palace, crouding about the Gates: And <i>Francisco de
Chares</i> coming out at a private Door, hoping to pacifie the Mutineers, was
immediately Stab’d; but they rushing in the way he came, found some stout
opposition, for seven Halberdiers of his Guard fought till they were all kill’d
in the Dukes presence; but <i>Pizarro</i> was taken alive, and being brought before
<i>Almagro</i>, he Savagely Butcher’d him with his own hands; which done, they
ran crying along the Streets, <i>Long live the Emperor, and</i> Didacus Almagro.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Great slaughter in <i>Los Reye</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>But after all this, <i>Pizarro</i>’s Party joyning together, valiantly withstood the
Conspirators, so that a considerable number were slain on both sides, yet <i>Almagro</i>
at last getting the better, confiscated the Goods of all those that were
against him; and now every one shew’d him the respect of Chief Governor,
till the Emperor should either settle him, or send another.</p>

<p class='c010'>From hence Marching to <i>Cusco</i>, he had like to have paid for all, but prevented
by private intelligence thereof; which happen’d thus,</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Garcias Alvarado</i> and <i>Christopher Sotello</i> were Joynt-Governors of <i>Cusco</i>; but
quarrelling, and coming to Blows in like manner, <i>Sotello</i> was slain: This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span><i>Almagro</i> took very hainously, as being his intimate Friend, giving forth threatning
Speeches of Revenge; which <i>Alvarado</i> inform’d of, and intending some
way or other to prevent all Dangers, and save himself, he invited <i>Almagro</i> to a
Feast, but privately resolving to make it a Bloody Banquet, by his Death at
the Table. Of this he being inform’d, as we mention’d before, staid at home,
and privately sent for some Soldiers that had belong’d to <i>Sotello</i>, sending
word that he was indispos’d: <i>Alvarado</i>, under a shew of Kindness, goes to
<i>Almagro</i>, hoping to perswade him to come to his prepar’d Treat; but so soon
as he was enter’d the Hall, they clapp’d to the Gate, and the Soldiers falling
upon <i>Alvarado</i>, slew him: But soon after <i>Almagro</i> was call’d in question, and
not long enjoy’d this his usurp’d Authority; for the Emperor <i>Charles</i> sending
the Learned <i>Vacca de Castro</i> with full Authority to <i>Peru</i>, to settle that disturb’d
Kingdom, <i>Almagro</i> now us’d to Govern, had no Ears to become a Subject;
therefore he march’d with an Army to meet <i>Castro</i>, by whom, after a bloody
Fight, being beaten and put to flight, having four thousand Men, he fell into
the Victors Hands near <i>Cusco</i>, where he was treated very severely; for shortly
after he was condemn’d to be Beheaded; others were strangled, and some
torn in pieces with Horses.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Murders <i>Xuarez</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Is taken and put in Prison.</div>

<p class='c010'>Not long after this great Execution, <i>Blasco Nunnez Vela</i> came to <i>Peru</i>, and
being appointed Vice-Roy, had four Councellors assign’d him, with whom
he was to consult in all Affairs; and especially to set the <i>Indians</i> at liberty,
which till then had suffer’d much misery under the <i>Spanish</i> Tyranny: To
perform which, the Emperor had given an Order under his Great Seal, which
was to be publish’d and proclaim’d in all Places. <i>Vela</i> at his arrival faithfully
perform’d all his Commands, seiz’d upon <i>Vacca de Castro</i>, because he had Executed
<i>Almagro</i> without any Examination or Tryal; yet by this means he got
the hatred of all, so that most of the <i>Spaniards</i> chose <i>Gonsalvo Pizarro</i> for their
Chief, whereby Affairs grew daily more and more out of Order. <i>Nunnez
Vela</i> laid all the blame thereof upon <i>William Xuarez</i>, Governor of <i>Lima</i>, whom
he sent for in the Night, and correcting over-severely, gave him also two mortal
Wounds, of which he presently died: The Body was in the Morning
drawn along the Streets, which caus’d so great a murmuring amongst the Inhabitants,
that soon after they seem’d to make a general Insurrection: Wherefore
<i>Nunnez Vela</i> fearing the worst, resolv’d to convey himself from thence <i>incognito</i>,
and pass to <i>Truxillo</i>: But his four Councellors advis’d him to the contrary;
yet he took his own way, causing all his Treasure to be sent aboard;
and having made ready his Horses to depart, the Common People in a tumultuous
manner set upon the Palace, catching, snatching up, and carrying away
all the Silver they could find, and meeting the Vice-Roy, seiz’d, and thrust him
into a Dungeon; which done, they fell at variance amongst themselves; for
some would have him executed, but others insisted to have him sent Prisoner
to <i>Spain</i>; which last being the more moderate, getting the upper Hand, <i>Vela</i> was
put aboard, and committed to the custody of <i>Didacus Alvarez</i>, who Anchoring in
the Mouth of the River <i>Tombez</i> (kindness growing betwixt them) releas’d the
Vice-Roy his Prisoner, and set him ashore, who not long after got some Forces
together.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Is Beheaded.</div>

<p class='c010'>Mean while <i>Pizarro</i> was every where acknowledg’d for Supreme Governor,
who having Intelligence of the Vice-Roys Design, sent <i>Francisco Carvayales</i> thither,
between whom and <i>Vela</i> was a sharp Encounter; but at last being worsted,
and retaken by <i>Carvayales</i>, he was soon after executed, and his Head plac’d
on a Pole near the Gallows.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>The Emperor <i>Charles</i> turmoil’d with Wars at home, saw no likelyhood to
settle the confus’d Affairs of <i>Peru</i>; yet at last he thought it convenient to send
one <i>Peter Gasca</i> thither, an Ecclesiastick, of a subtile and ingenious Wit, who
landing <i>Anno 1546.</i> in <i>Lima</i>, with no other Title than <i>Chief Councellor to the Emperor</i>,
took quite another course than <i>Vela</i>, perswading them all, that Affairs
should be setled in order, according to their own desires, and former Miscarriages
never be remembred, being utterly deleted by an Act of Oblivion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Gonsalves Pizarro</i> strangled.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Cruelty us’d on <i>Carvayales</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The News of this General Pardon spreading it self far and near, wrought
a great change; for <i>Pizarro</i>’s Intimates, and those nearest of Concern, shrunk
daily from him; which <i>Gasca</i> observing, march’d against him; and that they
might make the more haste, they loaded several <i>Peruvians</i>, chain’d, with their
Arms, whom when they lagg’d, they switch’d and whipp’d before them. And
now both Armies being met, and discharging their Cannons at one another,
with considerable loss to each side, whole Regiments came running over to
<i>Gasca</i>; so that <i>Pizarro</i> being quite forsaken, yielded himself to the mercy of
the Conqueror, who accus’d him of High Treason, and caus’d him to be
strangled in a Dungeon, and fix’d his Head on a Marble Pillar in <i>Lima</i>, environ’d
with Iron Rails, and inscrib’d with a brief Account of all his Offences.
But <i>Gasca</i> not thus satisfied, hang’d up several Commanders, and whipping and
stigmatizing others, condemn’d them after to the Gallies: But his greatest
spight was against the Field-Marshal <i>Carvayales</i>, a Person of the Age of fourscore
years, whom tying to a Horses Tail, he caus’d a whole Hour to be
drawn up and down the Market-place, scorn’d and derided of all People;
which done, he was quarter’d alive.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not long after <i>Gasca</i> surrendred the Command of <i>Peru</i> to the Learned <i>Cianca</i>,
and carried an unvaluable Treasure to <i>Germany</i>, for the Emperor <i>Charles</i>,
who gave him in requital for his faithful Service, the Bishoprick of <i>Valentia</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>His strange Entertainment amongst them.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>About the same time that <i>Gasca</i> arriv’d in <i>Spain</i>, <i>John Stade</i> had the Command
over a small Fort rais’d of Stone and Earth, on the Island <i>Maro</i>, adjacent
to <i>Brasile</i>, because the Salvage People of <i>Tupin Imba</i> sail’d twice a year from
the Countrey of Brikioka, to <i>Maro</i>, at the time when the Plant Abbati was ripe,
of which they made the Liquor that they generally drink at their Humane
Banquets: They also landed on Maro about the <i>Bratti</i>-Fishing. This <i>Bratti</i>
is a Fish of a very delicious taste, either caught in Nets, or shot by the <i>Tupin
Imba</i>, and carried to their several Habitations. Against these People <i>Stade</i> kept
a continual Guard, when <i>Heliodorus Hesse</i>, Son to <i>Eobanus Hesse</i>, the famous
<i>Latin</i> Poet in <i>Germany</i>, came to visit him. <i>Stade</i> to entertain his Guest the better,
went into the Woods to hunt for Venison, where he was taken by the <i>Tupin
Imba</i>, of which the King march’d in the Rear with a great Palm-Tree Club,
and carried him towards the Sea side, that he, with others that waited on the
Shore, might make up a <i>Kawewipepicke</i> (that is, <i>A Feast of Rosted Men</i>) But because
<i>Stade</i> being a <i>German</i> of a large Body, well-skinn’d, young, plump and
fat, they all concluded to spare this Dainty, and carry him alive to <i>Brikioka</i>,
that with such a Banquet they might highly caress their Wives: But the Journey
being long, and a just melancholy possessing him with fear, and the terror
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>of certain death, and to be Food for such ravenous <i>Cannibals</i>, so macerated and
consum’d him, that he was almost dwindled away to Skin and Bone; whereupon
thinking him thus lean to make but few savory Morsels, they chang’d
their resolutions, and growing better acquainted, he having learn’d their
Tongue, and being able to discourse with them, they lik’d his company so
well, that they let him live amongst them. Nine years <i>Stade</i> had been a Slave
amongst these Man-eaters, when the <i>French</i> coming thither, bought him for a
few Trifles, and carried him to <i>Normandy</i>, where landing <i>Anno 1555.</i> he went
from thence to <i>Hamburgh</i>, being his Native Countrey.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Durande</i> drowns three Religious Men.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Nicholas Durande</i> a <i>Frenchman</i> set Sail from <i>Havre de Grace</i>, at the same time
when <i>Stade</i> came thither. This <i>Durande</i> having lost a Castle in <i>Brittain</i>, to the
great prejudice of the <i>French</i>, out of a pretence of advancing their Affairs, and
to fill up their almost exhausted Treasury, reported, That the <i>Spanish</i> and <i>Portuguese</i>
Forces were driven out of <i>India</i>, where they had gather’d so much
Wealth; and it would certainly redound to the Honor and Profit of <i>France</i>,
if they could become Masters of the Gold and Silver Mines. King <i>Henry</i> the
Second approving of the Proposal, and the more because the Admiral <i>Gasper
Coligni</i> was also very earnest, looking upon it as a safe Retreat for the Protestants,
at that time cruelly persecuted: and <i>Durande</i>, sensible of the Admirals
thoughts, privately inform’d him, That in his <i>American</i> Design he chiefly aim’d
to plant a True Church of God in <i>America</i>, where the Professors might enjoy
themselves peaceably. This Report being spread amongst those that call’d
themselves <i>Protestants</i>, (fled from <i>Switzerland</i> in great numbers to <i>France</i>) made
many of them venture upon the Design; who having fitted themselves, and
setting sail with three Ships, after some time arriv’d on the Coast of <i>Brasile</i>,
and landed on the <i>Rock-Island</i>, in the Haven <i>Januario</i>: Here <i>Durande</i> built several
Watch-houses, and the Fort <i>Coligni</i>, which he fortified with a considerable
number of Guns: Not long after he writ to <i>John Calvin</i>, That he would please
to furnish this new Plantation in <i>Brasile</i> with good and able Teachers of the
Gospel; which Request being immediately taken into serious consideration by
the Classes, one <i>Philip Corguileray</i>, a Gentleman near <i>Geneva</i>, set Sail out of the
Haven <i>Honfleurs</i>, with three Ships, freighted with some Provisions, several Persons
of divers Trades, and two Ministers, <i>Peter Richer</i>, and <i>William Chartier</i>:
But he had scarce made <i>Africa</i>, when they began to have a scarcity of Victuals;
wherefore they turn’d their Design of setling the Gospel in <i>America</i>, to Pyracy,
where they made small scruple or difference, whether Friends or Foes, but
made Prize of all they could light upon, though indeed their Ministers both
preach’d and perswaded the contrary, amongst whom a Controversie happening,
put other Business into their Heads; for one <i>John Cointak</i>, formerly a <i>Parisian
Sorbonist</i>, was also amongst those that remov’d from <i>Geneva</i>, who pretended
that <i>Coligni</i> had promis’d him a Ministers place, so soon as he landed at <i>Brasile</i>;
but <i>Richer</i> and <i>Chartier</i>, not satisfied that there was any such Promise, and
consequently thinking themselves not obliged by his bare Assertion, told him,
That themselves being able, under God, to perform the Work, they needed no
such Coadjutor: This bred so great a Rancor between them, that <i>Cointak</i> accus’d
them for teaching false Doctrine, and chiefly that they did not mix the
Wine at their Sacraments with Water, which Father <i>Clemens</i> had strictly commanded.
<i>Durande</i>, being prevail’d on by the Cardinal of <i>Lorein</i>, joyn’d with
<i>Cointak</i>, and thereupon so sharply persecuted the <i>Protestants</i>, that he starv’d several
of them, which others to escape fled to the <i>Brasilians</i>: Nay, he took <i>John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Du Bordell</i>, <i>Matthias Vermeil</i>, and <i>Peter Bourdon</i>, out of their Sick-Beds, and tying
their Hands and Feet, threw them headlong from a Rock into the Sea:
Soon after which, the bloody Persecutor return’d with ill success to <i>France</i>,
where he wrote a Book against the Reform’d Religion; but all the Honor which
he gain’d was, that all Parties on both sides accounted him a distracted Person.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Unheard-of Hunger.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Florida</i> being upon the Continent of <i>America</i>, and so call’d by <i>John Pontæus</i>,
who landed there upon <i>Palm-Sunday</i>, though <i>Sebastian Gaboto</i> a <i>Venetian</i>, imploy’d
by <i>Henry</i> the Seventh King of <i>England</i>, landed there before, may well be
term’d <i>the</i> Europeans <i>Bloody Stage</i>, <i>Pontæus</i> being slain here: But <i>Ferdinand Sotto</i>
exercis’d against the Inhabitants inhumane Cruelty five years together; yet at
last died of a deep discontent, because he could not reach his Aims, having
condemn’d so many <i>Floridans</i> fruitlesly to dig for Gold in the Mines. However,
since that, <i>Julian Sumanus</i> and <i>Peter Ahumada</i> undertook the Work anew, but
with the like bad Success. <i>Anno 1545.</i> one <i>Lodowick Cancello</i>, a <i>Dominican</i>, thought
to effect great things with four of his Associates; but landing on <i>Florida</i>, was
destroy’d by the Natives. But <i>Gasper Coligni</i> the Marshal, neither discourag’d
by these miserable Proceedings, nor the former Treachery of <i>Durande</i>, prepar’d
for a new Expedition thither; and accordingly <i>John Ribald</i> was fitted
with two Ships from <i>Diep</i>, at the Charge of <i>Charles</i> the Ninth King of
<i>France</i>, wherewith having sail’d thirty Degrees Northern Latitude, he
came before the Promontory of <i>Francisco</i>, where he ran up into the Mouth of
a wide River, to which he gave the denomination of <i>Dolphin</i>, upon whose
Banks were whole Mulberry-Woods, which nourish’d Silk-Worms in strange
abundance. From hence he sail’d by the <i>Wolves Head</i> (a Point so call’d, because
great numbers of Wolves breed there) and leaving the <i>Cedar-Island</i>, landed on
<i>Florida</i>, where he built a Triangular Fort, and having furnish’d it with Men,
Guns, and Provisions, sail’d back for more Supplies to <i>France</i>; but coming thither,
found all things in disorder, occasion’d by a War amongst themselves;
so that the <i>French</i> which guarded and dwelt in the Fort, waited in vain for Relief,
and their Provisions growing scant, thought it fittest and their best way
to build a Vessel, and sail from thence; which having effected, and being
gone about the third part of their Voyage there hapned such a Calm for twenty
Days, that they made not the least way, which drove them to so great extremity,
their Provisions being spent, that they drank their own Urine, and fed
upon their old Shoes, which also in a short time failing, they agreed amongst
themselves to kill and eat one of their Sea-men, call’d <i>Henry Lacher</i>, on whose
Flesh they liv’d some days; but being again driven to the greatest want imaginable,
in this extremity of Desparation, their Condition being altogether
hopeless, an <i>English</i> Frigat discovering them, and observing by their manner of
Sailing that they were in some great want, drawing near, sent their Long-boat
aboard, and found them so weak, that they were not able to handle their
Tack; whereupon generously taking pity of them, they reliev’d them, and
conducted them to the Coast of England, and then brought them to Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>,
who had formerly design’d to rig a Fleet for <i>Florida</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Laudonier</i>’s Voyage.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable difference in the <i>French</i> Fleet.</div>

<p class='c010'>Mean while, no News having been heard of the foremention’d <i>French</i> Plantation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>in <i>Brasile</i>, and <i>Coligni</i>’s Difference with the King being decided, he prevail’d
so much, that <i>Renatus Laudonier</i> should with three Ships sail to relieve the
Garrison in the late deserted Fort. <i>Laudonier</i> landing in <i>Nova Francia</i>, found a
Stone with a <i>French</i> Inscription, plac’d on the Shore by <i>Ribald</i>, and hung full of
Laurel Garlands: Then he visited the King <i>Saturiona</i>, whose Son <i>Atorcus</i> had several
Children by his own Mother, according to a Salvage Custom observ’d in
that Countrey. Whilst they stay’d here, a Fiery Meteor appear’d in the Sky, with
such fervor, that some Rivers boyl’d with the heat of it, and the Fish parboyl’d,
died; nay more, it scorch’d all the Plants far and near: The Natives ascrib’d
this Plague to the <i>French</i> Cannons, by which means they stood in great fear
of the <i>French</i>, who might have done great things had not they differ’d
amongst themselves; For a Sea-man nam’d <i>Rubel Patracon</i>, pretending to
have skill in <i>Necromancy</i>, would undertake to shew the Places where the Gold
and Silver Mines were, which the rest of the Sea-men believing, rebell’d
against <i>Laudonier</i>, and though sick, imprison’d him, forcing him to sign a Writing
to this effect, That the two Ships, of which the Rebels made <i>Vassar</i> and
<i>Trincant</i> Commanders, should with his leave and permittance sail to <i>New Spain</i>
for Provisions. Whilst they were preparing for their Voyage, <i>Rupiferrir</i> having
been sent to the King <i>Utina</i>, came back with many rich Presents, and withal
brought Information of the Gold and Silver Mynes <i>Apalatica</i>; but <i>Vassar</i> and
<i>Trincant</i> taking no notice thereof, set forth, and took a <i>Spanish</i> Carvel, richly
laden before <i>Havana</i>, whose Commander they agreed to release on the payment
of a great Ransom; but the Masters Son being sent ashore to fetch the
Money which they had agreed for, in stead thereof, made his Fathers Mischance
known; whereupon two great Frigats and a Galley were the next Morning
very early sent to attaque the <i>French</i>, between whom was a sharp Encounter;
but in a short time the two Pyrats were sunk, and the Prisoners sold for Slaves,
excepting a few that escap’d in their Long-boat.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Great cruelty of the <i>Spaniards</i> against the <i>French</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Gurgie</i>’s valiant Exploits against the <i>Spaniards</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>In this interim <i>Laudonier</i> receiving no Supply from <i>France</i>, was brought to
great extremity; for the Rebels had carried great part of his Store with them.
In these straights he was forc’d by those that staid with him, contrary to the
Articles of Peace lately made with King <i>Utina</i>, to take him Prisoner, in hopes
that for his Liberty he would procure them some Provisions; but the Inhabitants
incens’d at the baseness of so unexpected an Action, could not be
wrought upon by any means to give them Relief; but grown more perverse
than before, appointed a general Meeting to elect another King; so that out of
all hopes, they utterly gave themselves over for lost. In this desperate condition,
<i>John Haukins</i>, a great Sea-Captain, came thither with four <i>English</i> Ships, who
pitying their misery, furnish’d them with Necessaries, and having onely four
Vessels, lent them one, because <i>Laudonier</i> was at that time too weak to endure
the Sea; but not long after recovering strength, and all things ready to set Sail,
<i>Ribald</i> came to an Anchor before <i>Charles-Fort</i>, with seven Ships from <i>Diep</i>:
Within few days after, the <i>Spanish</i> Admiral <i>Peter Melandez</i> arriv’d with eight
Frigats, whereof the French having Intelligence, cut their Cables, and stood
out to Sea, whom the <i>Spaniards</i> chac’d, but could not reach; whereupon leaving
them, they landed in the Mouth of the River <i>Dolphin</i>, where by help of
the <i>Moorish</i> Slaves they began to intrench themselves; of which <i>Ribald</i> having
notice, immediately sail’d thither, at least to disturb, if not absolutely
drive them from their Work; but surpriz’d in the way by a great Storm,
lost most of his Fleet, ingag’d among the Rocks; yet the Men were most of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>them sav’d. In this Storm the <i>Spaniards</i> also suffer’d great damage, yet made
an Advantage of the <i>Frenchmens</i> Misfortune, marching with all speed to <i>Charles-Fort</i>,
in which were onely two hundred weak Men, <i>Ribald</i> having taken the
primest Soldiers along with him. In the Morning before Sun-rise the <i>Spaniards</i>
made a fierce Assault, and in a short time became Masters of the Place, which
<i>Laudonier</i> seeing, fled in a Boat; others leaping from the Walls into the Moat,
sav’d themselves by swimming: Whoever fell into the Victors Hands, was
without mercy slain; nay, such was the <i>Spaniards</i> inveterate malice to the
<i>French</i>, that wanting living Bodies, they exercis’d their Cruelty upon the dead,
pulling out their Eyes, and cutting off their Members, carrying them in Triumph
on the Points of their Swords. In the interim, the Storm ceasing, <i>Ribald</i>
approach’d <i>Charles-Fort</i>, with his shatter’d Fleet, but was so amaz’d when
he saw the <i>Spanish</i> Flag set upon the Walls, and <i>Vallemond</i> marching towards
him with a Squadron of <i>Spaniards</i>, that although a River lay between them,
yet he presently came to a Treaty, and deliver’d up all his Men, being above
four hundred, upon promise of good Quarter; but the <i>Spaniards</i> in stead of
keeping their Agreement, bound them, leading them all to the Castle, where,
both against their Articles, and the Law of Arms, they massacred them, and
burnt their Bodies; but <i>Ribald</i> being quarter’d, they fix’d his Limbs upon
Poles about the Walls, sending his Head to <i>Sevil</i>. When <i>Charles</i> the Ninth,
King of <i>France</i>, receiv’d notice hereof, he was not in the least concern’d at the
<i>Spanish</i> Cruelty us’d to his Subjects, out of a particular hatred to <i>Coligni</i>, the
first Promoter of the Voyage. But though the <i>French</i> Crown so little regarded
the inhumane Usage committed by the <i>Spaniards</i> in <i>Charles-Fort</i>, yet <i>Dominicus
Gurgie</i> shew’d himself so highly concern’d thereat, that turning all his
Goods into Money, he levied two hundred Soldiers, and fourscore Sea-men,
which he put aboard three small Ships, pretending that he would onely touch
at <i>Brasile</i>; but sailing beyond <i>Cuba</i>, he stood directly for <i>Florida</i>, where after
his Landing he was kindly receiv’d by <i>Saturiona</i> the King, who complaining
much against the <i>Spaniards</i> Oppressions, sent to joyn with him his Kinsman
<i>Olotocara</i>, having the Command of a great Army.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Is ungratefully rewarded.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spaniards</i> by this time had not onely strengthned <i>Charles-Fort</i>, but also
rais’d two others on each side of the River <i>Mayo</i>, in which three Holds lay
Garrison’d above four hundred choice Soldiers. Those in the new Forts made
little resistance; but quitting the same, and flying into a neighboring Wood,
fell into an Ambuscade of <i>Indians</i>, who slew thirty of them, and preserv’d
ninety for a Publick Execution. Thus they march’d on victoriously to <i>Charles-Fort</i>,
where by the way sixty <i>Spaniards</i> sallying out, were every one cut off,
which much facilitated the <i>Frenchmens</i> Work. The Governor <i>Melandez</i>, seeing
a certain ruine attend him, fled into the Woods; but met there by the <i>Floridans</i>,
return’d to the <i>French</i>, of whom he begg’d Life for himself, and some of
his People: Yet <i>Gurgie</i> deaf to all intreaties, would hear nothing, but pressing
on, took them all Prisoners, and as a just Reward of their Cruelty to his
Countrey-men, hang’d them on the next Trees: After which Execution, it
can scarce be express’d how kindly the Natives entertain’d the <i>French</i>, because
they had freed the Countrey from the <i>Spanish</i> Oppressions. Thus having accomplish’d
his Design, and returning home, he was nobly receiv’d at <i>Rochel</i>,
but had not the least Countenance for all his trouble from the King; the Cardinal
of <i>Lorein</i> telling him, <i>That for his good Service he ought to suffer death, because
he had fitted out three Ships upon his own Account, without Authority</i>.</p>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><i>Forbisher</i>’s Expedition.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Captain <i>Forbisher</i> sailing to the Northern Parts of <i>America</i>, <i>Anno 1576.</i> chusing
a bad time, the Year being too much spent, and the Ocean so full of Ice,
that it forc’d him to return to <i>England</i>: Not many Months after, he renew’d
his Voyage, Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> having rigg’d out, and sent under his Command
one Frigat and two Ketches, Mann’d with a hundred and forty Men: The
twenty sixth of <i>May</i> he weigh’d Anchor, and sail’d to the <i>Orkenies</i>, lying to the
North of <i>Scotland</i>, where landing, he found the poor Islanders fled out of their
Huts, into Caves and Dens among the Rocks. From thence he steer’d North-North-West,
through abundance of floating Pieces of Timber, which oftentimes
gave him great stops. The fourth of <i>July</i> he made <i>Friezland</i>, where he
met with a great Storm of Hail, mix’d with Snow: Before the Shore lay a
great Ridge of Ice, which hindred for a while their Landing: Here he saw
several Wild People, but could not come to speak with them; for upon the
least approach they fled; yet when they saw any advantage, made resistance:
At last, three of them came unarm’d to the Shore, beckoning <i>Forbisher</i> to come
to them; which he had done, had not great numbers of the Natives appear’d
too soon from an Ambuscade in a Wood, and behind a Hill, who seeing themselves
discover’d, march’d up into the Countrey, three onely staying on the
Shore, of whom the middlemost feigning to be lame, at last fell down, whom
his Companions took up, and carried a little way, but then forsook, by which
the <i>English</i> observing their Design, shot that the Sand flew all about him;
whereupon forgetting his Lameness, he ran as swift as a Deer up a Hill.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Forbisher</i>’s Men had by this time fill’d two Barrels with a Mineral not unlike
Gold, but was afterwards found to be of little value. Nothing else of Remark
did he find here, except great long-hair’d Men, who being exceeding
salvage, subtilly plot nothing else but to murder, lurking for Men, like Wild
Beasts for their Prey, whom, when caught, they tear in pieces. Close fitted
to their Bodies, they wore the Skins of several Wild Beasts, priding in the
Tails which hung down betwixt their Legs. Their Tents are of conjoyn’d
Whalebones, cover’d over with the like Skins, the Entrance always facing the
South. They use Bowes, Arrows, Slings, and two sorts of Boats: In the biggest
they can carry seventeen Men, which are made of several Wooden Planks
clinch’d together, and cased on both sides with Leather: The smallest ones
are cover’d just in the same manner, much resembling a Weavers Shuttle, having
in the middle a Hole, wherein a Man sits, who drawing the Cover of the
Boat about his Waste by Strings, with one Oar makes swift Passage.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey it self is barren, yet feeds abundance of Deer, Hares, Wolves,
Bears, and Dogs like Wolves, whose Flesh serves the Inhabitants for Food.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey seems to be exceedingly troubled with great Earthquakes,
because several pieces of Rocks, and whole Mountains rent asunder, may be
seen in divers places.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fourth of <i>August</i>, <i>Forbisher</i> having elevated the Pole to sixty eight Degrees,
beyond what <i>Sebastian Cabot</i>, the first Discoverer of those Parts, and set
out by <i>Henry</i> the Seventh, had done (for <i>America</i> Northward never before had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>been so far penetrated) and laden with a sort of shining Sand, which he believ’d
might contain much of a Golden Oar, having with him three of the Natives,
<i>viz.</i> a Man, a Woman, and a Child, set Sail for <i>England</i>, and the seventh
of <i>September</i> came to <i>Milford</i>-Haven, and not long after arriv’d in <i>London</i>, where
in short time the Salvages died.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>’s Expedition.</div>

<p class='c010'>At the same time when <i>Forbisher</i> sail’d Northerly, Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> also, fitted
out by Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, steer’d another Course, sailing by <i>Cape Blanko</i> and <i>Cape
Verde</i>, along the <i>African</i> Coast, to <i>Brasile</i>, where he caught several Sea-Wolves, and
Anchoring in the River <i>La Plata</i>, furnish’d himself with Fresh Water: Then
proceeding on his Voyage through the crooked <i>Straights of Magellan</i>, he came
to an Anchor before <i>Moucha</i>, wash’d by the <i>South Sea</i>. The Islanders receiv’d
him very courteously, because they were inform’d that the <i>English</i> were at great
Wars with the <i>Spaniards</i>, to avoid whose Cruelties, they had deserted the main
Continent, and setled on <i>Moucha</i>. One of these <i>Mouchaners</i> going aboard, serv’d
them for a Pilot to the Haven <i>Valparizo</i>, where <i>Drake</i> burnt the <i>St. Jago</i>, a small
Village, and plundring all the Countrey about it, got together a great Treasure
of Gold and Silver. Before <i>Arica</i> he took three <i>Spanish</i> Ships, richly laden;
and before <i>Lima</i>, four more, having an unvaluable Treasure of Pearls
and Gold aboard them. Thus inrich’d, he steer’d his Course Northerly to
forty two Degrees; but the Cold forcing him to fall four Degrees to the Southward,
he discover’d a very pleasant and inhabited Coast, the People whereof
shew’d him great kindness: The King himself coming aboard with a great
Train, set a Crown of Gold upon <i>Drakes</i> Head, and gave him a Golden Scepter,
and an Ivory Chain. After this he inspected the Islands <i>Tidor</i>, <i>Ternata</i>,
<i>Java</i>, <i>Zeilon</i>, and <i>Cape de Bona Esperanza</i>, from whence, after a three Years Voyage,
having encompass’d the World, he came safe to <i>London</i>, where he rested
not long; for sailing <i>Anno 1585.</i> to <i>America</i>, he took great Prizes from the Cities
<i>St. Jago</i>, <i>St. Domingo</i>, <i>St. Augustin</i>, and <i>Carthagena</i>, setting them all on Fire.
Thus again returning home victoriously, and after the famous defeat of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span><i>Spanish Armado</i>, he rigg’d out a new Fleet, having for his Vice-Admiral Captain
<i>Hawkins</i>: Their Design was to have sail’d to <i>Panama</i>; but both dying,
and so the Commission ceasing, the expected great and golden Project also
died with them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Candish</i> his Expedition.</div>

<p class='c010'>A Year after the death of these famous Navigators, Captain <i>Thomas Candish</i>
Mann’d with a hundred and twenty Men, and Provisions for two Years, setting
sail in a lucky Hour, a second time encompass’d the World, passing the
<i>Straights of Magellan</i>; in which Voyage having got above ten times the value
of his Charge, by taking the <i>Spanish</i> Carrack <i>St. Anna</i>, valued at twenty Tun of
Gold; and at last freighted with a Mass of Treasure, he came safe into the
River of <i>Thames</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Smith</i>’s Voyage.</div>

<p class='c010'>But much worse success had Captain <i>John Smith</i>, who weigh’d Anchor <i>Anno
1614.</i> with two Ships, fitted out by several Merchants in <i>London</i>, for <i>New-England</i>,
and on the Island <i>Monachigga</i> to load Copper, Gold, and other Minerals
that were to be had there, and also to fish for Whales: But there were no such
Minerals to be found there, nor any Whales to be taken on the Coast, because
the time of the Year was past; so that he return’d home without Success.
However, not long after, they undertook the same Expedition a second time,
but with worse Fortune; for being gotten in sight of <i>Virginia</i>, he was treacherously
set upon, and taken by the <i>French</i>, who accus’d him, that he had destroy’d
the Plantations in <i>Nova Francia</i>, and unless he would make satisfaction
for the Damage, they threatned him with death. He was carried Prisoner to
<i>Rochel</i>, in a <i>French</i> Ship; but not far from thence surpris’d by a mighty Storm,
<i>Smith</i> finding an opportunity, leap’d into the Boat, and driving betwixt the
Waves, at last, half dead, was thrown upon the Island of <i>Oleron</i>, whom afterwards,
having lost all, an <i>English</i> Ship took in, and brought to his Native
Countrey.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Five Ships being fitted out at <i>Rotterdam</i>, the Command of them was given
to <i>Jaques Mahu</i> and <i>Simon de Cordes</i>, who on the twenty seventh of <i>June,
Anno 1598.</i> weigh’d Anchor from the <i>Goree</i>, and sail’d on an immense Voyage;
at last landing at the Island <i>St. Jago</i>, they won a strong Castle there, and took
two Barques; but at last Articled with the <i>Portuguese</i>, that they might undisturb’d
supply themselves with Fresh Water, yet they, as if they minded no
Agreements, whilst the <i>Dutch</i> were filling their Casks, came down upon them
with two hundred Horse, each having a Foot-Soldier behind him; but the
<i>Hollanders</i> made so stout resistance, that they put them all to flight.</p>

<p class='c010'>The City of <i>St. Jago</i>, which gives Denomination to the whole Island, is built
long-wise, having a convenient Haven, like a Crescent: Through the City
glides a River, on both sides of which, beyond the Town, arise several high
Mountains: That part which faces the Sea, hath Fortifications, defended with
strong Bulwarks. The <i>Portuguese</i> had brought all their Guns to bear towards
the Sea, to sink the <i>Holland Ships</i>, which they invited thither under pretence of
kindness; but a great Storm hindred the Fleet, that they could not Anchor
at the appointed place; onely two of the Ships sail’d pretty near, but not
within Shot.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>From hence steering to the Desolate Island <i>Brava</i>, they saw nothing but five
ruin’d Houses, the Door of one stopp’d up with great Stones, which being
taken away, was found full of <i>Turkish</i> Wheat, which prov’d a great kindness
to the Sea-men.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Mahu</i> dies.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cordes</i> his Voyage.</div>

<p class='c010'>Mean while the Admiral <i>Mahu</i> died, and his Body put into a Chest fill’d up
with Stones, was thrown over-board; so that <i>Simon des Cordes</i> carrying the
Flag, steer’d his Course to <i>Guinee</i>, there to refresh himself; for most of his
Men were so weakned by the Scurvey, that they were scarce able to hand the
Sails.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange King in <i>Guinee</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Arriving at their intended Port, the Sick were carried ashore; and the
Vice-Admiral <i>Beuningen</i>, being conducted by a <i>French</i> Guide, went to the Vice-Roy
of that Countrey, who sat on a low Bench, with a Sheeps-skin under his
Feet, in a Violet-colour’d Cloth Suit, without any Linnen, Shirt, Shoes, or
Stockins; on his Head a Cap made of yellow, red, and blue Eastern Cloth;
his Face whitened with Ashes, shew’d in several places its natural blackness, appearing
through the Colours; about his Neck a Collar or Chain of Glass
Beads: Behind him sat his Nobles, with Cocks Feathers on their Heads, and
their Skins painted Red.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Beuningen</i> plac’d by the King on a Mat, complain’d to him, That the <i>Guineans</i>
fled from him where-ever he came, though in Friendship, to barter <i>European</i>
Commodities with them, against Fruits, Poultrey, Sheep, and other Provisions:
Whereupon the King promis’d to furnish him therewith, and invited
<i>Beuningen</i> to Dinner. After some stay, the Kings Wives entred the Palace, a
very mean and ill-favour’d Building, more like a great Barn than a Kings
House, and plac’d a kind of nasty Trough on the Ground, in which lay nothing
but some wild Herbs, and a piece of a smoak’d Sea-Calf; and though
he was a Person of the largest size, and corpulent, yet he eat sparingly. <i>Beuningen</i>,
though exceeding hungry, found little rellish in such kind of Meats;
wherefore spreading a Napkin, his Attendants brought him some Bisket and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span><i>Spanish</i> Wine, whereof after the King had tasted, he lik’d so well the rellish,
that it rock’d him asleep, whilst <i>Beuningen</i> walk’d to the Sea-side to refresh himself;
but the <i>Guineans</i> coming about him, he was forc’d to return to the
King, who waking at the noise, appear’d highly incens’d at his People, and
took <i>Beuningen</i> into his House: However the Subjects, notwithstanding
the Kings Commands, when <i>Beuningen</i> was sent into a neighboring Hut, kept
Watch about it all Night: The next Morning early an old Woman entred,
muttering to her self, and went out and in to <i>Beuningen</i> three times one after
another, knocking on a Box not unlike a Pair of Bellows, out of which flew
abundance of Dust about <i>Beuningen</i>, which caus’d a great Laughter amongst
the <i>Guineans</i>. The King also coming to him, presented him with two Goats,
and four Hens, and so conducted him back to the Ships.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Bloody Sea, very strange.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Salvages in the <i>Straights of Magellan</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Beuningen</i> seeing that there was no good to be done, set sail from thence, and
coming before the River <i>La Plata</i> in <i>America</i>, it appear’d Blood-red. Out of
the Water which was taken up in Buckets, started a sort of Insects like
Fleas, which caus’d a strange and sad Distemper amongst the Sea-men, that
when any Meat was offer’d to them, so soon as ever they put it to their
Mouths, they would fall down backwards in a swoon, foaming and frothing
at the Mouth, and turning up the White of their Eyes, die distracted. Suffering
under this Disaster, they hasted from thence with all speed, and sailing into the
<i>Straights of Magellan</i> they kill’d above fourteen hundred <i>Penguyins</i>,  which is a
Bird that preys on Fish, and lives in Holes under Ground; they somewhat resemble
a Goose, onely they stand more upright, and are double-crested, with
two plumy Combs. Coming to an Anchor in the <i>Green-Bay</i>, there arose a great
Storm, which continued several days, so that they were forc’d to moor their
Vessels with four Anchors, extremely afflicted both with Hunger and Cold,
preserving themselves alive by eating young Grout, at that time not above a
span high from the Ground; but this course Food bred an incurable Dropsie,
that posted them on to a sudden death. Afterwards, when the Weather grew
more pleasant, the Inhabitants being Gyants, most of them eleven Foot high,
grew more troublesom, oftentimes assailing them, and throwing Darts pointed
like Harping-Irons, at which they were very expert. Their Salvage Natures
may appear by their Dealings with the dead <i>Hollanders</i>, cutting off their Heads,
and bruising them to pieces, sticking Darts through their Hearts, and cutting
off their Privities.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A wild Woman.</div>

<p class='c010'>At last the Fleet getting into the <i>South Sea</i>, were by stress of Weather separated
one from another: Two Ships, being the <i>Faith</i>, and the <i>Good Tydings</i>,
were driven back into the <i>Straights of Magellan</i>, where they suffer’d the uttermost
extremity of Hunger: Here they took a wild Woman, and two Children,
who being of a sallow Complexion, had a great hanging Belly, a wide
Mouth, crooked Legs, long Heels, and Breasts like Cows Udders; about her
Neck a String of Snail-shells, and upon her Back a Beasts Skin, fastned about
her Neck with the Sinews of it; her Food nought else but live Fowls: The
same Diet the Children fed upon: The youngest being but six Months old,
had his Mouth full of Teeth, and ran without any help: The eldest they carried
to <i>Amsterdam</i>; but having kept the Woman aboard two Nights, they gave
her several Trifles, and set her ashore. Here they found old Ice in the middle
of Summer, four Foot thick.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Beuningen</i> lingred in the <i>Straights of Magellan</i>, and being tired out with
Hunger, Cold, and Storms, return’d home; and had they not by accident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>taken abundance of Coneys, they had all perish’d. Above two Years had this
unhappy Voyage lasted, when they arriv’d at their Native Countrey, with six
and thirty Men, being all that remain’d alive of a hundred and five.</p>

<h4 id='c113' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. XVI.</span><br /> <i>The Expedition of</i> Oliver van Noord.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><i>Porto Desire.</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Sea-Dogs.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Two Months after <i>Mahu</i>, <i>Oliver Van Noord</i> set sail with four Ships, and two
hundred forty eight Men, from the <i>Maes</i>. Having reach’d the <i>Princes
Island</i>, he lost seven of his Men by the Treachery of the <i>Portuguese</i>; and Anchoring
before the City <i>Javeiro</i>, he was no better entertain’d by the same Nation:
Here having a Rencounter, and both Sides receiving considerable
Loss, he steer’d for St. <i>Sebastian</i>, a fruitful Island, producing an Herb very
wholesom against the <i>Scurvey</i>: Here the Sea-men found great store of Sea-Mews,
and Parrots, besides several sorts of delicious Fish. The approaching
Winter advis’d them from entring the <i>Straights of Magellan</i> so late; wherefore
they judg’d it best to seek a convenient Harbor, to put their Sick ashore to refresh
themselves. The Island <i>St. Hellen</i>, for its fruitfulness, seem’d to be the
most convenient for this purpose; but a great Storm preventing them, they
came to <i>St. Clara</i>, where taking in Fresh Water, they cast Anchor in <i>Porto Desire</i>.
In this Haven they saw a kind of Sea-Dogs, whose fore-parts being overgrown
with long Hair, seem’d like a Lyon, and the Feet like Mens Hands;
over their Eyes and Upper-lips grew black and white Hair, which in Stormy
Weather stands staring upright, but in Calm, lies flat and smooth; they Urine
backwards, sleep very soundly, and cast their Young every Month: Their
Flesh well-boyl’d prov’d a savory Dish.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Tombs.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Van Noord</i> going ashore here, saw not a Man; but only Burying-places on
high Rocks, built of red Stones, and adorn’d both within and without with
Bowes, Arrows, and other strange things: Under the Heads of the Dead lay
four-square Shells, and other things artificially carv’d. Curiosity made them
desirous to make a further search into the Countrey; wherefore he rowed during
a whole Tide up a River; and when their Boat ran aground at the
time of Ebb, he walk’d several Leagues up into the Countrey, where he saw
nothing but Deer, Buffles, and Ostriches: and because he saw no People, he
judg’d the Coast to be uninhabited; but returning again, he found it otherwise;
for the Sea-men, though commanded to stay in the Boat, which lay in
the middle of the River, went ashore, where they were so fiercely set upon by
thirty of the Natives, that three of them were kill’d, and another wounded
in the Leg. These People are very strong and Salvage, with painted Faces, and
long Hair; but after this Encounter, they saw no more of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>But <i>Van Noord</i> having spent fourteen Months in search, and lost a hundred
Men, set sail again with three Ships; for one of them, being the <i>Unity</i>, he
burnt at the Island <i>Clara</i>, where he Winter’d, because of a great Leak which
could not be stopp’d. Here they brought five thousand Fowls aboard, which
much increased their Stock of Provisions.</p>

<p class='c010'>From hence parting the Wide Ocean, into the <i>Straights of Magellan</i>, four times
the Fleet attempted to go into the <i>South-Sea</i>, and was as often driven back by
cross Weather into the <i>Straights</i>; but the fifth time prov’d more successful;
for having got through, and left the <i>Straights</i> a handsom way astern, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>discover’d two Islands, from one of which the Sea-men going aland, brought
four Boys and two Girls; who afterward instructed in their Tongue, inform’d
them concerning the scituation of the Countreys thereabout.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Philip-Stadt</i> forsaken through famine.</div>

<p class='c010'>After that, the Fleet Sail’d into <i>Hungers Haven</i>, where they found the ruines
of the deserted <i>Philip-Stadt</i>, which Captain <i>Thomas Candish</i> had seen fourteen
years before, fortifi’d with four Bulwarks; but now onely some Houses, a
Church, and a Gibbet were standing: Four hundred <i>Spaniards</i> built that City,
as a Key to the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>. But all their Provisions being spent in
three years time, and no relief coming from <i>Spain</i>, and what they Sow’d expecting
the hopes of a Harvest, the Salvages coming down by night destroy’d;
which caus’d so great a Famine to rage amongst them, that many
dy’d, not so much as putting off their Clothes, who lying in the Houses unbury’d,
occasion’d such a stench in the City, that the remainder fled into the
Field; where they liv’d a whole year by the Fruits of the Trees, Herbs, and
Roots: At last, three and twenty of them, amongst which were two Women
remaining yet alive, resolv’d to travel to the River <i>La Plata</i> and accordingly
set forward, but what became of them could never yet be heard, only one
<i>Ferdinando</i> that was of that company, accidentally wandring from the rest,
happen’d to light upon <i>Candish</i>’s Fleet.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Mocha</i>, what kind of Island.</div>

<p class='c010'>Here <i>Van Noord</i> set on Shore the Vice-Admiral <i>Jacob Claeszoon Ilpendam</i>, for
some crimes which he had committed; and leaving him behind, Sail’d from
thence thorow the South-Sea along the Coast of  <i>Chili</i> and <i>Mocha</i>; which Island,
of a considerable bigness, rises in the middle with a forked Mountain, from
which a convenient River comes flowing down into the Countrey.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cica</i>, a strange Drink.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Inhabitants conducted the <i>Hollanders</i> to their Village, consisting of
about fifty Houses built of Straw, but were forbid to go into their Huts: Upon
the Mens call the Women appear’d, which being divided into three parties,
humbly kneel’d down before them; and soon after an old Woman
brought an Earthen Can full of <i>Cica</i>, a Liquor made of <i>Mays</i>, whose extracted
Juyce, boyl’d and put into Tubs, ferments like our Beer or Ale, with a
cap of Barm, with which they treated the <i>Hollanders</i>, who drinking moderately,
were well refresh’d; but the Natives will ply this Liquor, till they make
themselves Distracted, and are mad Drunk.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Van Noord</i> takes a <i>Spanish</i> Ship.</div>

<p class='c010'>From hence <i>Van Noord</i> steer’d his course to <i>Sancta Maria</i>, where in his way
he took a <i>Spanish</i> Ship, call’d <i>Buon Jesus</i>, that is, <i>Good Jesus</i>, and receiv’d intelligence
from the Prisoners, that the Admiral <i>Simon de Cordes</i>, with twenty three
Men was kill’d by the <i>Americans</i> on the Promontory <i>Lavapia</i>, being the head
Land or Point opposite to <i>St. Maries</i>; that a year since, tydings were brought to
<i>Lima</i> of his Fleet; so that they had made all things ready to withstand him.
But <i>Van Noord</i> hinder’d by strong contrary Winds, not able to reach <i>Sancta Maria</i>,
stood directly for <i>St. Jago</i>, in whose Haven lay a great <i>Spanish</i> Ship full of
<i>Indians</i>, and two other going in, which two he set on Fire, and the third he
Tow’d towards his Fleet; repenting extremely that he had given liberty, and
set <i>Francisco de Ivarro</i> Commander of the <i>Buon Jesus</i> ashore; because he afterwards
understood from the <i>Spanish</i> Pilot, that  <i>Ivarra</i> threw ten thousand two
hundred pound weight of Gold, pack’d in fifty two Cases, over-board, when
he observ’d that he was like to loose his Ship.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Fleet Sailing forward came to an Anchor before the <i>Thieves-Island</i>, whose
Inhabitants are very light Finger’d, go stark naked, and are of great strength;
they found the Women much Disfigur’d, their Noses, Lips, and Cheek-bones
eaten by the <i>French</i> Pox.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Performs great things.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the Bay <i>La Baya</i>, the <i>Dutch</i> Admiral, with a <i>Spanish</i> Flag on his top-Mast,
sent one of his Sea-men in a Fryers garb ashore, if possible under that disguise,
to get Provisions; which falling out according to their Design, they were supply’d
with all manner of Victuals: After that, the <i>Hollanders</i> burnt five Villages
on the Island <i>Capull</i>; took a <i>Chinesy</i> Vessel, one <i>Spanish</i> Barque, and a <i>Carvel</i>
Laden with Brandy from <i>Cocos</i>; and after a great and bloody Fight sunk the
Admiral of the <i>Manilla</i>’s, and so at last with various fortunes arriv’d at <i>Rotterdam</i>,
having in three years encompass’d the World.</p>

<h4 id='c115' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. XVIa.</span><br /> <i>The Expedition</i> of George Van Spilbergen.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'><i>Anno 1614.</i> the eighth of <i>August</i>, the <i>East-India</i> Company of the <i>United Netherlands</i>
set out seven Ships under the Command of <i>George Spilbergen</i>, who
coming to <i>Cape St. Vincent</i>, and engaging with the <i>Portuguese</i>, took one of their
Ships, and so proceeded on his Voyage to the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>, but by a
huge Storm, the Fleet was separated. Amongst those that were scatter’d was
the good Ship call’d <i>Meruw</i>, in which some of the crew had conspir’d to have
kill’d the Master, and seiz’d the Vessel; but he having some inkling thereof,
set so stoutly upon two of the chief Contrivers with his drawn Hanger, that he
forc’d them to leap over-board, and as stoutly ordering the rest, set all to
rights.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Corps.</div>

<p class='c010'>But <i>Spilbergen</i> Landing on one of the <i>Penguyn</i> Islands, found two Dead Bodies
just cover’d with Earth, about their Necks was a Chain of glistering Snail
Shells neatly strung; the Grave stuck full of Bowes and Arrows, was pleasant
to look upon, between several high Mountains, whose tops lay bury’d in Snow:
The Fleet came out of the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>, but not without great danger,
for the South-Sea much disturb’d by tempestuous Weather, seem’d to raise its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Waves up to the Sky, so that they had enough to do, from being ingag’d
among the Rocks: But at last with great difficulty, wonderfully escaping all
danger, they Anchor’d before <i>La Mocha</i>, an Island which on the North side lies
low, and on the South defended by Rocks.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Spilbergen</i> in great danger.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange sheep.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Spilbergen</i> seeing abundance of Men standing on the Shore, Row’d thither to
Barter for Merchandize, amongst them was a Sheep with a long Neck, bunch-Back’d
like a Camel, a little Mouth, and long Legs; which Beast serves them
in stead of Horses, to carry their burthens, and perform their Tillage. The
<i>Americans</i> breed up these Sheep every where, by reason of the extraordinary benefit
they receive from them, some of them keeping no less than eighteen hundred.
Their Shepherds ride upon a Beast almost like an Ox, and carry in their
hands Copper-plates, hung round about with Bells, which they shake, making
a different noise when their Sheep shall go in or out; and on their Heads
wear Feathers like Coronets, standing upright.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>St. <i>Maries</i> burnt.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>And also <i>Val Parysa</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>From thence, <i>Spilbergen</i> departing, Landed at last on the Island of <i>St. Mary</i>,
where he burnt all the <i>Spanish</i> Villages; as he did also in <i>Val Parysa</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>After going ashore, in the Haven <i>Quintero</i>, he saw abundance of Wild Horses
drinking out of a Rivulet, supply’d with fresh Water from an adjoyning steep
Mountain; so soon as they espy’d Men, they instantly running away, were
seen no more.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Bloody fight between the <i>Hollanders</i> and <i>Spanish</i> Fleet.</div>

<p class='c010'>Having left <i>Quintero</i>, and spent a Moneth in Sailing farther, they discry’d
eight great Ships; whereupon the Prisoners inform’d them, that it was
the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet, of which <i>Roderigo de Mendoza</i> was Admiral, fitted out on purpose
to fight <i>Spilbergen</i>, whose coming (as we said) was known a year before.
At midnight <i>Mendoza</i> Boarded <i>Spilbergen</i>, but was so roughly receiv’d, that he
was forc’d to Retreat with the loss of the Ship <i>St. Francisco</i>. At Day-break, the
<i>Holland</i> Admiral fir’d at <i>Mendoza</i>, who answering with equal courage, occasion’d
a smart Engagement, wherein the <i>Spaniards</i> were so hard beset, that
they put forth a White Flag; but it was immediately taken in again by the
Commanders aboard, choosing rather to die, than surrender, because they
had mock’d at <i>Mendoza</i>, when he hinted the difficulty of the Enterprize in the
Grand <i>Peruvian</i> Councel, saying, <i>They went out, onely to take a few disabled</i> Hollanders,
<i>and tying them hand and feet, carry them to Execution</i>. Yet their high and
proud Stomachs prov’d very fatal to them, for afterwards totally routed and
put to flight, most of them sunk by the way.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Calyow de Lima.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>This done, the <i>Hollanders</i> victoriously Sail’d to <i>Calyow de Lima</i>, having a convenient
Haven: The City adorn’d with curious Houses and Temples, is
strengthen’d by a Platform, Planted with great Guns towards the Sea, and the
Shore was guarded by eight Troops of Horse, and four thousand Foot; whereupon
<i>Spilbergen</i>, who was yet to go so great a Voyage, judg’d it no way convenient
to adventure the loss of all on the good or bad event of a Battel, especially
being so much over-power’d by the number of the Enemy: Wherefore
seeing no hopes of Victory, setting forward to <i>Guarma</i>, he got some fresh Provisions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Peyta</i> burnt.</div>

<p class='c010'>Against the City <i>Peyta</i>, he play’d his Cannon with such fury, that the Townsmen
deserted the place, which he observing, set it on fire, and Sail’d to <i>Aquapulque</i>,
where from the Fort at first the <i>Spaniards</i> fired some Guns at them; but
soon after changing humor, they came to an Accommodation, furnishing the
<i>Hollanders</i> with convenient Provisions. Passing on, and coming to <i>Selaques</i>, both
Natives and <i>Spaniards</i> having suffer’d some of the <i>Hollanders</i> to Land; after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>set upon them treacherously in a Thicket, but to their little advantage, for
they made so good a Defence, that the Assailants not able to bear the brunt,
fled with great loss.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Spilbergen</i> Sailing from hence to the <i>Manilla</i>’s, waited there for the <i>Spanish</i> Admiral
<i>Juan de Silva</i>, who had made (as was reported) great preparations for him
long since; but seeing it was in vain, at last he return’d to <i>Zealand</i> where he
came to an Anchor, loaden with Riches, in the middle of Summer, <i>Anno
1617.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Horn.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Some Merchants that were call’d the <i>Austrian</i> Company, fitted out one
Ship with sixty five, and a Ketch with two and twenty Sea-men, giving
the Command thereof to the Captains <i>Schouten</i> and <i>Le Maire</i>: <i>Anno 1615.</i> they
Weigh’d Anchor from the <i>Texel</i>; the first took a view of one of the three
Islands, call’d <i>Mabrabomma</i>, lying before <i>Cape Sierra Leona</i>. This Island appearing
a great height out of the Sea, was not inhabited, they seeing onely three
Wild Buffles, many Wild Cats, Birds which bark’d like Dogs, Wild Palm-Trees,
Lemon-Trees, Turtles, Crocodiles, Partridges, and Storks: From
hence, passing by the dangerous Shelf <i>Abrolhos</i>, they ran into <i>Porto Desire</i>, where
on the Rocks they found abundance of Eggs, and Spierings, or Smelts, and Spiregrass
sixteen Inches long, wherefore they call’d that Inlet <i>Spierings-Bay</i>. Their
Sloop also brought two Sea-Lions, and one hundred and fifty <i>Penguins</i> from
the <i>Penguin</i> Isles, having Sail’d two Leagues up the River; in the interim, the
ground being meer Stone, and their Anchors coming home, the great Ship
drove against a Rock, and at Ebbing Water, broke off the outermost Planks
and Iron-Work, and the Ketch also striking on a high Shelf, was at low Ebb
two Fathom with her Keel above the Water, and had without peradventure
been overset, and bilg’d, but a fresh North-West Wind kept her upright, yet
at last, the Weather growing calm, she lean’d, but the Tide coming in very fast,
set her afloat, so that she was miraculously sav’d; then setting Sail again to
<i>King’s-Island</i>, they found so many Eggs of black <i>Mews</i>, that one without stirring
from his place, might reach above fifty Nests, and in each of them at least
three Eggs, which they carry’d aboard by thousands. Their Boat Rowing
Southerly down the River, found some Ostriches, and Beasts not unlike Stags,
but with exceeding long Necks. On the Hills lay Stones heap’d one upon another,
which removing, they found Dead Bodies of eleven Foot long; here
they spent their time in cleansing their Ships, and new Sheathing the Ketch,
but as they were Tallowing, the Flame accidentally got between the Crevisses
which immediately taking Fire, in a short time consum’d it to Ashes: The
great Ship had gotten a Horn in her Bow, seven Foot under Water; this Horn
being firm without any hollowness, and not unlike a great Elephants Tooth,
struck thorow two Ashen and one Oaken Plank, sticking in a Rib of the like
Wood, and yet above half a Foot remain’d out to be seen.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Great Mews.</div>

<p class='c010'>At length <i>Schouten</i> Weighing Anchor from <i>Porto Desire</i>, and Sailing to four
and fifty Degrees Southern Latitude, met whole Shoals of Whales, insomuch,
that he was fain to Tacque to and again to shun them. Sea-Pies, bigger than
Swans, came flying in great numbers aboard, suffering themselves to be taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>with the hand. On the North-side they spy’d a high and scraggy Coast spreading
it self to the East South-East, which they call’d, The <i>States Countrey</i>, that
which lay to the Westward of it, <i>Maurice</i> of <i>Nassau</i>, the Islands in fifty seven
Degrees <i>Barnevield</i>’s Isles, and the sharp Point in which lay the Snowy Mountains,
Southward of the <i>Magellan Straights</i> end, the <i>Cape</i> of <i>Hoorn</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Straights Le Maire.</i></div>

<p class='c010'><i>Schouten</i> had now gotten the height of fifty nine Degrees, when he enter’d
the South-Sea, through the new passage between <i>Mauritius</i> and the <i>States-Countrey</i>,
which was call’d from his Partner, <i>The Straights of Le Maire</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Isles in the South-Sea.</div>

<p class='c010'>Near the two Isles <i>Juan Fernando</i>, they found great store of Fish, after that
they view’d these Islands, that lay scatter’d up and down the South-Sea, each
of them they nam’d according to their several occasions, calling the first, <i>The
Isle of Dogs</i>, because they have abundance of Dogs there that could not bark:
Another, <i>The Bottomless Island</i>, because the Sea was so deep about it, that they
could not come to an Anchor. The Inhabitants who go naked, with their
Skins pounced full of strange shapes, of blue Snakes, Dragons, and such like
Creatures, Salli’d out of the Woods upon the <i>Hollanders</i> with great Clubs, to
which was fasten’d the Sword or Snout of a Sword-Fish, and also with
Slings.</p>

<p class='c010'>Somewhat further they came to <i>Water-Land</i>, and <i>Flyes-Island</i>, the first so
nam’d, because the Shore round about was planted with Trees, but in the
middle all lay cover’d with Salt-Water; the other from the <i>Flyes</i>, which with
incredible numbers troubled the Sea-men four days together.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange entertainment at the Horn Islands.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, the Reception or Entertainment which <i>Schouten</i> was welcom’d
withal, at the <i>Hoorn-Islands</i>, being very remarkable, we will in brief relate:</p>

<p class='c010'>Anchoring in nine Fathom Water, Shelly ground, before a fresh Rivulet,
three <i>Hollanders</i> sent to the King were by him courteously entertain’d, who
with strange humility, not bow’d, but kissing their Feet fell flat on the ground,
and put the <i>Hollanders</i> Feet upon his Neck; and after this manner of Salutation,
waited upon them aboard: Yet although this King fawn’d so much, and
seem’d so humble, yet he was very severe over his Subjects, for finding one
that had filch’d a Sword, he not onely brought and restor’d it, but immediately
Executed the Thief before their Faces.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Le Maire</i> and <i>Arias Claeszoon</i> were much honor’d here, for the old and young
King put their Crowns on their Heads, curiously Wrought of fine White Feathers,
and the end adorn’d with small Red and Green Feathers; they gave also
to each of them a Pigeon, White to their Wings, the hinder part Black, and
under their Bellies Red.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the interim, the King of <i>Water-Island</i> visited the other, by whom <i>Le Maire</i>
was treated: When they met, they made strange shews of Honor to each other,
but at last shew’d their Salvageness by eating raw Fish, and rudely Dancing
before the <i>Hollanders</i>. <i>Le Maire</i> going into the Countrey, and climbing up a
high Mountain, saw nothing but Morass Wilds, and Vallies, lying under
Water: The King and his Retinue here kept him company, during his stay
there, when weary with walking, they sate down together under Coco-Nut-Trees;
the young King tying a String about his Leg, climb’d with exceeding
dexterity up a high Tree, bringing several Coco-Nuts down with him, which
he open’d very expeditiously.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Arias Claeszoon</i>, Rowing ashore one night, found the King sitting under a
Roof, resting on four Pillars, where several Naked Women Danc’d before
him according to their Musick, which was Taboring upon a hollow Piece of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Wood, which yielded a murmuring sound without any distinct Tune.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_135.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cava</i> a strange Liquor.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Impudent Women.</div>

<p class='c010'>But the two Kings meeting again, the next day Complemented one another
with more antick and ridiculous Postures, sitting side by side under the
Roof, imploring their God, with their Hands folded, and their Heads bow’d
to the ground: At this interview, four <i>Holland</i> Trumpeters and Drummers
stood playing before the King, to the great admiration and amazement of the
Islanders, which were near ten thousand gather’d together upon the News of
the strangers to attend the two Kings. Soon after a great company of Rusticks
came running thither, which had a green Herb call’d <i>Cava</i>, ty’d about their
middle; on a sudden they began all to chaw this <i>Cava</i>, throwing that which
they had chaw’d into a large Woodden Trough, then putting Water to it, they
Kneaded it together; which done, brought the Liquor on their Heads to the
two Kings, before whom they kneel’d when they gave them any: Yet notwithstanding
they receiv’d such honor from their Subjects, they shew’d servile
respects to the <i>Hollanders</i>, for every King presented them with a Pig, which
they first laid on their Heads, then kneeling, put it down at <i>Le Maire</i>’s Feet,
and bowing their Heads to the ground, rose again. They wear their Hair
long, which Brayded, hung on the left side of their Heads down to their Hips,
ty’d at the end with two Knots; but the Nobility had two such Locks: All
of them went naked, their Privities onely cover’d. The smallest of the Men
exceeded the biggest of the <i>Hollanders</i> in tallness. The Women had long Breasts
hanging like Satchels down to their Bellies, and so unshamefac’d, that they prostituted
themselves to any, in sight of all Men; and still at low Water, their
business was to catch Fish, which they greedily eat raw.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange wild men.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Deform’d people.</div>

<p class='c010'>After all this Entertainment, Weighing from hence, <i>Schouten</i> Sail’d along
the Coast of <i>New-Guiny</i>, where three Boats full of <i>Negro</i>’s came Rowing towards
them, Slinging very fiercely Stones at them, and hovering about,
attended their motion all night. Next morning, seven Boats more coming to
their assistance, they set upon the <i>Hollanders</i>, but soon fled from their Bullets;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>yet two of the <i>Negro</i>’s were taken, that in each Nostril wore a Ring. Sailing
further, several Boats came aboard of them, whereof those that Row’d, breaking
their <i>Assagays</i> or Launces over their Heads, enter’d the Ship; the Hair of
their Heads and Beards bedawb’d with Lime, flew about, whilst they Danc’d
on the Decks, after they had eaten a good Meal: But they endeavor’d to reward
this their kind Entertainment with Treachery, for going ashore, they
soon after return’d in greater numbers, and sat upon the Anchors which lay
over the Bows of the Ship, and there being a great calm, endeavor’d to Towe
the Ship towards the Shore, whilst others threw Stones and Arrows. But so
soon as the <i>Hollanders</i> firing their Guns Wounded several of them, they all
fled, except some which they took Prisoners, whereof one whom they afterwards
call’d <i>Moses</i>, did them great service.</p>

<p class='c010'>But <i>Le Maire</i> was amaz’d at nothing more, than when on the next Coast he
saw several little Houses built about nine Foot high, out of which many People
issu’d, which were all deform’d, either having Wry Noses, Bow Legs,
Squint Eyes, or crooked Backs, and all in one part or another mis-shapen.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last, Anchoring before <i>Jacatra</i>, the Ship was stopt there by order of the
<i>East-India</i> Company, and the Men divided and put aboard those Ships that
Sail’d from <i>India</i> to <i>Holland</i>, and arriv’d in safety at <i>Flushing</i>, after they had Sail’d
about the World, in two years and eighteen days.</p>

<h4 id='c120' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect.  XVIII.</span><br /> <i>Voyage of the</i> Nassavian <i>Fleet, under the Command of</i> Jaques L’Heremite, <i>and</i> Geen Huigo Schapenham.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable Exploits of <i>L’Hermite</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The <i>United Netherlands</i>, to abate the <i>Spanish</i> Greatness, set out a considerable
Fleet, which they sent to try their fortune, in making Prize of what
ever they could light upon in any of their Havens wash’d by the South-Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Jaques L’Hermite</i> had ten Ships under his Command, Mann’d with sixteen
hundred thirty seven Men, and two hundred ninety four Brass and Iron Guns,
with which he set Sail from <i>Goree</i>, <i>Anno 1623.</i> and coming before <i>Cape Vincent</i>,
he discover’d eleven <i>Turkish</i> Pirates, whom fighting, he beat, and re-took the
<i>Holland</i> Ships they had made Prize of.</p>

<p class='c010'>At <i>Roxents Head</i>, <i>L’Hermite</i> gave chase to fifteen <i>Spanish</i> Ships, and coming
up with them, sunk eleven, and took four laden with Sugar. Afterwards Anchoring
at <i>Safia</i>, he sent the Ship <i>Over-yssel</i>, and a Frigat call’d the <i>Gray-Hound</i>,
to Convoy home the Prizes; afterward being inform’d, that thirty <i>Spanish</i>
Ships were making to them, Sailing into the Haven <i>St. Vincent</i>, the Spring Water
that he supply’d his empty Cask with being brakkish, caus’d an excoriation
of the Guts, which brought the Bloody-Flux, whereby he lost many of his
Sea-men; being well entertain’d by the Salvages of <i>Antonio</i>, they went on to
<i>Sierra Leona</i>, a Mountainous Point full of Lime-Trees, here they found the
Names of <i>Sr. Francis Drake</i>, and other <i>English</i> cut in a Rock.</p>

<p class='c010'>After that he put in at the fruitful Island <i>Annabon</i>, where he caus’d his Chirurgeon
to be Beheaded.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Vegar</i> a wicked man.</div>

<p class='c010'>This wicked Man being brought to the Torture, would confess nothing
concerning the Crimes objected against him, but being strip’d for Execution,
they found a small Bag hanging on his Breast, in which lay a Serpents Skin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>and Tongue, with which he had Poyson’d several Men, but he confess’d nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first of <i>February</i>, the Fleet came to <i>Cape de Pemias</i>, which they know at a
great distance, by its high Mountains cover’d with Snow.</p>

<p class='c010'>In short time after, Sailing by the Mouth of the <i>Straights</i> of <i>La Maire</i>, they
met with very tempestuous Weather, and seventeen of their Men going ashore,
were devour’d by the <i>Cannibals</i> of <i>Terra del Fuogo</i>. These People being all <i>Whites</i>,
and of a large Stature, Paint themselves Red, and go stark naked, except some
of highest quality who tie a Deer Skin about their Necks; and the Women cover
their Nakedness with a piece of Leather: They live in Bowers made of
the Branches of Trees, Stak’d three Foot deep, in a round at bottom, and above
like our Tents, Canopy’d, the top of which open, to carry out the Smoke like
a Chimney; and have no other Houshold-stuff than some Baskets, in which
they lay their few Fishing Implements. They go continually Arm’d with Clubs,
Arrows, Slings, and Stone-Knives: Their Boats being only the Trunk of a
Tree made hollow, rise up before and behind like a Half-Moon, and are fourteen,
and some sixteen Foot long, and two broad, and Row swifter than a
Pinnace with many Oars. Lastly, they are so Salvage, that they seem rather
to be Beasts than Men, knowing no Religion, ill Natur’d, cruel and Treacherous.</p>

<p class='c010'>From hence, passing on, <i>L’Hermite</i> refresh’d at the desolate Isle <i>Fernando</i>, and
so Steer’d his Course to <i>Calla de Lima</i>, on whose Coast, taking a <i>Spanish</i> Vessel,
the Prisoners told him, that their Plate-Fleet had Weigh’d Anchor, and were
gone to <i>Panama</i>; only the Admiral which carry’d forty Brass Guns, with fifty
Merchant-Men, lay close under the Shore, Guarded by three Stone Bulwarks,
Fortifi’d with fifty Guns.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>L’Hermite</i> having a design upon these, took three <i>Spanish</i> Vessels that were
going thither, and at midnight, sent Captain <i>Adrian Tol</i>, <i>Peter Slobbe</i>, and <i>Meindert
Egbertszon</i>, with twelve well Mann’d Boats, furnish’d with Brass Drakes,
and Hand-Granado’s, to Attaque the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet that lay hard by; and whilst
some gave a false Alarm on the North of <i>Callao</i>, the Boats Rowing from Ship
to Ship, in short time fir’d forty of them; although the <i>Spaniards</i> from the
Shore endeavor’d by their Shot to drive back the Enemy, neither the Fort or
Admiral sparing Powder nor Ball.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this valiant Exploit the <i>Hollanders</i> had onely seven Men kill’d, and fifteen
Wounded: About break of day, seven of the <i>Spanish</i> Ships floated, burning towards
the <i>Dutch</i> Fleet, which were as terrible as now Fire-ships, which forc’d
them to Weigh Anchor to shun them.</p>

<p class='c010'>After that, <i>L’Hermite</i> took two Ships laden with Wine, a third full of Wood,
and a fourth with Wheat: One of these Prizes he fitted and prepar’d for a
Fire-ship, and sending her to Board the <i>Spanish</i> Admiral, it ran aground within
shot of him; whereupon being batter’d by the Admirals Guns, and those
from the Bulwarks, and at last taking Fire gave but a small blow, because
most part of the Powder had taken Wet.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this interim, while thus their design went prosperously on, their Admiral
<i>L’Heremite</i> dy’d, whom they Bury’d on the Island <i>Lima</i>, and <i>Schapenham</i>, in defiance
of the Vice-Roy in <i>Callao</i>, caus’d one and twenty <i>Spaniards</i> to be hang’d
at the Yard-Arm, because he had sent him a scornful Answer on the Proposals
concerning the delivery of the Prisoners.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Schapenham</i> dies.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Cornelius Jacobszoon</i> Sailing to <i>Pisco</i> with four Sail from the Fleet, could do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>no good there, for he not onely found the City to be surrounded with a Wall
of fifteen Foot high, but having also many Earthen Redoubts, behind which
lay above two thousand arm’d Men, wherefore he deserted the same after some
Rancounters: But the Rear-Admiral, <i>John Williamszoon Vershoor</i>, who was sent
to <i>Gainquil</i>, had much better luck; for he not onely took that Metropolis, but
also burnt a new Royal <i>Gallion</i>, and two lesser Vessels; carry’d a conquer’d
Vessel to <i>Lima</i>; slew above a hundred <i>Spaniards</i>, and threw seventeen overboard,
because they had shot Poyson’d Bullets against the Law of Arms; of
which Conquest Captain <i>Engelbert Shutte</i> had the greatest honor: But the Sea-men
grew weaker and weaker by the Scurvy, and all of them would have perish’d,
had they not found a soveraign Herb on the highest Mountains of <i>Lima</i>.
<i>Schapenham</i> being chose Admiral in <i>L’Heremites</i> place, Weigh’d Anchor from <i>Callao</i>,
and ran into the Inlet <i>Piscadores</i>, where on the shore he rais’d a Sconce; yet
not long after departed from thence without any effect, but lost twenty eight
Men, through the bad Conduct of their Commanders; the like number he
lost also at <i>Aquapulque</i>, on the side of which City stands a Castle with four
strong Bulwarks; the <i>Holland</i> Fire-ship lay just without the reach of the shot,
the rest lay along the shore in a row, there to seize upon the Vessels expected
thither from the <i>Manillaes</i>: But because the Scurvy raged amongst the Sea-men,
and disabled them, they waited in vain, <i>Schapenham</i> Sail’d through the South-Sea
to the <i>Ladrones</i>, where he found store of Provisions. <i>Anno 1625.</i> in <i>March</i>,
he drop’d Anchor before <i>Maleye</i>, and from thence went with <i>Herman Spiult</i>, the
Governor for the <i>East-India</i> Company in <i>Amboina</i>, to <i>Ceram</i>, where they Conquer’d
the Fort <i>Lochoe</i>, and soon after <i>Cambella</i>; then the Fleet being divided,
<i>Schapenham</i> carry’d home two Ships from <i>Batavia</i>, and the remainder return’d
at several times, they being hir’d to serve the <i>East-India</i> Company to <i>Surratta</i>,
<i>Malacca</i>, <i>Coromandel</i>, and the <i>Molucco Isles</i>: <i>Schapenham</i> Deceasing near <i>Bantum</i>,
and being Bury’d on <i>Pulo Boftok</i>, the Ships arriv’d at the <i>Texel</i> in <i>July, Anno
1626.</i></p>

<h4 id='c122' class='c013'>Henry Brewer <i>his Voyage</i>.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'><i>Anno 1643.</i> <i>Brewer</i> set Sail with four Ships from <i>Reciffo</i>, and ran close along
the <i>States-Isle</i>, so dangerous and Rocky, that he durst not put in to the
Land; from which flew great abundance of Party-colour’d Ducks, with sharp
Bills, about the Ships, and under the Keels swam also Whales.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sea Lions.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable Exploits.</div>

<p class='c010'>On the West side of the <i>Straights Le Maire</i>, <i>Brown</i> ran into <i>Valentine</i>’s Inlet,
where he was much troubled by the Winds which came whistling through the
hollow Mountains with great and sudden gusts: The shore afforded red and
black Strawberries, <i>Carville</i> and Muscles, to the great refreshment of the Sea-men,
who daily saw Sea-Lions, but could not come to shoot one of them, for
no sooner they perceiv’d any body, but they Diving under Water, swam away;
and though they saw Mens Foot-steps of eighteen Inches long, yet they never
found any Men. Thence Sailing into the South-Sea, along the Coast of <i>Chili</i>,
they enter’d a Bay which they nam’d <i>Brewer’s-Haven</i>; where Landing, they
walk’d towards a great Smoke which they saw afar off, but coming near it,
found only two Houses within a large Plain, full of Sheep, Oxen, and Horses;
before the Houses stood Woodden Crosses.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Baldivia</i>, a brave City.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Dolphin</i> Pink and a great Boat being sent to the Inlet, lay the following
Night at an Anchor near a high Mountain; from whence, in the Night, two
great Guns were fir’d, whereupon, Lieutenant <i>William Ter Bergen</i> Landed with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>sixteen Musqueteers, and climbing up the Mountain, found a Village behind
the same, where all things were in Alarm, Drums beating, Trumpets sounding,
Bells ringing; the Villagers suddenly firing their Guns on <i>Ter Bergen</i>, who
being supply’d with thirty four Men, Encounter’d the Enemy so Valiantly,
that he fled into the Woods, not without the loss of Men and Horses: The
Guns with which they had shot in the Night lay onely on a Redoubt: <i>Ter Bergen</i>
persuing this Victory, March’d into the Woods, and shot the <i>Spanish</i> Commander
<i>Andreas Munes Iserrera</i> from his Horse, got great store of Treasure which
lay hid under the Tree, being brought out of <i>Carelmappa</i>, which Village he set
afire, and kill’d all the Horses, and Weigh’d Anchor with the Admiral <i>Brewer</i>
to <i>Michael de Cabuco</i> where not being able to Land, because of the many obscure
Rocks and Shoals, they set Sail to <i>Castro</i>, which they conquer’d and burnt
without the least resistance: This City situate on a Mountain is stately built
among Flowry Meadows, delightful Orchards, and brave Fountains; the Sea
before it flows daily fourteen Foot. <i>Brewer</i> also burnt a <i>Spanish</i> Ship, and set
some Houses afire, took three <i>Spaniards</i> Prisoners on <i>Las Bahias</i>, who inform’d
him, that the Winter Season was almost over, but that it was never known
by any to pass over so mildly, ill Weather generally using to blow down
Houses, Trees, and rend Rocks asunder; that there was much Gold in <i>Osorno</i>
and <i>Baldivia</i>, which last they had some years since deserted for hunger, but it
was since Garrison’d by three hundred <i>Castilians</i>, that none could get at the Fort
<i>Conception</i> (which lay a League Westerly from thence) but in a small Boat, that
there were on the place near two thousand Inhabitants. Moreover, an ancient
Matron call’d <i>Lovysa Pizarra</i>, from <i>Quintian</i>, one of the Isles in the <i>Chilean</i> In-Land-Sea,
being fetch’d from thence, gave information, that forty years since,
before the <i>Indians</i> took up Arms, the <i>Spaniards</i> were quietly setled in <i>Osorno</i>, and
in so good a condition, that an ordinary Planter had at least three hundred
Slaves, of which, every one was to procure a certain quantity of Gold; that the
Isles <i>Chiloves</i> were divided into above a hundred Colonies or Plantations, the
<i>Chileses</i> serving the <i>Castilians</i> as their true Governors; those that do good Service
the King of the Colony makes them Commanders, and that the <i>Chileses</i><a id='t123'></a> had
Rebell’d in several places. <i>Brewer</i> on the <i>Chileses</i> request took some of them,
with their Wives and Children into his Ship, furnish’d with Arms, he digg’d
a Chest of Silver and a Brass Gun out of the Earth, and soon after being sick,
dy’d. His Successor <i>Elias Herkmans</i> prosecuting those Publick Affairs, sent
the Pilot of the <i>Unity</i> out of <i>Brewer’s Haven</i>, and some Sea-men, with two <i>Chilean
Casiques</i> with a Boat to <i>Carelmappa</i>; but being surpriz’d by a violent Storm,
stood in for <i>Horse-Island</i>, where he and the <i>Casiques</i> Landing, he order’d seven
Sea-men to carry the Boat to a safer Harbor; but being driven from the shore
by strong Winds it took in so much Water as fill’d and sunk it, so that all of
them were drown’d. <i>Horse-Island</i> being destitute of Provisions and Lodgings,
those that were Landed expected nothing but Death, till they found out a small
Hut, and in the same six brave Sheep, and a good quantity of Potatoe Roots,
which serv’d for Bread: But when this their new-found Store was almost spent,
they happily were fetch’d off by the Boat belonging to the Ship <i>Amsterdam</i>, and
with the whole Fleet came to an Anchor before <i>Baldivia</i>. This City built by
the <i>Castilians</i>, consisted formerly of five hundred and fifty fair Houses, and was
divided into Streets and cross Ways, with two large Markets, and as many
costly Churches.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Why the <i>Chileses</i> grew strange to the <i>Hollanders</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Chileses</i> unsufferably oppress’d, slew all the <i>Spanish</i> Garrison, and into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>the Governor’s Mouth and Ears pour’d melted Gold; of his Skull they made a
Drinking-cup, and of his Shin-bones, Trumpets; after this, the City fell almost
to decay, onely a great part of the Wall remain’d yet standing: The <i>Chileans</i>
hereupon flock’d hither by thousands, some on Horses, others on Foot, all
Arm’d with Lances of a Foot long: <i>Herkman</i> hereupon informing them by an
Interpreter, that they being mortal Enemies of the <i>Spaniards</i>, would joyn with
the <i>Chileans</i> against that common Foe; and desir’d, that they might build a Fort
on the Market-place in <i>Baldivia</i>, for a defence against all Invasions, and that
they might be supply’d with Provisions which the Fleet wanted; all which the
<i>Chileans</i> granted, and accordingly brought in store of Sheep, Hogs, and Cattel:
But so soon as <i>Herkman</i> began to make the least mention of Gold, they were
all abash’d, and said, that they knew of no Gold Mines, nay, their Hair stood
an end, when they heard the name of Gold; so horribly the <i>Spaniards</i> had dealt
with their Parents: After this, the <i>Chileans</i> growing more and more strange,
did not in the least countenance the building of the Fort, and the longer the
Fleet staid, the less Provisions they brought aboard; upon which, the Ships
were necessitated, without any remarkable Exploits, to set Sail and return to
<i>Reciffo</i>.</p>

Having in the first part of this Volume discours’d at large
concerning the original of the <i>Americans</i>, and whether that
part of the World call’d <i>India Occidentalis</i>, or <i>America</i>, were
known to the Ancients, or own its Discovery wholly to
the Moderns, as also of all the Discoveries that have been
made of the several parts thereof, and by whom, we shall
now pass on to the Topographical part, describing every
particular Province or Region, by giving an account of
their Situation, Temperature, Productions, Nature of the Soil, and Quality of the
Inhabitants. <i>America</i>, lying Westward of the <i>Azores</i>, and the Worlds Meridian, is
by some suppos’d to consist of one vast Island, and several lesser ones, scatter’d about
it: Nor can this supposition be thought vain, if, as many think, it be inviron’d
on the North-side, as toward the East, South, and West it is known to be; East
and South, by the <i>Atlantick Ocean</i>; and West, by <i>Mar del Zur</i>: But because the
North-West Passage, though attempted by many, as <i>Nelson</i>, <i>Davis</i>, <i>Forbisher</i>, <i>Button</i>,
<i>Smith</i>, <i>Hudson</i>, and others, hath not yet by any been fully discover’d; so that it is
not certainly known whether <i>America</i> be joyn’d to <i>Greenland</i>, and the <i>Arctick</i> Region,
by a continu’d Tract of Land, or sever’d by the Ocean: We shall follow the method
of those Geographers, who, reputed sufficiently Authentick, have divided this
new World into Islands, and two grand <i>Peninsula</i>’s joyn’d together by an <i>Isthmus</i>, or
Neck of Land, call’d <i>The Straight of Darien</i>, by some <i>The Straight of Panama</i>, lying almost
under the Equinoctial Line, and extending in length from <i>Nombre de Dios</i>
Southward above a hundred Miles, and from East to West seventeen Miles over in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>the narrowest place. Of these two grand <i>Peninsula</i>’s the Northern is generally call’d
<i>America Mexicana</i>, from <i>Mexico</i> the chief City of the Province, properly call’d <i>Mexicana</i>;
which was heretofore without doubt the most potent, rich, and flourishing
of all the Kingdoms of the <i>Indians</i>, at least on the North-side of the <i>Isthmus</i>. In the
division of the several Provinces of <i>America</i>, as well those of the Northern as of the
Southern Continent, we find so various an account among the several Geographers
that have written of them (not any two of them agreeing in one and the same order)
that to reconcile the differing methods of so many disagreeing Authors
would be an endless work: wherefore we shall pitch upon the surest course, and
not omitting the mention of any of the Provinces taken notice of by the said Authors,
hereby endeavor to take in whatsoever material hath been observ’d by all
of them, and by the way take occasion to shew how one differs from another in the
distribution of them. Those therefore of the Northern <i>America</i> (that as near as
can be we may bring the design of many into one) seem most fitly describ’d in this
following order:  1. <i>Estotiland</i>;  2. <i>Terra Laboratoris</i>, or <i>Nova Britannia</i>;  3. <i>Canada</i>,
or <i>Nova Francia</i>; 4. <i>Nova Scotia</i>; 5. <i>New England</i>; 6. <i>New Netherlands</i>, now call’d
<i>New York</i>, as being in the possession of the <i>English</i>; 7. <i>New Holland</i>; 8. <i>New Swedeland</i>;
9. <i>Apalchen</i>, now call’d <i>Virginia</i>; 10. <i>Florida</i>; 11. <i>Jucatan</i>; 12. <i>Honduras</i>;
13. <i>Nicaragua</i>; 14. <i>Veragua</i>; 15. <i>Costarica</i>; 16. <i>Anien</i>; 17. <i>Nova Hispania</i>; 18. <i>Guacatimala</i>;
19. <i>Nova Gallicia</i>; 20. <i>Nova Biscaia</i>; 21. <i>Nova  Mexico</i>; 22. <i>Cibola</i>;
23. <i>Nova Granata</i>; 24. <i>Tontonteac</i>; 25. <i>Quivira</i>; 26. <i>Nova Albion</i>; to which by most
Authors is added <i>California</i>; which being an Island we thought fit to reserve to be
spoken of amongst the Islands, as also <i>Terra Nova</i>, or <i>New-found Land</i>; which last
lies utmost West, as the other East of Northern <i>America</i>. Some there are also (and
particularly <i>Monsieur de Martini</i>) who among the above-mention’d Provinces have
inserted <i>Greenland</i>, though doubtless with little reason, since though it be granted
that it is not divided by any Sea, yet it is evident, if any credit may be given to all
modern Maps and Globes, that the greatest part of <i>Greenland</i> lies in the Hemisphere
of the known World; and therefore we have judg’d it most convenient to refer the
particular mention thereof to the Description of the <i>Arctick</i> Region.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Islands of <i>Northern America</i> are 1. <i>Terra Nova</i>, or <i>New-found Land</i>; 2. The
<i>Island of  Assumption</i>; 3. The <i>Bermudas</i>, or <i>Summer-Island</i>; 4. <i>Hispaniola</i>; 5. <i>St. John
Porto Rico</i>; 6. <i>Cuba</i>; 7. <i>Jamaica</i>; 8. The <i>Lucayes</i>; 9. The <i>Caribes</i>, or <i>Antillæ</i>;
10. <i>Margarita</i>; 11. <i>Cubagua</i>; 12. <i>La Trinidad</i>; 13. <i>Tabago</i>; 14. <i>California</i>, the biggest
of all the <i>American</i> Islands.</p>

<p class='c010'>The length of the <i>West-Indies</i> is generally computed to be from the utmost South
of <i>Terra Magellanica</i>, to the farthest North of <i>Estotiland</i>, about six thousand <i>English</i>
Miles, reaching from six Degrees of Northern, to fifty three of Southern Latitude;
the breadth from <i>St. Michael</i> or <i>Piura</i> Westward, to <i>Parabaya</i>, a Town on the Coast
of <i>Brasil</i> Eastward, three thousand nine hundred Miles, and the whole compass
thirty thousand.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>That the <i>English</i> have been very great Undertakers of Voyages and Discoveries
toward the North-West, appears by the denomination of divers places,
both from the Persons which have Sail’d thitherward, and also from
such of our own Countrey Names as were thought fit to be there fix’d, as beyond
the <i>Arctick Circle</i> are Sir <i>James Lancaster’s Sound</i>, Sir <i>Dudley Diggs’s Cape</i>, Queens <i>Annes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Foreland, Cumberland Isles, Davis’s Straight, &amp;c.</i> on this side toward the <i>Arctick Circle</i>,
<i>Button</i>’s and <i>Brigg</i>’s <i>Bay</i>, <i>Hudson</i>’s <i>Sea</i>, otherwise term’d <i>Mare Christianum</i>, out of
which more Westerly runs a narrow Sea call’d <i>Hudson</i>’s <i>Straight</i>: beyond <i>Hudson</i>’s
<i>Sea</i> towards the <i>Arctick Circle</i> is a place call’d <i>New North-Wales</i>; and on this side answerable
to it, between <i>Button</i>’s <i>Bay</i> and the <i>Christian Sea</i>, lies <i>New South-Wales</i>; all
which places we find generally set down in the <i>American</i> Hemisphere, but in the
Geographical Discourses thereof little is said of them, if so much as nam’d. The
farthest part of Land Northward, between <i>Hudson</i>’s <i>Gulph</i> and <i>Hudson</i>’s <i>Straight</i>,
betwixt fifty seven and sixty Degrees of Northern Latitude, goes generally by the
Name of <i>Estotiland</i>, I mean that properly so call’d (for <i>Estotiland</i> is by some as
largely taken as <i>Canada</i>, by <i>Cluverius</i>, <i>Golnitzius</i>, <i>Peter du Val</i>, and others, namely for
all that Tract of Land extending from that supposed <i>Straight of Anian</i>, which divides
<i>America</i> from <i>Asiatick Tartary</i>, as far as the utmost point of Land that shoots
toward the <i>Atlantick Ocean</i>) which Southerly towards <i>Terra Laboratoris</i> is bounded
with a River vulgarly call’d <i>Rio Nevado</i>, or <i>The Snowy River</i>. <i>Estotiland</i> seems to
have deriv’d its Name from its lying more Easterly than the rest of the Provinces,
and, according as <i>Nova Britannia</i> is plac’d in some Charts, might very well be taken
for the same, though it hath not been so term’d by any Author, but rather <i>Terra
Laboratoris</i>, <i>Cortereatis</i>, and <i>Nova Britannia</i> are generally receiv’d to be all one.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First discovery of <i>Estotiland</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Nature of the People.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Province is affirm’d by <i>Matthias Quadus</i>, and <i>J. Antonius Maginus</i>, to have
been the first discover’d Countrey of the new World, and that by <i>Antonius Zeno</i>, a
Patrician of <i>Venice</i>, in the Year of our Lord 1390. which was long before the Expedition
of <i>Columbus</i>, through the encouragement of <i>Zichmus</i>, King of the Isle of
<i>Friezland</i>; but by whomsoever found out, or at whatsoever time, it is commonly
affirm’d to be not ill furnish’d with Provisions of all sorts, as Beasts, Birds, Fish,
Fowl, and Fruits, having a Soil indifferent fertile, in respect of the coldness of the
Climate. The People in general (for some there are that live wild and salvage up
and down the Woods, and go naked, whereas the Clothing of the Countrey is the
Skins of Beasts and of Sea-Calves, call’d <i>Morses</i>) are reported not onely tolerably
civil, but also ingenious and expert both in mechanick Arts, and other necessary
Faculties, insomuch that the first Voyagers to this place are said to have observ’d of
them upon this first Discovery, That they sow’d Corn, brew’d Beer and Ale, and
Traded by Sea to <i>Greenland</i>, <i>Friezland</i>, and other places, to the distance of fifteen
hundred Miles; and that they were not altogether void of the use of Letters, but
that their Character was onely proper to themselves and not intelligible by any
other Nation: Moreover, there is a certain Tradition, that there was here and there
some little knowledge of the <i>Latine</i> Tongue amongst them, and that there were
found divers <i>Latine</i> Books in a Library of one of their Kings; the reason of which,
if true, is conjectur’d to be from certain <i>Europeans</i> who understood that Language,
having in Ages past suffer’d shipwrack upon those Coasts, where chancing to abide
either through constraint or choice, they might haply at their Decease leave behind
them some Books and other Monuments of the <i>Latine</i> Tongue. They were observ’d
to use such a kind of Javelin or short Dart, as was known to be us’d by the
People of <i>Java</i>, and some other Islands of the <i>East-Indies</i>; whereupon it seems not
wholly improbable, that they might for a long time have entertain’d Traffick and
Correspondence with them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the <i>Morses</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Morses</i>, or Sea-Calves before mention’d, are about the bigness of a young
Heifer, the Hunting of which by the Natives, who take them in great numbers, is
to them in the stead of Whale-fishing, which is not there so good, for they draw a
great quantity of Train-Oyl out of them. On each side of the Jaw of this amphibious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Creature (for it is said to live very much on the Land, as well as in the Water)
there sticks out a crooked Tusk, winding downward like an Elephants <i>Proboscis</i>,
above a Cubit in length, and as white and hard as Ivory: It is esteem’d of great
vertue, at least it passes for such among those who take it for other than what it is,
for it is frequently vended for Unicorns-horn; of which imposture Dr. <i>Brown</i> takes
notice, and gives a Caution against in his <i>Vulgar Errors</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey is suppos’d, and that probably enough, to have store of Brass and
Iron Mines; but for the Mines of Gold and Silver, which some have imagin’d there,
the Northerly Situation of the Countrey, and by consequence the coldness of the
Climate, give sufficient cause to question the truth of any such assertion. What
chief Towns, Cities, Rivers and Mountains there are in this Province, is not yet
deliver’d by any, onely <i>Maginus</i> and <i>Quadus</i> make mention of four principal Rivers,
which disperse themselves through the Countrey, and take their source out of a
great Mountain in the midst thereof.</p>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Terra Laboratoris</i>, by some call’d <i>Nova Britannia</i>, by others <i>Corterealis</i>, (though
there are some who make <i>Laboratoris</i> and <i>Corterealis</i> two distinct Countreys,
comprehended, according to <i>Peter du Val</i>, under <i>Nova Britannia</i>, as the more
general Province; or, according to <i>Cluverius</i>, under <i>Canada</i>) lies from about fifty
four to fifty seven Degrees of Northern Latitude, between <i>Estotiland</i> and the River
<i>Canada</i>, which <i>Maginus</i> and some others, though for what reason is not express’d,
name <i>Fretum trium Fratrum</i>, <i>The Bay of the three Brethren</i>; others, <i>The River of
St. Laurence</i>, and is, according to the said Author, of so vast a bigness, that the
Mouth of it extends it self thirty five <i>Italian</i> Miles wide; likewise of such a length,
as to have been navigated a continu’d Voyage of eight hundred Miles. The denomination
of <i>Terra de Laborador</i>, or <i>Laboratoris</i>, seems probably enough conjectur’d
to be from the cultivability (if one may so term it) of the Soil, or its aptness for
Cultivation or Tillage; that is, because by the painful Hand of the Labourer or
Husband-man it may be rendred so fertile, as to yield all sorts of Grain and Fruits;
haply in allusion to that fruitful Countrey of <i>Campania</i> in <i>Italy</i>, vulgarly known by
the Name of <i>Terra di Lavoro</i>. As for the Appellation of <i>Terra Corterealis</i>, it need not
be question’d, but that it derives it self from <i>Gaspar Corterealis</i>, a <i>Portuguese</i> Gentleman,
who about the Year of our Lord 1500. is thought by some to have made the
first discovery of these Parts; though Sir <i>Sebastian Cabot</i> a <i>Venetian</i>, is more generally
believ’d to have been the Man that (under the favour and countenance of <i>Henry</i>
the Seventh, King of <i>England</i>) first discover’d them, at least the adjoyning Island
<i>Terra Nova</i>, or <i>New-found Land</i>; but just onely discover’d, being hinder’d the farther
prosecution of that Design, by the important Affairs in which the said King
was about that time involv’d; neither did <i>Corterealis</i>, whether he was the first, or
came after, do any more, for returning within a year after his first setting out, he
was never heard of; nor, as <i>Osorius</i> a <i>Portuguese</i> Historian writes, any of his Company,
being all suppos’d to have been drown’d by Shipwrack; and in like manner
<i>Michael Corterealis</i>, who the year following set forth with two Ships in quest of
his Brother <i>Gaspar</i>. Upon which series of Misfortunes the <i>Portuguese</i> being wholly
discourag’d, and giving over this Design, the <i>French</i> of <i>Armorica</i> or <i>Bretany</i> succeed
them in it with somewhat better success about the Year 1504. whereupon it came to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>be term’d <i>Nova Britannia</i>, or <i>New Britain</i>. The ancient Inhabitants of this place
were formerly of a Nature, like the generality of the <i>American</i> People, somewhat
bruitish and salvage, but by long conversation with the <i>French</i>, are said to have
cast off their original wildness, and become more civilly manner’d: they are very
jealous of their Wives, by report much addicted to Soothsaying, though otherwise
having little of Religion, or of any other kind of Learning; they dwell for the most
part in Caves under Ground, feed chiefly upon Fish, and are accounted most expert
Archers. Whatever places the <i>French</i> have built here besides, those of chiefest
note are <i>St. Maries</i>, <i>Cabo Marzo</i>, and <i>Brest</i>.</p>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Canada</i>, as it is taken for one and the same Province with <i>New France</i>, contains
<i>New France</i>, properly so call’d, <i>Nova Scotia</i>, <i>Norumbega</i>, and some adjoyning
Islands, as the <i>Canada</i> of <i>Cluverius</i>, lying more North-Westerly,
comprehends (as we have already intimated) <i>Estotiland</i>, <i>Laboratoris</i>, and <i>Corterealis</i>,
and, according to the most modern Division (for that of <i>Cluverius</i> neither consents
with the latest Authors, nor agrees with exact Survey, it being nam’d <i>Canada</i>,
in respect the River <i>Canada</i> runs through it) hath on the North <i>Terra Corterealis</i>, on
the South <i>New England</i>, and on the East the Ocean, and hath between forty five
and fifty two or fifty three Degrees of Northern Latitude. The River <i>Canada</i> is
judg’d to be the largest of all the Rivers of <i>America</i>, as those Rivers generally the
largest of all in the World besides; it rises in the Western parts of this Province
which remain yet undiscover’d, and in some places spreads it self into huge Lakes,
some of them a hundred Miles in compass, with many little Islands dispersed
up and down in them, and so running from the West about a hundred Leagues, falls
at last into the North part of <i>St. Lawrence Bay</i>, being that wide <i>Emboucheure</i> of thirty
five Miles breadth already mention’d. This River is extraordinary full of Fish,
among which there is one sort more remarkable than the rest, call’d by the Inhabitants
<i>Cadhothuis</i>, having Heads resembling the Heads of Hares, and Bodies as
white as Snow; they are taken for the most part before the Isle <i>de Lievres</i>. The
Countrey on both sides of the River is pleasant and indifferently fertile, especially
towards the South-West, where upwards from the River the Ground rises into
many little Hills, invested most of them with Vines, with which and several other
sorts of Trees this Countrey abounds, being well water’d with a great many lesser
Streams, all of them falling into the River <i>Canada</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First discovery.</div>

<p class='c010'>That this Countrey is term’d <i>New France</i>, from having been discover’d by the
<i>French</i>, at least more fully than before, there needs no question to be made; but
whether <i>Joannes Verrazanus</i>, under <i>Francis</i> the First of <i>France</i>, or <i>Sebastian Cabot</i> before
spoken of, were the first in this Discovery, may admit of something of dispute:
the <i>Cabots</i> indeed, (for <i>John</i> the Father is by some mention’d to have accompanied
his Son) who by all are own’d the first Discoverers of <i>New-found-Land</i> and <i>Terra de
Baccalaos</i>, are also commonly reputed to have first found out the Province of <i>New
France</i>, together with some parts adjacent, though perhaps it might be upon this
Ground that <i>Terra de Nova</i>, or <i>New-found-Land</i>, not being known at first to be an
Island, <i>New France</i> and that might be taken for one continu’d Province; and it appears
so much the more probable, because <i>Canada</i>, or <i>Nova Francia</i>, is by some call’d
<i>Terra Nova</i>; however it be, or whoever were the first Adventurers, <i>Quarteri</i> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span><i>Champlain</i> are the two <i>French</i>-men that have gain’d so much fame by making a more
ample and particular search into these parts, that this Province may seem from
thence to have sufficient claim to the Title of <i>New France</i>, whereof that part more
especially so call’d, lies on the North-side of the River <i>Canada</i>, and Southward to
<i>Terra Corterealis</i>. The Winter is here very long, and so much the more severe by
reason of a cold North-West Wind which blows most part of the Winter Season,
and brings with it so thick a Snow, that it continues upon the Ground most commonly
till after <i>May</i>. The Countrey is for the most part wooddy, but in the
Champain parts thereof very fruitful of Corn, and all sorts of Grain, especially
Pulse: It hath also Fish, Fowl, wild Deer, Bears, Marterns, and Foxes in abundance,
and of Hares such plenty, that one of the little Islands belonging to this Province,
is by the <i>French</i> nam’d <i>L’Isle des Lievres</i>, or <i>The Island of Hares</i>: But the most
peculiar Commodity belonging to this Countrey is the <i>Esurgnuy</i>, a kind of Shell-Fish,
extraordinary white, and approv’d of singular vertue for the stanching of
Blood; to which purpose they make Bracelets of them, not onely for their own
use, but also to vend them to others; but <i>John de Laet</i> and others have observ’d no
other than a superstitious use of them amongst the Salvages, in their Funeral Rites
for the Dead: the manner of their taking it is very remarkable; for when any one
is condemn’d to die, or taken Prisoner, they cut off all his fleshy parts in long slices,
and then throw him into the River, where they let him lie twelve hours, and at
last pulling him out again find his Wounds full of <i>Esurgnui</i>. <i>Quadus</i> and <i>Maginus</i>
make mention of three ancient Towns, namely <i>Canada</i> (denominated as the Province,
from the River) <i>Hochelai</i> and <i>Hochchelaga</i>, giving Name to a Territory about
it, which Geographers either take no notice of, or make some question of the being
of such Towns; however, a late Describer of the <i>West-Indies</i>, not mentioning
the other two, gives this description of the last, <i>viz.</i> <i>Hochchelaga</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'>“This City (saith he) said to be the Seat and Residence of a King of this Country
whom the Natives, at least some of them, acknowledge and reverence, carrying
him sometimes in great pomp upon their Shoulders sitting upon a Carpet of
Beasts Skins, is situate far within Land, at a distance of six or seven Leagues from
the River <i>Canada</i>, and is a kind of fortifi’d place, encompass’d about with a threefold
Range of Timber Ramparts one within another, of about two Rods high
from the Ground, with cross Planks, or pieces of Timber jutting out, on purpose
to hinder an Enemy’s Scaling or getting up; towards the top there is as it were a
Scaffold or Gallery fram’d, from whence they may throw down Stones of which
there is always good store ready, or what else to annoy the Assailants: It hath
one onely Gate for Entrance, and that likewise well fortifi’d after their manner:
There are guess’d to be in it fifty or sixty great Houses, built (as the maner of the
<i>Americans</i> that live in Houses usually is) in a square Figure, each side being about
fifty Foot long, or more, and sixteen or twenty broad, but not many Stories
high; and in the midst of the Court or void space, a place to make their Fire,
and do other necessary work about it. Moreover the Territory round about
this Town is both rich in Soil, and pleasant in Prospect.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides these three above-mention’d Towns there are several others, which are
not untaken notice of in the most modern Descriptions and Maps, <i>viz.</i> 1. <i>Stadac</i>,
or <i>Stadacone</i>, somewhat Westward of a small Isle call’d <i>The Isle d’Orleance</i>; 2. <i>Quebeque</i>,
which being made a Colony of the <i>French</i>, and the Natives expell’d, came to
be Entituled <i>St. Croix</i>; 3. <i>Tadoussac</i>, which lies in that part of the Countrey denominated
from the River <i>Saguenay</i>, and by some call’d at this day <i>Nouvelle Biscaye</i>, a delightful
place, and full of stately Trees, and hath likewise a good and safe Haven,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>capable of receiving twenty Ships; 4. <i>Trois Rivieris</i>, or three Rivers; 5. <i>Monreal</i>;
6. <i>Sillery</i>; 7. <i>Richelieu</i>; besides two strong Castles or Forts, <i>Franceroy</i> and
St. <i>Lewis</i>; the First built by <i>Monsieur Robeval</i> at his Landing here, about the
Year 1540. the other design’d for a Colony, in the Year 1611. by <i>Monsieur
Champlany</i>, but hinder’d by the Invasion of the <i>Iroquois</i>. The smaller Rivers that
run out of the Gulph of St. <i>Lawrence</i>, and the grand River <i>Canada</i> towards the
North, on which side chiefly lies this Province, are, 1. <i>Chichesedec</i>, 2. St. <i>Margarite</i>,
3. <i>Lesquemin</i>, 4. <i>Saquenay</i>, before-mention’d, 5. <i>Montonne</i>; and on the South side, the
River <i>Mary</i>. The principal Tribes of the ancient Natives of this Countrey were;
on the North side of <i>Canada</i> the <i>Canadans</i>, the <i>Betisiamites</i>, the <i>Hurons</i>, the <i>Algoniquins</i>,
the <i>Quenongebins</i>, the <i>Algoingequins</i>, the <i>Attagopantans</i>, the <i>Atticameques</i>, the <i>Nipisiriniens</i>;
and on the South side, the <i>Etechemins</i>, and the chief Heads or Princes of these Tribes
were call’d <i>Sagamores</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Fish nam’d <i>Chaousarou</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Jaques Quartier</i> Complementing their King <i>Agouthanna</i>, took up his Quarters a
whole Winter at St. <i>Croix</i>, a Sandy Promontory, overflow’d by the River <i>Canada</i>,
into which falls the Lake <i>de Champlain</i>, grown round about with Chestnut Trees;
in it breeds the strange Fish call’d <i>Chaousarou</i>, generally ten Foot long, with Heads
like Sharks, and two rows of Teeth in their Mouths, their Skins full of strong
Scales, which are sufficient Shields against Swords and Lances, are great devourers
of other Fish and Fowls, which they take after this manner, <i>viz.</i> they swim amongst
Reeds or Canes, and lie still with their Mouths open; whereat the Birds
sitting down upon them, are immediately swallow’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Natives of <i>Nova Francia</i> anoint their bodies with Oil; in the Summer they
go naked, and in the Winter mantle themselves in Furs. Their Warlike Accoutrements
are Darts and Clubs, but chiefly great Shields. They are revengeful, cruel,
and fraudulent; their Women common to all Men, from fifteen to twenty, after
which, Marrying, they become very Chaste. Their Diet is <i>Indian</i> Corn, fresh and
salt Fish, Venison, <i>Buffalo</i>’s and Beavers flesh; wiping their Fingers (when greasie)
on their Heads, or their Dogs backs, which wait for the Scraps.</p>

<p class='c010'>At that season when the Corn covers the ground, to any heighth, they eat Cockles,
Dogs, dead Caryon, and the Skins wherewith they Clothe themselves. When they
have eaten their fill, they tabering on their Bellies, cry, <i>Tapoue Mikispoun</i>, that is, <i>Verily
I am satisfi’d</i>. They give their Sick a speedy Cure, either immediately killing
them, or inhumanely exposing them to the Woods, to be devour’d by ravenous
Beasts, but if they die suddenly, they in howling tone pronounce <i>Ove, Ove</i>, thereby
to chase the Souls of the Deceas’d out of their Huts; they stick the bodies on Woodden
Prongs, cover them with Bark, and lay their Clothes and Arms by them;
all what remains of the Funeral Feasts is burnt, whereas at other times, what e’re
is brought on their Table they eat, though ready to burst. They make the first
Proofs of their Valour by undergoing a most prodigious Torment, in this manner;
Two by consent tie their naked Arms together, on which they suffer burning
Sulphur to be pour’d, till the flesh starts from the bone; if either of them shrink,
or pull back his Arm, he is accounted by them ever after as an ignominious and
base Coward. They call God <i>Atahocan</i>, and believe that one <i>Messou</i> first drowning
the world by a general Deluge, restor’d it again after a wonderful manner, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Messou</i> hunting with Wolves, they scented a Deer which being closely pursu’d,
leap’d into a neighboring Pool, the Wolves following it, were drown’d; <i>Messou</i>
coming thither, stood amaz’d at a Bird, which inform’d him, that the Wolves
were pluck’d down, and held fast in the bottom by horrible Monsters, whereupon
he diving, the Pool immediately began to swell, and at last the whole surface
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>of the Earth to be overflow’d. <i>Messou</i> afterwards let a Raven flie to fetch a
Clod of Earth, but in vain, for all the Land lay drown’d in Water; at last a Rat
diving to the bottom, brought a lump of Earth, out of which <i>Messou</i> restor’d the
World; shot Arrows into Trees, which became fruitful Branches. Here also reside
an innumerable many <i>Sorcerers</i>, call’d <i>Pillotoa</i>’s, which sometimes being possess’d
with a Frenzy, scourge themselves in a terrible manner, insomuch that the
Blood runs down by their sides: These People are held in great esteem, for they
boast themselves to have their Original from Heaven upon this occasion, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Ataensic</i>, a certain great Queen or Goddess, residing above the Stars, had a sick Husband,
who Dreamt that he should be restor’d to his former health so soon as he
could but taste of the Fruits which grew on a Tree, whereby the Family of Heaven
were kept alive, but that the Tree must needs be cut down, which <i>Ataensic</i>
obeying, gave onely two blows, when the Tree, to her great amazement, fell out
of Heaven down to the Earth; there being by this means nothing more left to eat
in Heaven: <i>Ataensic</i> follow’d the fallen Tree, and being big with Child, bare a
Daughter, which growing up to years, was Deliver’d of two Daughters, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Taoviscaron</i> and <i>Jouskeha</i>, the eldest of which slew the youngest: By these Fables we
may discern their obscure knowledge of <i>Noah</i>’s Flood, <i>Eve</i>’s Fall, and <i>Cain</i>’s Murder.
No less ridiculous is that which they believe concerning the Creation, <i>viz.</i>
That the Waters were inclos’d within a Frog, which <i>Jouskeha</i> causing to be cut open,
all Streams and Rivers issuing out, had their Original from thence: This done,
<i>Jouskeha</i> open’d a Pit, out of which came all sorts of Beasts; they ascribe a Bodily
shape to the Soul, as also Immortality, but that they live together in a great
Village towards the West; from which removing sometimes, they knock at the
Doors of their former Friends in the Night, and sow deserted Grounds: That the
Journey towards the Village in which the Souls reside is very strange; the Highway
thither beginning at a Rock nam’d <i>Ecaregniendi</i>, where they first Paint their
Faces, which done, they go to a Hut inhabited by an old Man, nam’d <i>Osotrach</i>,
who takes the Brains out of the Souls Head; after which they walk to a broad River,
which they cross on a narrow Plank or Bridge, on which a Dog encountring,
forces them to leap into the Water, which carries them down to the foremention’d
Village. They acknowledge one <i>Oki</i> for the Governor of the Sea, and seasons of
the Year: They also Religiously Worship the Rock <i>Tsankchi Arasta</i>, which they
believe some ages ago was once a Man, but afterward Transform’d into a Rock,
in which a <i>Dæmon</i> resides, who can make their Journies either successful or dangerous,
wherefore they offer him Tobacco. Their opinion of Thunder is likewise
very ridiculous, for they say that the Devil endeavoring to vomit a horrible
Serpent, by straining to evacuate the same, rents the Clouds, and occasions Thunder.
Lastly, They relate of a Dwarf call’d <i>Thakabech</i>, who climb’d on the top of a
Tree, which by his blowing thereon grew so high, that it touch’d the Clouds,
and <i>Thakabech</i> easily stept into them, where he found all sorts of delight and pleasure;
but having a Sister on Earth, descended again along the Tree, and fetching
his Sister, conducted her above the Stars; mean while, <i>Thakabech</i> going in the
Night to see if he had taken any thing in his Net which he had pitch’d, found
it full of Fire, and observing the same very narrowly, saw that he had taken
the Sun, but durst not approach the same, by reason of its great heat; but making
a Mouse, sent her to gnaw the Net in pieces, and set the Sun at liberty. Every
twelfth year they keep an extraordinary great Funeral-Feast; for on the Set-time
they flock from all parts to the appointed place, every one carrying thither the Bodies
or Bones of their Deceas’d Friends, wrapt up in Clothes, and hang them over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>their Meat, which they eat singing; such fond and Superstitious Conceits make up
the Religion of these poor deluded People.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'><i>Nova Scotia</i>, or <i>New Scotland</i>, formerly call’d <i>Accadia</i>, is commonly accounted
a part of <i>New France</i>, (<i>viz.</i> that part which lying on the South side of the
River <i>Canada</i>, and shooting South-Easterly into a bosom of the Sea, forms
it self into a <i>Peninsula</i>, between the Gulph of St. <i>Lawrence</i>, and the Bay <i>Francoise</i>)
nevertheless, because of the different concernments of this part of the Countrey, in
regard the right of claim to several places in this district, most especially of all <i>Nova
Francia</i> besides, hath been long in dispute between <i>Us</i> and the <i>French</i>, it will be
most convenient to Treat of it apart; and because the Series of Affairs, from its
first discovery, till of late years, appears faithfully represented on the <i>English</i> part,
in a Remonstrance Address’d to the King and Council by Sir <i>Lewis Kirk</i>, and his
Brother <i>John Kirk</i> Esquire; it will not be amiss (onely adding some few things upon
occasion) to follow exactly the Narration of Affairs, deliver’d in the said Remonstrance
to this effect.</p>

<p class='c017'>“1. <span class='c006'>T</span>he whole Tract or Space of Land in <i>America</i>, lying on either side of the
River <i>Canada</i>, which a long time since were known by the Names of
<i>Nova Francia</i>, and <i>Nova Scotia</i>, were at first discover’d and found out by the <i>English</i>,
in the time of <i>Henry</i> the Seventh, King of <i>England</i>; which Expedition
was first undertaken at the Command and Charges of that King; afterwards
further’d and carry’d on by the favorable Aspect of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>; so that in
process of time, for many years together, the said Tract of Ground, with absolute
Priviledge of free Commerce, fell under the Jurisdiction and Power of the
Crown of <i>England</i>: Neither was it unto any other <i>Christian</i> Princes, or their Subjects
more clearly known or discover’d, untill about the year 1600. some of the
<i>French</i> understanding the benefit arising by Traffique in the River of St. <i>Lawrence</i>,
having formerly seiz’d upon that Tract of Land, situate on the North side of
the said Floud or River <i>Canada</i>, did afterwards, in <i>Anno 1604.</i> (<i>under the Conduct
of</i> Peter de Gua, <i>Lord</i> of Monts, <i>who in the year 1606. was follow’d by</i> Monsieur
de Pourtrincourt) Possess themselves of <i>L’Accadie</i>, lying on the South side of
the said River, naming the whole <i>Nova Francia</i>, challenging to themselves for
many years, at least <i>de facto</i>, the Possession thereof, with sole liberty of Commerce
there.</p>

<p class='c018'>“2. In <i>Anno 1621.</i> King <i>James</i> of <i>England</i> looking upon the Possession gotten
there by the <i>French</i>, as upon an Invasion, did by his Letters Patents Grant unto
Sir <i>William Alexander</i> a <i>Scotchman</i> (<i>Created afterwards Earl of</i> Sterling, <i>by King</i>
Charles <i>the First</i>) <i>L’Accadie</i>, by the Name of <i>Nova Scotia</i>; who in the year 1622,
and 1623. <i>after Sir</i> Samuel Argal <i>had driven out</i> Biard <i>and</i> Masse, <i>and demolishing their
Fort, carry’d them Prisoners</i> to Virginia; having obtain’d the Possession thereof,
they Planted a Colony therein, and kept Possession for about two years after,
until such time, as upon the Marriage of his Majesty King <i>Charles</i> the First, with
the Lady <i>Henrietta Maria</i>, the said <i>L’Accadie</i>, or <i>Nova Scotia</i>, was by Order of the
King of <i>England</i> return’d into the Possession of the <i>French</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'>“3. Afterwards a War arising between his Majesty King <i>Charles</i> the First, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span><i>Lewis</i> the XIII. <i>Anno 1627.</i> and <i>1628</i>. Sir <i>David Kirk</i> and his Brethren and Relations
of <i>England</i>, did by vertue of his Majestie’s Commission, send to Sea (at their
great charge) first three, afterwards nine Ships, with Warlike Preparations for
recovering of the Possession of the said Lands, lying on either side of the said
River <i>Canada</i>, and to expel and eject all the <i>French</i> Trading in those Parts, wherein
they had good Success; and in <i>Anno 1627.</i> did there seize upon about eighteen
of the <i>French</i> Ships, wherein were found a hundred thirty five Pieces of Ordnance,
design’d for relief of the <i>Royal Fort</i> in <i>L’Accadie</i>, and <i>Quebeck</i> in <i>Nova
Francia</i>, under the Command of <i>Monsieur de Rocmand</i>, and <i>Monsieur de la Tour</i>, Father
of <i>de la Tour</i>, Governor of the said <i>Royal Fort</i>, whom, together with the said
Ships and Guns, they brought into <i>England</i>; and in the year 1628. they Possess’d
themselves of the whole Region of <i>Canada</i> or <i>Nova Francia</i>, situate on the North
side of the River, together with the Fort or Castle of <i>Quebeck</i>, Sir <i>Lewis Kirk</i> being
then constituted Governor of the place, the <i>French</i> being then either expell’d
or convey’d into <i>England</i>, and the Arms of the King of <i>England</i> being publickly
there erected, and every where plac’d; and before the year 1628. it was brought
to pass by the said Sir <i>William Alexander</i>, (assisted both by the advice and charge
of the said <i>Kirk</i>) that in the parts of <i>L’Accadie</i>, or <i>Nova Scotia</i>, on the South side
of the River <i>Canada</i>, the whole place, with the Forts thereon built, being by him
subdu’d, presently came under the Power of the King of <i>England</i>; that Region
on the South side falling into the Possession of the said Sir <i>William Alexander</i>, and
that on the North side, into the Possession of the <i>Kirks</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'>“4. On <i>March 29. 1632.</i> a Peace being concluded between King <i>Charles</i> the
First, and <i>Lewis</i> the XIII. it was amongst other things on the part of the King of
<i>England</i> agreed, That all the Forts, as well in <i>L’Accadie</i> as in <i>Nova Francia</i>, should
be restor’d into the Possession of the Subjects of the <i>French</i> King, which was exactly
perform’d on the part of the <i>English</i>, though to the great damage of the
<i>Kirks</i>; but on the part of the <i>French</i>, although it was agreed, as in the fourth and
fifth Articles of Peace is set down, (to which reference is had) yet nothing was
ever perform’d of their parts; so that the <i>Kirks</i> did thereupon suffer loss, to the
value of five thousand Pounds <i>Sterl.</i> which were to be paid them by <i>Monsieur de
Cane a French-man</i>, but remain unpaid to this day.</p>

<p class='c018'>“5. <i>Anno 1633.</i> the King of <i>England</i> taking notice, that although the Forts and
Castles, according to the League, were deliver’d up into the Possession of the
<i>French</i>, (especially such as had been erected during their Possession thereof) yet
that his <i>English</i> Subjects were not to be excluded from Trade or free Commerce,
in those Regions that were first Discover’d and Possess’d by his Subjects, did,
with the advice of his Council, by his Letters Patents, Dated <i>May 11. 1633.</i> upon
consideration had of the Expences, which the said <i>Kirks</i> had laid out upon the reducing
of that Countrey with the Fort of <i>Quebeck</i>, to the value of 50000<sup>lb.</sup>; and
also of their ready obeisance in resigning up the same on his Royal Command,
Grant unto Sir <i>Lewis Kirk</i>, and his Brother <i>John Kirk</i> and his Associates, for the
term of thirty one years (not yet expir’d) full Priviledge, not only of Trade and
Commerce in the River <i>Canada</i>, and places on either side adjacent, but also to
Plant Colonies, and build Forts and Bulwarks where they should think fit.</p>

<p class='c018'>“6. By vertue of which Commission, Sir <i>Lewis Kirk</i> and his Brother <i>John
Kirk</i>, and his Associates, in the Moneth of <i>February</i> next following, <i>viz.</i> in 1633.
set forth a Ship call’d <i>The Merry Fortune</i>, Laden with Goods of a considerable value,
consign’d to those parts, where during her Trading there, without any just
offence given; and in time of Peace, she was by the <i>French</i> forceably seiz’d on,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>and carry’d into <i>France</i> and her Lading, as if she had been lawful Prize, Confiscated;
whereupon the <i>Kirks</i> suffer’d loss, to the value of twelve thousand Pounds.
And although the Lord <i>Scudamore</i>, Ambassador in <i>France</i>, by the King of <i>Englands</i>
special Command, and the said <i>John Kirk</i> being there in Person, by the King’s
Command, did often earnestly urge, that the Moneys due to the said <i>Kirks</i>, and
the said Ship, with her Lading, might be restor’d, which for no other cause had
been seiz’d upon and sold, but only for that by the King’s Commission she was
found Trading at <i>Canada</i>; yet he could obtain nothing, but after some years
fruitless endeavors return’d into <i>England</i> without accomplishing his desires.</p>

<p class='c018'>“7. In the year 1654. <i>Cromwel</i>, although an unjust Usurper of the Government,
yet upon consideration of the Premises, taking a just occasion for requiring the
Possession of <i>L’Accadie</i>, sends forth several Ships under the Command of one
<i>Sedgwick</i>, who by vertue of the Authority granted him by <i>Cromwel</i>, assaulted and
subdu’d the aforesaid Forts in <i>Nova Scotia</i>, and restor’d them into the Possession
of the <i>English</i>: And although in the year 1655. a League of firm Peace and Amity
being concluded between <i>Cromwel</i> and the <i>French</i> King, the <i>French</i> Ambassador
did often urge the Restitution to the Possession of the <i>French</i>; yet for the same causes
aforesaid, which had mov’d <i>Cromwel</i> to seize upon them, it was thought fit still
to retain the Possession of them; and although according to the purport of the
twenty fifth Article of the Peace, Commissioners on both sides were to be appointed
for the deciding and determining that Controversie; yet nothing was
done therein, neither did the Commissioners ever meet within three Moneths, as
in the twenty fourth Article of the Treaty was provided and agreed: So that
now the case is very clear, that the Possession to the <i>English</i> remains firm and just,
and that the Forts and Bulwarks before specifi’d, are without all peradventure
under the Power and Jurisdiction of the King of <i>England</i>.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Since the Restauration of his present Majesty, the <i>French</i> Ambassador representing
unto the King the Pretensions of the <i>French</i> unto the several Forts and other
places in <i>Accadie</i>, and urging the non-performance of the Articles of Agreement
between <i>Oliver Cromwel</i> and the <i>French</i> King, mov’d the King of <i>England</i>, <i>As a profess’d
Enemy to all Violence</i>, for a Restitution of all the Forts and other places which
were then in the possession of the <i>English</i>: Not long after which, whether upon the
Ambassadors request, or upon other important Affairs intervening, or upon what
other ground soever it were, the <i>French</i> were suffer’d to re-enter on the foresaid
places, and do yet keep Possession of them, till such time as the <i>English</i> claim under
the just Title of the <i>Kirks</i>, shall meet with some fit occasion of being reviv’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>That which we suppose gives the <i>French</i> so much the more confidence in their
claim of this Country, is their presumption upon the Expedition of <i>James Quartier</i>,
whom they will have to be the first Discoverer, if not Possessor, not onely of the
Isle of <i>Assumption</i>, but also of this Coast of <i>Nova Francia</i>, not taking notice it seems
of <i>Sebastian Cabot</i>, under <i>Henry</i> the Seventh.</p>

<p class='c010'>The chief places of Note in this Countrey, are, 1. <i>Port Royal</i>, a Colony of <i>French</i>,
said to have been Planted there by <i>Monsieur de Montz</i> in 1604. by report, capable of
receiving a thousand Ships; and in 1613. (the <i>French</i> being driven out by Sir <i>Samuel
Argal</i>, Governor of <i>Virginia</i>, who took Prisoners <i>Biard</i> and <i>Masse</i>, and demolish’d
the Fort at <i>Port Royal</i>) given by Patent, as aforemention’d, to Sir <i>William Alexander</i>;
afterwards by him sold again to the <i>French</i>; then in the time of <i>Oliver Cromwel</i>
re-taken by Major <i>Sedgwick</i>; lastly, re-possess’d by the <i>French</i>. 2. St. <i>Luke’s Bay</i>,
or <i>Portua Mouton</i>. 3. <i>Gaspe</i>, or <i>Gachepe</i>. 4. <i>The Haven of Passepay.</i> 5. The <i>Bay de Toutes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Isles.</i> 6. <i>The Fort de la Heve.</i> 7. <i>The Cape of Sable.</i> Within the Southern Point <i>Forchu</i>,
lies the Isle <i>Longu</i>, which boasts of a Silver Mine.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most noted People of the ancient Inhabitants of <i>Accadie</i> were the <i>Iroquois</i>, lying
most South-Westerly upon the Sea Coast, who us’d to drive a great Trade in
Beavers and other Commodities.</p>

<p class='c010'>Westerly before the River <i>Chovacoet</i> lies <i>Bacchus Isle</i>, full of Vineyards.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable manner of living.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Inhabitants thereof differ very much from other Salvages, for they shave
all the Hair from the Crown of their Head, wear long Locks behind, pleited together,
and stuck full of Feathers, Paint their Faces black and red, and go arm’d with
Clubs, Bows, Pikes, and Arrows pointed with Fish-bones: They Till their
Ground very handsomly, and divide their Fields with Hedges; they Plant Tobacco,
Vines, Cabbages, <i>Maiz</i>, and divers Colour’d Beans; the stalks of the <i>Maiz</i>
serve in stead of Poles for their Beans to run up upon.</p>

<p class='c010'>Beyond <i>Cape de Rocher</i> lies the brave Harbor <i>Beauport</i>, which is secur’d from all
Winds by an Isle which lies in the midst of it. The Countrey Manur’d in most places,
and Fruitful, feeds store of Men and Cattel.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Haven of <i>Malabar</i> is surrounded in a manner with little Huts, cover’d with
Mats, which in the Middle of the Room have a hole for the Smoke to go out at.
The Southern shore is Sandy, and very dangerous.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the more full exemplification of what concerns this part of <i>Nova Francia</i>, we
shall conclude with an account of all Material Passages relating to the <i>French</i>, from
their own Narrations as followeth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Quartier</i>’s Expedition.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Scurvy, when known.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Exploit of <i>de la Roque</i>.</div>

<p class='c017'>The first discoverer of this Coast was <i>Jaques Quartier</i>, sent out <i>Anno 1534.</i> by the
<i>French</i> King, <i>Francis</i> the First, in which Expedition he spent five Months; and
going from thence to St. <i>Male</i>, discover’d the Inlet <i>Lawrence</i>, <i>Terreneuf</i>, and <i>Natiscotec</i>.
The following year prosecuting his Voyage, he Sail’d into the great River <i>Canada</i>,
and Winter’d near St. <i>Croix</i>, where he lost divers of his Men by the Scurvy, a Distemper
till that time altogether unknown; and such was his condition, that none of
his Men had escap’d with life, had not the Inhabitants taught him to cure the same
with the Bark and Leaves of the Tree <i>Annedda</i>; with which many recovering,
<i>Quartier</i> Weigh’d Anchor, and treacherously carry’d the King <i>Donnacona</i> with many
of his Nobles, Prisoners to <i>France</i>; but most of them dying, <i>Quartier</i> brought only
a few of them back with him in his third Voyage, six years after the first, when arriving
in the Haven St. <i>Croix</i>, he cast up a strong Fort, which he nam’d <i>Charlesbourg
Royal</i>, where he staid a whole Winter. <i>Joan de la Roque</i>, whom the <i>French</i>
King had made Governor of <i>Quartier</i>’s new-discover’d Countries, Sailing thither
with three Ships, met with <i>Quartier</i>’s Fleet near <i>Terreneuf</i>; from whence he was
then going home, because he saw no hopes of subduing the Salvages with so small
a Force as he had brought with him from <i>France</i>. But <i>de la Roque</i> endeavoring to
make a further discovery of <i>Canada</i>, Sail’d up the River <i>Saguenay</i>, where spending
both time and Money, he was Commanded home by the <i>French</i> King, and the fruitless
Expeditions lay dead till about 1604.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of <i>de Monts</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Of <i>Poutrincourt</i>.</div>

<p class='c018'>When <i>Peter de Monts</i> obtaining Letters Patents to Trade for Furs in the foremention’d
Countries, Sail’d with two Ships beyond <i>Accadie</i>, up St. <i>Lawrence Bay</i>,
where he Landed on the Isle St. <i>Croix</i>, where of ninety seven Men, with which he
staid there a whole Winter, he lost thirty five; but having fresh Supplies sent him
from <i>France</i>, he remov’d to <i>Port Royal</i>, where leaving forty Men, he return’d
home; these forty being reduc’d to twenty three, and in great want, walking along
the Sea-shore in a despairing condition, espy’d a Ship coming up with full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Sail, which upon nearer approach, prov’d a <i>French</i> Vessel, of which <i>Poutrincourt</i>
was Commander, who receiving his wretched Countrey-men with great joy, took
them with him to <i>Port Royal</i>, being sent thither on purpose to settle a Plantation
in <i>Accadie</i>: Meanwhile the Letters Patent granted to <i>Monts</i>, being call’d in, the first
Planters in <i>Port Royal</i> were forc’d to desert the same, and return home; and also
<i>Poutrincourt</i> returning, came back again three years after to <i>Port Royal</i>, where finding
the Houses standing as he had left them, he Manur’d the Countrey all about,
and endeavoring to Plant <i>Christianity</i> among the Natives, Christen’d among others
an <i>Accadian</i> Lord, who was above a hundred years old; all which <i>Poutrincourt</i> Sailing
back to France, related at the Court.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable Transactions of some <i>Jesuits</i>.</div>

<p class='c018'>The <i>Jesuits</i> being also inform’d thereof, obtain’d leave of the Queen to send
<i>Peter Biard</i> and <i>Euemond Masse</i> thither, on pretence, that <i>Henry</i> the Fourth had himself
promis’d them the same Priviledge in his Life time. But the Merchants at <i>Diep</i>,
which were concern’d in the new Plantations with <i>Poutrincourt</i>, opposing the going
over of the foremention’d <i>Jesuits</i>, express’d themselves very violent against
them, and laid to their charge the Blood of the late King, which they said was
yet reaking in <i>Paris</i>: <i>What assurance</i> (alleadg’d they) <i>had their Goods which were in the
Custody of Men inclin’d to the</i> Spaniards? <i>Must the</i> Christian Religion <i>be promulgated?
There are so many Orders of</i> Monks <i>which may easily produce two Men; but if the Queen was
resolv’d to send</i> Jesuits <i>thither, they desir’d restauration of the Monies which they had disburs’d</i>:
To which <i>Biard</i> and <i>Masse</i> harkening, gather’d up the demanded Monies,
under pretence of being requir’d towards the Preaching of the <i>Christian Religion</i>
amongst these remote <i>Heathens</i>; by this means getting great Sums, they bought
out the foremention’d Merchants, so that the new Plantations fell half to the <i>Jesuits</i>,
who setting Sail, and arriving at <i>Port Royal</i>, turn’d all things topsiturvy,
and so thwarted <i>Poutrincourt</i> in his designs, that he was forc’d to complain to the
<i>French</i> Court of the <i>Jesuits</i> oppression, whose aim it was to get all things into their
own Possession; whereupon they Excommunicated <i>Poutrincourt</i>’s Son (who serv’d
in his Father’s place at Court), and gain’d the Duke <i>Guereheville</i> in <i>France</i> to be of
their Party, by promising him, that he should share in the new Plantations for a
contracted Sum of Money: After this they receiv’d all sorts of Arms and Ammunition,
with several Brass Guns, of the then King <i>Lewis</i> the XIII. and other gifts
Collected and gather’d out of their several Societies, for two new <i>Accadian</i> Apostles.
<i>Gilbert du Thet</i>, a subtile man of the same Order, transported their Necessaries.</p>

<p class='c018'>At this time all things going favorably with the <i>Jesuits</i>, they made themselves
Masters of <i>Port Royal</i>, and began to raise a Fort on the River <i>Pemtagovet</i>; but there
their happy Proceedings were stop’d, for Captain <i>Argal</i> before-mention’d, Sailing
thither in vindication of the <i>English</i>, was encounter’d by <i>du Thet</i>, (who firing the
first Gun on <i>Argal</i>, was by him taken off with Chain-shot) and taking <i>Biard</i> and
<i>Masse</i>, carry’d them Prisoners to <i>Virginia</i>, and dismantled the Fort built at <i>Port Royal</i>,
after which it was by King <i>James</i> given by Patent to Sir <i>William Alexander</i>, as
hath been already related, together with what of most remarkable hath happen’d
since.</p>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Whence denominated.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Norumbegua</i>, lying between <i>Nova Scotia</i> Northward, and <i>New England</i> Southward,
is so utterly not taken notice of by many as a distinct Province,
that it might seem to be swallow’d up and lost in the two Countreys between
which it lies, or at least to be thought a part of <i>Virginia</i> or <i>New England</i> (for
<i>Virginia</i> largely taken is said to contain <i>New England</i>, <i>Novum Belgium</i>, and <i>Virginia</i>,
especially so call’d) and that so much the rather, because the <i>Bessabees</i>, accounted by
<i>Sanson d’Abbeville</i> an ancient People of <i>New England</i>, are written to have liv’d near
the River <i>Penobscot</i>, which is reckon’d to be the same with <i>Pemtegovet</i>, or (as some
will have it) <i>Norumbegua</i>, from which, or from a certain great City of that Name,
the Country for fancy’s sake must needs be denominated; but since most commonly
we find it nam’d and treated of apart, it will not be improper to follow
that method, carrying the Bounds of <i>New England</i> no farther Northward than the
River <i>Quinnebequi</i> or <i>Sagadahoc</i>, and so determining the main part of this Countrey
to that space between the aforesaid River and <i>Pemtegovet</i>, excepting a small Southerly
portion upon the Banks of the River <i>Chovacovet</i>; so that it appears chiefly
situate under the forty third Degree of Northern Latitude.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and Cities not certainly known.</div>

<p class='c010'>As for the Towns or Cities of this Province, there is but a very uncertain account
to be given, forasmuch as the pretended great City <i>Norumbegua</i>, from whence
the Province should take its Appellation, is not acknowledg’d by any of the most
authentick modern Writers, nor in any late Voyage or Discovery any mention
made either of that or any other considerable Town or City. Dr. <i>Heylin</i> supposeth
it to be no other than <i>Agguncia</i>, a poor little Village, that seems compos’d of a
company of Hutts or Sheaves, cover’d with the Skins of Beasts, or the Barks of
Trees. But the most favourable conjecture is, that it might haply be the Ruines
of an ancient Town, which the Natives call’d <i>Arambeck</i>, and had probably deserted
it long before the arrival of the <i>Europeans</i> in those parts; however, it is not very
probable that the Name of the Countrey should be deriv’d from this City, if ever
there were any such, or from the River, which appears to have been term’d <i>Norumbegua</i>
on purpose to make way for this derivation, whereas <i>Pemtegovet</i> is the ancient
Appellation that properly belongs to it; nor hath any modern one been apply’d
to it but that of <i>Rio Grande</i>, by <i>Buno</i> in his <i>Comment</i> upon <i>Philip Cluverius</i>, upon
what ground is hard to tell, since it is observ’d by <i>Heylin</i> and others, to be neither
large, nor otherwise much to be commended, being Navigable not above twenty
or thirty Miles, in respect of its many great Cataracts and Falls of Water, an Inconvenience
with which many other Rivers of <i>America</i> are prejudic’d, and rendred
impassable.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before and about the Mouth of this River, which is judg’d to be about eight or
nine Miles broad, lie many small Islands, or rather Hills, inviron’d with Water,
the chiefest of which is by the <i>French</i> call’d <i>La Haute Isle</i>, from the high and Mountainous
appearance of it to those that see it from afar off at Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>The aforemention’d <i>Buno</i>, though he names, as belonging to <i>Norumbega</i>, these
several places, <i>viz.</i> <i>Porto del Refugio</i>, <i>Porto Reale</i>, <i>Paradiso</i>, <i>Flora</i>, and <i>Angolema</i>, from
some obscure <i>French</i> testimonies, without particularising any Author, yet he afterwards
confesses, that the Names given by the <i>French</i>, and those apply’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>,
are so various and disagreeing, and breed such a confusion, that no Charts
or Descriptions had concluded upon either.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>As for those who will have <i>Norumbega</i> deriv’d from <i>Norwegia</i>, in respect of a Colony
brought thither from <i>Norwey</i>, if the Etymologie be not a little too much
forc’d, the Invention may pass well enough till a better be found out.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The temperature and nature of its Soil.</div>

<p class='c010'>In this Countrey the temperature of the Air is not bad, nor the Soil unfruitful,
if it were well cultivated, chiefly towards the Rivers, and where it is not either
overgrown with Woods, or craggy with Hills and mountainous Rocks: neither
are the Woods unprofitable, for they afford good Timber, and all kind of necessary
and useful Wood, especially Beeches, Fir-trees, Wallnut-trees, and other Nuts:
The Plains are very pleasant, and yield good Pasturage, onely the Maritime Coasts
are so shallow and full of Sands, that the Sailing near them is accounted somewhat
dangerous; and this may be imagin’d to be the reason that no Authors have
yet met with any Ports or Havens belonging to this Countrey, which they have
thought worthy their notice.</p>

<h3 id='c139' class='c001'>CHAP. II.<br /> New England.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>As <i>Canada</i> is by some accounted a general Province, containing <i>New France</i>,
<i>L’Accadie</i>, <i>Norumbega</i>, and other places, so under <i>Virginia</i> largely taken, are
comprehended <i>New England</i>, <i>New Netherlands</i>, and <i>Virginia</i> properly so
call’d; however, since that part which vulgarly goes under the Name of <i>Virginia</i>
and <i>New England</i> were possess’d, if not discover’d, at several times, and their Plantations
promoted and propagated upon several occasions, and by distinct Interests,
and since <i>New England</i> hath been look’d upon as a place considerable enough for
Persons of very eminent quality to concern themselves in it, we rather are induc’d
to consider this Countrey as a principal part, than as any way depending on, or
being any Branch or Portion of <i>Virginia</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Situation of <i>New England</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>It lies between <i>Norumbega</i>, which it hath Northward, and <i>New Netherlands</i> Southward,
from forty one to forty five Degrees of Northern Latitude, in the midst of
the temperate Zone, and paralell to <i>France</i> and some part of <i>Italy</i> in the Western
Hemisphere, so that one would think it should enjoy the same temperature of
Air; but the contrary is found, for that part which borders upon the Sea is colder,
partly by reason that the Sea-waves break the reflexion of the Sun-beams, partly
by reason of the abundance of Vapors, which mounting upward, abate the ardor
of them; but the more Inland parts of the Countrey are indifferently warm:
Moreover it hath been found by certain experience, that those Countreys which
look towards the East, or Sun-rising, are colder than those which lie towards the
West, or Sun-setting, and those that have the Evening Winds on them, warmer
than those which have the Morning Winds; which being so, it should follow,
that the temperature of the Air in those Regions is peculiar to the Bodies of those
of our Nation, who being accustom’d to a Climate somewhat temperate, are neither
able to endure extremity of Cold, nor immoderate Heat: Yet there are who
affirm, that <i>New England</i>, though situate in the midst of the temperate Zone, nevertheless
feels both extremities of the two opposite Zones, in the Summer the heat
of the Torrid, and in the Winter the cold of the Frigid.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First discovery.</div>

<p class='c010'>As for the first discovery of this Countrey, it is not to be expected otherwise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>than that of the discovery of those other Countreys hitherto discours’d of, that is
to say very uncertain; but because the <i>French</i> boast of <i>Joannes Verrazanus</i> (who though
an <i>Italian</i>, was employ’d by the French King <i>Francis</i> the First) as the first Discoverer,
not onely of <i>Nova Francia</i>, as hath been already intimated, but also of this Countrey
and the adjoyning Coast and Regions, we shall not think it impertinent to
give from their own Relations, a brief view of his Voyage, and afterwards a particular
Description of the <i>English</i> Plantations there, and of their Transactions, both
one with another, and between them and the Nations. The Narration of <i>Verrazanus</i>’s
Voyage is as followeth:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable Voyage of <i>Verrazanus</i>.</div>

<p class='c017'>“On command of the <i>French</i> King <i>Francis</i> the First, <i>John Verrazanus</i>, <i>Anno 1524.</i>
setting Sail Westward from the <i>Canary</i> Isles, discover’d a low <i>American</i> Coast,
in thirty four Degrees North Latitude, inhabited by naked People, which behind
the sandy Hills facing the Sea, Manur’d many fruitful Plains. Then Sailing
a hundred Leagues along the Shore Northerly, he view’d a Countrey full of
Vines, which grew up amongst the Boughs of high Trees; and Sailing up a
pleasant River, Landed on the Island <i>Clandia</i>, full of woody Mountains: thence
he stood for the main Continent; where after having visited a King, Clad in
wrought Deer-skin, he Sail’d by a Bay, at whose Mouth appear’d a Rock in an
Inlet, twenty Leagues; where appear’d five small Isles, all of them exceeding
fruitful. After this (being got a hundred and fifty Leagues to the Northward)
he found very salvage People, whose Heads appear’d through Bear-skins and
Sea-Calves. By this time having <i>Terreneuf</i> on his Starboard, he return’d back to
<i>Diepe</i>.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Thus far <i>Verrazanus</i> made some discovery of the Coast, which hath since not
onely been farther inspected by the <i>English</i>, but also by them Planted and call’d
<i>New England</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The setling of Plantations.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey, whether first discover’d by the said <i>Verrazanus</i>, or together
with the rest of largely-taken <i>Virginia</i>, by Sir <i>Walter Raleigh</i>, or, as some say, by
Captain <i>Gosnald</i>, in the Year 1602. was so well known to the <i>English</i> in the beginning
of King <i>James</i>’s Reign here, that the setling and carrying on of Plantations
in this part of <i>America</i>, was vigorously promoted by many of the most eminent Persons
in <i>England</i>: whereupon it was about the Year 1606. being the fourth Year of
the said King, granted by Patent to several Lords, Knights, Gentlemen and Merchants,
under the denomination of <i>The Plymouth Company</i>, both in favour of those
generous Spirits, who studied and endeavor’d the good of the Publick by foreign
Plantations, and indulgence to those, who not well satisfi’d with the Government
of Church and State, and willingly transporting themselves and Families thither,
as to their <i>Asylum</i>, could more conveniently be spar’d than the better affected part
of the People: And although the Colonies at first sent over succeeded not according
to expectation, yet in a short time there Plantations were brought to very great
perfection. Captain <i>Weimouth</i>, who had been employ’d there by the Lord <i>Arundel</i>
of <i>Warder</i>, for the discovery of the North-West Passage, falling short of his Course,
hapned into a River on the Coast of <i>America</i>, call’d <i>Pemmaquid</i>; from whence he
brought five of the Natives for <i>England</i>, three of whose Names were <i>Mannida</i>,
<i>Skettwarroes</i> and <i>Tasquantum</i>, and Landing at <i>Plymouth</i>, presented them to Sir <i>Ferdinando
Gorges</i>, whom he made use of as Instruments for the farther advancement of
these Plantations: they were all of one Nation, but of several parts, and several
Families; he kept them with him three years, and observing in them an inclination
to vertuous Designs, and Spirits above the Vulgar, he gain’d information from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>them what great Rivers ran up into the Land, what Men of note were seated on
them, what Power they were of, how Ally’d, what Enemies they had, and the
like; and taking some light from thence, sent away a Ship, furnish’d with Men,
and all kind of Necessaries convenient for the Service intended, under the Command
of Captain <i>Henry Chaloung</i>, a Gentleman of a good Family, and very capable
for Undertakings of this nature; and giving him sufficient Instructions what to
do, sent along with him two of the said Natives for his better Conduct and Direction,
ordering him by all means to keep the Northerly Gage as high as <i>Cape
Briton</i>, till they had discover’d the Main, and then to beat it up to the Southward
as the Coast tended, till they found by the Natives they were near the place to
which they were assign’d. By that time they were about a hundred Leagues off the
Island of <i>Canara</i>, the Captain fell sick of a Feaver, and the Winds being Westerly,
his Company shap’d their Course for the <i>Indies</i>, and coming to <i>St. John de Porto
Rico</i>, the Captain went ashore for the recovery of his Health, whilst the Company
took in Water, and such other Provisions as they had present need of, and spent
some time in Hunting, and other Recreations; after which steering their intended
Course, they were met with by the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet that came from the <i>Havana</i>, taken
Prisoners and carried into <i>Spain</i>, the Ship and Goods being confiscated, the Voyage
overthrown, and the Natives lost.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not long after the setting out of <i>Chaloung</i>, <i>Thomas Haman</i> was sent by Sir <i>John
Popham</i>, Lord Chief Justice of <i>England</i>, towards the River of <i>Sagadehoc</i>, to the succour
of <i>Chaloung</i>, if need were; but not finding him, after he had scowr’d the Coast
all about, he return’d back into <i>England</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Captain <i>Prinne</i> was likewise sent from <i>Bristol</i>, who arriving happily in those
Parts, brought back with him at his return the most exact Discovery of that Coast
that ever had been gain’d till then.</p>

<p class='c010'>A while after, at the Charge of the said Sir <i>John Popham</i>, a hundred Men were
sent to settle a Colony at <i>Sagadehoc</i>, under the Command of <i>George Popham</i>, <i>Raleigh
Gilbert</i>, Master of the Ship, who seated themselves in a <i>Peninsula</i>, at the Mouth of
this River; which attempting to discover, they met with a Wood near to an Island,
distant from the Line about forty five Degrees, and some odd Seconds, where they
easily went on Shore. In the Year 1608. the Commander of the Colony deceasing,
and not long after him the Lord Chief Justice, who had been the chief that had
furnish’d them with fresh Supplies, they return’d for <i>England</i> in those Ships that
had been sent them with Succours: At which unexpected return, the Patrons of
the Design were so offended, that for a certain time they desisted from their Enterprizes.
In the mean while the <i>French</i> making use of this occasion, Planted Colonies
in divers places, when Sir <i>Samuel Argal</i> from <i>Virginia</i> disturb’d their Designs,
and brought away Prisoners all he could lay hold on.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly after Captain <i>Hobson</i> and divers others were set out with very great
Preparations, and with them two of the Natives which had been detain’d for
some time in <i>England</i>, whom they thought to have made use of, the better to draw
the rest of the Natives to their Commerce; but because a little before twenty four
of them had been treacherously dealt with by one <i>Hunt</i>, they contracted from
thence so great an animosity towards the <i>English</i>, that Captain <i>Hobson</i> was constrain’d
to return without effecting any thing.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1614. Captain <i>John Smith</i> being sent to Fish for Whales, and seek after
Mines of Gold and Silver, Landed upon the Island of <i>Monahiggan</i>, where he
found some store of Whales, but not such as those by whose Oyl they use to make
so much profit.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>About the same time (two of the Natives being recover’d, <i>Erpenow</i> of <i>Capawick</i>,
that had escap’d from Captain <i>Hobson</i>, and <i>Assacumet</i> of <i>Pemmaquid</i>, one of those
that had been taken Prisoners with <i>Chaloung</i>) Captain <i>Harly</i>, with Necessaries convenient
for such a Voyage, was dispatch’d away by Sir <i>Ferdinando Gorges</i>, the Earl of
<i>Southampton</i> favouring the Design, and furnishing him with some Land-Soldiers
under the Command of Captain <i>Hobson</i>, who not discourag’d with his former ill
Success, resolv’d upon a second Adventure.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1615. Sir <i>Richard Hakings</i> undertook a Voyage into those Parts by
authority of the Council of the second Colony, but by reason of the great Wars
among the Natives, his Observations could not be such as might give any farther
light than what had been already receiv’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>Soon after which Captain <i>Dormer</i> coming for <i>England</i> from <i>New-found-Land</i>, and
Landing at <i>Plymouth</i>, apply’d himself to the Governor, by whom he was dispatch’d
away, with Direction to meet Captain <i>Rocroft</i>, sent away a little before; but <i>Rocroft</i>
being dead by that time <i>Dormer</i> could come after him to <i>Virginia</i>, where he
heard he was, he returning to <i>Capawick</i>, was there set upon by <i>Erpenow</i>, the foremention’d
Salvage, and other <i>Indians</i> that were Conspirators with him; and within
a short while after at <i>Virginia</i>, whither he went to be cur’d of the Wounds he receiv’d
in that Assassination, he fell sick and died.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the Year 1623. Captain <i>Robert Gorges</i>, newly come out of the <i>Venetian</i>
War, was employ’d by the Council of <i>New Englands</i> Affairs as the Lieutenant-General,
to regulate the Abuses of divers Fisher-men and other Interlopers, who
without License frequented those Coasts: for which Service he had assign’d to him
all that part of the main Land situate upon the North-East side of the Bay of the
<i>Messachasets</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>By these several Colonies sent so thick one after another, both a full Discovery
of the Countrey came to be made, and a large gap open’d to the free possession
thereof; yet in regard of the many disappointments and misfortunes the several
Companies sent over met with, and counting the vast Charges their setting forth
cost the Undertakers, which would have been still increas’d by the need of continu’d
Supplies, in all probability <i>New England</i> would have been but thinly peopled
to this day, had not a great Tide of People, possess’d with an aversion to the
Church-Government of <i>England</i>, and fled into <i>Holland</i> for <i>Liberty of Conscience</i>, eagerly
taken hold of this opportunity to make themselves Masters of their own
Opinions, and of a Place where they might erect a Government suitable thereunto:
and though at first there were some Exceptions taken, as if this Countrey
was to be made a Receptacle of Sectaries, and such as condemn’d the Ecclesiastical
Government of the Nation, insomuch that Sir <i>Ferdinando Gorges</i>, to whom they apply’d
themselves, desiring him to mediate for them to the Council of <i>New Englands</i>
Affairs, when they perceiv’d the Authority they had from the <i>Virginia</i> Company,
could not warrant their abode there, had enough to do (notwithstanding his
Apology, <i>That these things hapned contrary to his expectation</i>) to wipe away the jealousie
which was entertain’d of him, it being Order’d, that no more should be suffer’d
to pass into <i>New England</i>, but such as should take the Oaths of Allegiance and
Supremacy: yet at last there was little notice taken who went, perhaps upon consideration,
that the vast resort of People thither would be of greater advantage to
the Plantations, than their different Opinions, at so remote a distance, could be prejudicial,
so long as they acknowledg’d Obedience to the King and Civil Power:
However, Sir <i>Ferdinando</i>, to clear himself the better, mov’d those Lords that were
the chief Actors in the Business, to resign their Grand Patent to the King, and pass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>particular Patents to themselves of such part of the Countrey along the Sea-Coast,
as might be sufficient for them: To this Motion there being a general Assent given
by the Lords, and a Day appointed for the conclusion thereof, an Act was made
for the Resignation of the Patent, alloting to each Man their several Bounds. From
the uttermost parts began the Limits of the Lord <i>Mougrave</i>, and ended at <i>Hudson</i>’s
<i>River</i>. To the Eastward of which River, for the space of sixty Miles in length,
was placed the Duke of <i>Richmond</i>’s Assignment: Next to him was setled the Earl
of <i>Carlile</i>: Next him the Lord <i>Edward Gorges</i>: Next the Marquess of <i>Hamilton</i>:
Then Captain <i>John Mason</i>: And lastly his own, which extended to the great River
<i>Sagadehoc</i>, being sixty Miles, and so up into the Main Land a hundred and twenty
Miles, which he was pleas’d to call by the Name of <i>The Province of Main</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Landing of the <i>English</i> in <i>Plymouth</i> Plantation was very much facilitated by
the great Mortality that hapned amongst the <i>Indians</i> about that time, amongst the
<i>Pecods</i>, <i>Narragansets</i>, <i>Nianticks</i>, <i>Tarantines</i>, <i>Wippanaps</i>, and those of <i>Abargini</i>, <i>Agissawang</i>,
and <i>Pockanekie</i>, their <i>Powwows</i>, or Doctors, seeing with amazement their <i>Wigwams</i>,
or Streets, lie full of dead Bodies, and in vain expecting help from <i>Squantam</i> their
good, or <i>Abbamoch</i> their bad God. Not long before, that blazing Comet, so much
talk’d of in <i>Europe</i>, apppear’d after Sun-setting in their Horizon South-West for the
space of thirty Sleeps, (for so they reckon their Days). They Landed at first
with little or no resistance, a handful of Men onely being sent before to keep
possession for their Companions, who arriv’d eight days after; when the Natives
appearing with their Bowes and Arrows, let flie their long Shafts amongst them;
whereupon one Captain <i>Miles Standish</i> with his Fowling-piece shot the stoutest
<i>Sachem</i> amongst the <i>Indians</i>, as he was reaching an Arrow from his Quiver; which
the rest seeing, fled into the Woods and Thickets.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same Year the <i>Merchant-Adventurers</i> in <i>England</i> sent forth store of Servants to
provide against the Wants of that place; amongst whom came over a mix’d Multitude,
who setled themselves in the Bosom of the Cape now call’d <i>Gloucester</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the Year 1631. there fled to the <i>English</i> at <i>Water-town</i> the <i>Indians</i> that dwelt
thereabouts, for protection against the <i>Tarratines</i>, a sort of cruel and salvage Cannibals,
by whom near the Town of <i>Saugust</i>, in the very dead time of the Night, one
Lieutenant <i>Walker</i> being on a sudden alarm’d, was shot through his Coat and Buff
Jacket with two Indian Arrows. That Night the <i>English</i> stood upon their Guard,
and the next Morning sent word to other parts; who gather’d together, and
taking counsel how to quit themselves of these <i>Indians</i>, agreed to discharge their
great Guns; whose redoubled noise, ratling in the Rocks, struck terror into the <i>Indians</i>,
and caus’d them to betake themselves to flight. The Autumn following, others
of the <i>Indians</i>, who till then had held a good correspondence with the Planters, began
to quarrel about the Bounds of their Land; but a great Mortality, by the raging
of the Small-Pox, breaking out amongst them, put an end to that Controversie:
There died amongst the rest one of the chief of the <i>Sagamores</i> of the <i>Mattachusets</i>,
call’d <i>Sagamore John</i>, who before his Death had been instructed in the <i>Christian</i>
Faith, and took care that his two Sons should be nurtured therein.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1635. there arrived several Ships with great plenty of Provisions,
and many Persons of good Quality, and amongst the rest Sir <i>Henry Vane</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same Year the People of <i>Cambridge</i>, otherwise call’d <i>New-town</i>, hearing of a
fertile place upon the River <i>Canectico</i>, remov’d thither, and erected a new Corporation
by the Name of <i>Banectico</i>, being encourag’d thereunto by the Lord <i>Say</i> and the
Lord <i>Brooks</i>, and planting a Forrest at the mouth of the River, call’d it <i>Saybrook Forrest</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the Year 1638. the <i>Pequods</i>, a stout and Warlike Nation, lying to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>South-West of the <i>Mattachusets</i>, were discover’d upon their March within some few
Miles of <i>Hartford</i>: Their coming very much terrifi’d all that inhabited thereabouts;
but they took onely three Women and return’d; one of whom making a
violent resistance, had her Brains beaten out; the other two they carried away with
them, without abusing their Persons, as it was suppos’d they would, for they
esteem’d their own <i>Shaws</i>, being black, beyond our Women. Their chief Design
was to learn to make Gunpowder; which seeing they could not effect, they look’d
upon their Prize as nothing so precious as they imagin’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>A little after another <i>Indian</i> War threatning the <i>English</i>, they resolv’d together to
send an Ambassador to <i>Cannonicus</i>, chief <i>Sachem</i> of the <i>Naragansits</i>, endeavoring to
prevent him from confederating with the <i>Pequods</i>, who (as they had Intelligence)
were about sending to him to joyn with them: <i>Cannonicus</i> being grown old, had resign’d
the Government to his Nephew <i>Mantinemo</i>, a stern Man, and of a cruel Nature.
The Ambassadors arriving at his Court, which was about eighty Miles from
<i>Boston</i>, the <i>Indian</i> Prince assembled his chief Councellors, and having Entertain’d
the Ambassadors Magnificently, and Feasted them Royally, gave them Audience in
his State-house; where the <i>Sachem</i>, to manifest his greater State, lay along upon
the Ground, with all his Nobility sitting about him, with their Legs doubled up,
and their Knees touching their Chin: The <i>English</i> Interpreter having made his
Speech in the Name of the rest, both <i>Cannonicus</i> and the young King gave discreet
Answers, signifying their Resolutions to keep a fair Correspondence with the <i>English</i>,
and yet not to fall out with the <i>Pequods</i>: Who a little after making also their
Addresses to the same King, he disswaded them by many Reasons from making War
with the <i>English</i>, and to deliver into their hands those Persons that had murther’d
any of them. The <i>Pequods</i> nevertheless, though they seem’d inclinable to his Counsel,
yet they acted as Enemies; for when the <i>English</i> sent a Company of Soldiers
into their Countrey to treat with them about delivering up the Murtherers, they
made shew of willingness, but spying their advantage, betook themselves to
their Heels; and whomsoever they took stragling by surprise, they revil’d and insulted
over in a most cruel manner, vilifying the <i>Christian</i> Religion, and uttering all
the Blasphemies they could invent. Whereupon they rais’d fresh Souldiers for the
War, to the number of fourscore, out of the several Towns in the <i>Mattachusets</i>, and
with some <i>Indian</i> Guides came to their Fort, within which they had pitch’d their
<i>Wigwams</i>, the Entrance being on two sides, with intricate Meanders to enter; at
which were plac’d <i>Indian</i> Bowe-men, who shot the foremost of the <i>English</i>; yet they
had little to boast of in the end, for the <i>English</i> rushing in through the winding
Ways, and placing themselves round the <i>Wigwams</i>, made a very prosperous Shot,
by directing the Muzzles of their Musquets against the <i>Indians</i> which lay sleeping
on the Ground: In the midst of which rouzing terror and confusion they were
defeated with little ado, most of them being either wounded, kill’d, or taken.
The <i>English</i> thus animated with the first Victory, send their Prisoners to the Pinnaces,
and prosecute the War in Hand, marching against the next Body of the <i>Indians</i>,
which lay Encamp’d on a Hill about two Miles distant, where they gave them a
second Overthrow, slaying many more than in the first Engagement; the rest flying
to a very thick inaccessible Swamp or Bog, were there besieg’d by the <i>English</i>; and
skulking up and down, as they saw their opportunity they would Shoot at them
with their Arrows, and then suddenly fall flat along in the Water; at last the <i>English</i>
finding out a Passage into the Swamp, utterly defeated them, and put an end
to the War with the loss of few Mens Lives, and not many wounded.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1640. there came over a fresh Supply of People into <i>New England</i>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>finding no place to settle in within any of the former erected Colonies, they repair’d
to a place call’d <i>Long Island</i>, sever’d from the Continent of <i>New-Haven</i>, about
sixty Miles off the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Year following the four Colonies, namely the <i>Massachusets</i>, <i>Plymouth</i>, <i>Canectico</i>,
and <i>New-Haven</i>, taking into consideration the many Nations that were on all
sides of them, as the <i>French</i>, <i>Dutch</i>, <i>Jews</i>, and native <i>Indians</i>; as also how the three
first went to lay claim to Lands they never had any right to, and the last to be continually
quarrelling and contending, where they saw any hopes of prevailing, by
Commissioners chosen from the respective Colonies, concluded a firm Confederation
to assist each other in all just and lawful Wars; upon which there came in
certain <i>Indian Sachems</i>, as <i>Pomham</i>, <i>Miantonemo</i>, <i>Soccanocoh</i>, and <i>Uncas</i>, who not onely
submitted to the <i>English</i> Government, but also, if occasion were, in matters of
Controversie submitted to their Arbitration: But the Contest between <i>Miantonemo</i>
and <i>Uncas</i> was too hot to be appeas’d, (though the <i>English</i> were not wanting to
interpose) unless by the Blood of one of them, as will appear by the Consequence:
<i>Uncas</i> was a Prince of <i>For</i>, whose Life <i>Miantonemo</i>, though a much more potent
Prince, sought to take away by treachery, hiring a young Man of the <i>Pequod</i> Nation
to murther him, as the following Story renders suspected; for one dark
Evening this <i>Sachem</i> passing from one <i>Wigwam</i> to another, was Shot through the
Arm with an Arrow; but recovering the Palace, had the Arrow pull’d out, and
his Arm cur’d: the young Man that was suspected being examin’d, how he came
by that great store of <i>Wampompeage</i> which was found about him, and being able to
give no good account, it increas’d the suspicion, and induc’d <i>Uncas</i> to complain to
the <i>English</i> at a General Court held at <i>Boston</i>: Whereupon the young Man was
Examin’d in the presence of <i>Miantonemo</i>, who came thither with his Attendants;
but the young Man tutor’d, as suppos’d, by <i>Miantonemo</i>, pretended that <i>Uncas</i> had
enjoyn’d him to feign that he was hir’d by <i>Miantonemo</i> to kill him: To which Tale
of his little belief being given, it was concluded upon farther Examination of him
in private that he had done the Fact: nevertheless they let him depart with <i>Miantonemo</i>,
advising him to send him home to <i>Uncas</i>; but he in stead of returning him cut
off his Head, and forthwith gather’d an Army of a thousand Men to fight with
<i>Uncas</i>; who met him with half the Men: the Battel being joyn’d, the <i>Narragansets</i>,
though the far greater multitude, were beaten by the <i>Wawhiggins</i>, through the Valour
of <i>Uncas</i> their Prince; who perfected his Victory by possessing himself of the
Person of <i>Miantonemo</i>, whom, having put his Life-guard to flight, he carried away
with him in triumph to the Town of <i>Hartford</i>, desiring to have the advice of the
United Colonies what to do with his Prisoner: Whereupon the Commissioners
having had sufficient proof of <i>Miantonemo</i>’s treachery towards this Prince, advis’d
<i>Uncas</i> to put him to death, but not to exercise that barbarous kind of cruelty which
is usual amongst them in these Cases. The <i>Sachem</i>, upon this advice, not long after
pretended to remove him to a safer place, but by the Way caus’d him to be Executed:
His Subjects and Kindred were troubled at his Death, but the little Princes
his Neighbors, over whom he had tyranniz’d, rather rejoyc’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1645, the Sons of old <i>Canonnicus</i>, their Father being dead, began to
fall into hot Contentions with their Neighbors, and being forbidden by the United
Colonies, they did not stick to threaten Wars to the <i>English</i> also. Whereupon the
Commissioners rais’d an Army of Horse and Foot, and made Major General
<i>Edward Gibbons</i> Commander in Chief over them. But the <i>Indians</i> hearing of this
Preparation, sent some of their chief Nobility to the Commissioners of the United
Colonies, who were assembled at <i>Boston</i>, to Treat about Peace; to which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Commissioners agreed, upon condition they should pay a part of the Charges of
the War; and that they should send four of their Sons for Hostages till the Sum
was paid; and the Hostages being sent back before the <i>Wapom</i> was all paid, the two
Princes, <i>Pesicus</i> and  <i>Mexanimo</i>, upon the sending a Company of Armed Men to demand
it, sent the remainder of the Money.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1647. divers Persons of Quality ventur’d their Estates upon an Iron
Mill, which they began at <i>Braintree</i>, but it profited the Owners little, rather wasting
their Stock, the price of Labor in matters of that nature, being double or treble to
what it is in <i>England</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>These are the most material Transactions we find deliver’d by any one which
hapned from the first discovery till the Year before mention’d: what hath hapned
from that time to this, chiefly relates to the several Revolutions that have been in
<i>England</i>, and shall be therefore taken notice of when we come to speak of the Government
of these Plantations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Commodities of this Countrey, together with the Trees and other sorts of Plants.</div>

<p class='c010'>Though there are, who having remain’d some time, and been concern’d in those
Parts, affirm the Soil of <i>New England</i> to be nothing so fruitful as it is believ’d and
commonly deliver’d to be, yet we think it not improper to give a brief account of
the Trees and other Plants; also the Beasts, Birds, Fishes, and other Commodities
which most Writers will have to be the production of this Countrey, especially
since we find them compactly summ’d up by an unknown Writer in the Language
of the <i>Muses</i>. The recital of the Plants and Trees, which (excepting the Cedar,
<i>Sassafras</i>, and Dyers <i>Sumach</i>) are all of the same kind with those that grow in <i>Europe</i>,
onely differing in nature, according as the Epithets of many of them declare,
is as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Trees both in Hills and Plains in plenty be;</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Beasts.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Beasts peculiar to this Countrey are the <i>Moose</i>, the <i>Rackoon</i>, and the <i>Musquash</i>;
the two first Land-Animals, the last Amphibious, which with others common
to them with us, are thus versifi’d by the abovesaid Author:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>The Kingly Lyon, and the strong-arm’d Bear;</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The large limb’d Mooses, with the tripping Deer;</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Quill-darting Porcupines, that Rackoons be</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Castled ith’ hollow of an aged Tree;</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The skipping Squirrel, Rabbet, purblind Hare,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Immured in the self-same Castle are,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Lest red-ey’d Ferrets, wily Foxes should,</i></div>

      <div class='line'><i>Black glittering Otters, and rich Coated Beaver;</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The Civet-scented Musquash smelling ever.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Of such of these as are altogether unknown to us, take these brief Descriptions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Moose</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Beast call’d a <i>Moose</i>, is not much unlike red Deer, and is as big as an Ox,
slow of Foot, Headed like a Buck, with a broad Beam, some being two Yards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>wide in the Head, their flesh is as good as Beef, their Hides good for Clothing;
if these were kept tame, and accustom’d to the Yoke, they would be a great Commodity:
First, because they are so fruitful, bringing forth three at a time being
likewise very uberous: Secondly, because they will live in Winter without any
Fodder. There are not many of these in the <i>Massachusets</i> Bay, but forty Miles to the
North-East there are great store of them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Rackoon</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Rackoon</i> is a deep Furr’d Beast, not much unlike a Badger, having a Tail
like a Fox, as good Meat as a Lamb: These Beasts in the day time sleep in hollow
Trees, in a Moon-shine night they go to feed on Clams at a low Tide, by the
Sea side, where the <i>English</i> hunt them with their Dogs.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Musquash</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Musquash</i> is much like a Beaver for shape, but nothing near so big; the
Male hath two Stones, which smell as sweet as Musk, and being kill’d in Winter,
never lose their sweet smell: These Skins are no bigger than a Coney-skin, yet
are sold for five Shillings apiece, being sent for Tokens into <i>England</i>; one good
Skin will perfume a whole house full of Clothes, if it be right and good.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Birds.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Birds both common and peculiar are thus recited.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

      <div class='line'><i>Whom in their unknown ways there’s none can chawk:</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The Humbird for some Queens rich Cage more fit,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Than in the vacant Wilderness to sit.</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The swift-wing’d Swallow sweeping to and fro,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>As swift as Arrow from</i> Tartarian <i>Bowe.</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>When as</i> Aurora’s <i>Infant day new springs,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>There th’morning mounting Lark her sweet lays sings.</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The harmonious Thrush, swift Pigeon, Turtle-dove,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Who to her Mate doth ever constant prove:</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The</i> Turky-<i>Pheasant, Heath-cock, Partridge rare,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The Carrion-tearing Crow, and hurtful Stare,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The long-liv’d Raven, th’ominous Screech-Owl,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Who tells, as old Wives say, disasters foul.</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The drowsie Madge that leaves her day-lov’d Nest,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>And loves to rove, when Day-birds be at rest:</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Th’Eel-murthering Hearn, and greedy Cormorant,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>That near the Creeks in morish Marshes haunt.</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The bellowing Bittern, with the long-leg’d Crane,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Presaging Winters hard, and dearth of Grain.</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The Silver Swan that tunes her mournful breath,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>To sing the Dirge of her approaching death.</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The tattering Oldwives, and the cackling Geese,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The fearful Gull that shuns the murthering Peece.</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The strong-wing’d Mallard, with the nimble Teal,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>And ill-shape’t Loon, who his harsh Notes doth squeal.</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>There Widgins, Sheldrakes and Humilitees,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Snites, Doppers, Sea-Larks, in whole million flees.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Of these the <i>Humbird</i>, <i>Loon</i>, and <i>Humility</i> are not to be pass’d by without particular
observation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Humbird</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Humbird</i> is one of the wonders of the Countrey, being no bigger than a
Hornet, yet hath all the Dimensions of a Bird, as Bill, and Wings with Quills, Spider-like
Legs, small Claws: for Colour, she is as glorious as the Rain-bow; as she
flies, she makes a little humming noise like a Humble-bee, wherefore she is call’d
the <i>Humbird</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Loon</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Humility</i>, or <i>Simplicity</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Loon</i> is an ill-shap’d thing like a Cormorant, but that he can neither go nor
flie; he maketh a noise sometimes like Sowgelders Horn. The <i>Humilities</i> or <i>Simplicities</i>
(as we may rather call them) are of two sorts, the biggest being as large as a
green Plover; the other as big as Birds we call <i>Knots</i> in <i>England</i>. Such is the simplicity
of the smaller sorts of these Birds, that one may drive them on a heap like
so many Sheep, and seeing a fit time shoot them; the living seeing the dead, settle
themselves on the same place again, amongst which the Fowler discharges again:
These Birds are to be had upon Sandy Brakes, at the latter end of Summer before
the Geese come in.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fishes.</div>

<p class='c010'>No less Poetical a Bill of Fare is brought of the Fish on the Sea-Coasts, and in the
Rivers of <i>New England</i> in these subsequent Verses.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Seal</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>To speak of the most unusual of these sorts of Fish; First the <i>Seal</i>, which is
call’d the <i>Sea-Calf</i>, his Skin is good for divers uses, his Body being between Flesh
and Fish, it is not very delectable to the Palate, or congruent with the Stomack;
his Oil is very good to burn in Lamps, of which he affords a great deal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Shark</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Shark</i> is a kind of Fish as big as a Man, some as big as a Horse, with three
rows of Teeth within his Mouth, with which he snaps asunder the Fishermans
Lines, if he be not very circumspect: This Fish will leap at a Mans hand if it be
over board, and with his Teeth snap off a Mans Leg or Hand if he be Swimming;
these are often taken, being good for nothing but Manuring of Land.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Hollibut</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Hollibut</i> is not much unlike a Pleace or Turbut, some being two yards long,
and one wide, a Foot thick; the plenty of better Fish makes these of little esteem,
except the Head and Finns, which Stew’d or Bak’d is very good; these <i>Hollibuts</i> be
little set by while <i>Basse</i> is in season.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Basse</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Basse</i> is one of the best Fishes in the Countrey, and though Men are soon
weary’d with other Fish, yet are they never with <i>Basse</i>; it is a delicate, fine, fat, fast
Fish, having a Bone in his Head which contains a Sawcerful of Marrow, sweet
and good, pleasant to the Palate, and wholsom to the Stomack: When there be
great store of them, we only eat the Heads, and Salt up the Bodies for Winter,
which exceeds Ling or Haberdine: Of these Fishes some are three, and some four
Foot long, some bigger, some lesser; at some Tides a Man may catch a dozen or
twenty of these in three hours; the way to catch them is with Hook and Line:
The Fisherman taking a great Cod-line, to which he fasteneth a piece of Lobster,
throws it into the Sea, the Fish biting at it, he pulls her to him, and knocks her
on the head with a Stick.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Alewives.</i></div>

<p class='c010'><i>Alewives</i> are a kind of Fish which is much like a Herring, which in the later end
of <i>April</i> come up to the fresh Rivers to Spawn, in such multitudes as is almost incredible,
pressing up in such shallow Waters as will scarce permit them to Swim,
having likewise such longing desire after the fresh Water Ponds, that no beatings
with Poles, or forcive agitations by other devices, will cause them to return to the
Sea, till they have cast their Spawn.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Clamms</i> or <i>Clamps</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Clamms</i> or <i>Clamps</i>, are a Shell-fish not much unlike a Cockle, they lie under the
Sand and have every one of them a round hole to take Air, and receive Water
at. When the Tide ebbs and flows, a Man running over these <i>Clamm</i> banks will
presently be made all wet, by their spouting of Water out of those small holes:
These Fishes are in great plenty in most places of the Countrey, which is a great
Commodity for the feeding of Swine, both in Winter and Summer; for being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>once us’d to those places, they will repair to them as duly every Ebb, as if they
were driven to them by Keepers: In some places of the Countrey there be <i>Clamms</i>
as big as a Peny white Loaf, which are great Dainties amongst the Natives, and
would be in great esteem amongst the <i>English</i>, were it not for better Fish.</p>

<p class='c010'>Other Commodities which this Countrey is said to yield, are, in down-right
Prose, Furrs, Flax, Linnen, Iron, Pitch, Masts, Cables, and some quantity of Amber;
so that if what many Authors have consented to assert concerning <i>New England</i>
be not a meer Fiction, what e’re hath been affirm’d of the unfruitfulness of the
Country will demonstrably be found invalid.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Noxious Creatures.</div>

<p class='c010'>There are also to be found here some hurtful Creatures, of which, that
which is most injurious to the Person and Life of a Man is the <i>Rattle-Snake</i>,
which is generally a yard and a half long, as thick in the middle as the small of a
Mans Leg; she hath a yellow Belly, her Back being spotted with black, russet,
yellow, and green colours, plac’d like Scales; at her Tail is a Rattle, with which
she makes a noise when she is molested, or when she seeth any approach near her;
her Neck seems to be no thicker than a Mans Thumb, yet she can swallow a
Squirril, having a great wide Mouth, with Teeth as sharp as Needles, wherewith
she biteth such as tread upon her, her Poyson lyeth in her Teeth, for she hath no
Sting. When any Man is bitten by any of these Creatures, the Poyson spreads so
suddenly through the Veins, and so runs to the Heart, that in one hour it causeth
Death, unless he hath the Antidote to expel the Poyson, which is a Root call’d
<i>Snake-weed</i>, which must be champ’d, the Spittle swallow’d, and the Root apply’d
to the Sore; this is present Cure against that which would be present death without
it: This Weed is rank Poyson, if it be taken by any man that is not bitten;
whosoever is bitten by these Snakes, his flesh becomes as spotted as a Leopard, until
he be perfectly cur’d. It is reported, that if the Party live that is bitten, the Snake
will die, and if the Party die, the Snake will live. This is a most Poysonous and
dangerous Animal, yet nothing so bad as the report goes of it in <i>England</i>; for
whereas it is said to kill a Man with its breath, and that it can flie, there is no such
matter, for it is naturally the most sleepy and unnimble Creature that lives, never
offering to leap or bite any Man, if it be not trodden on first; and it is their desire
in hot weather to lie in Paths, where the Sun may shine on them, where they will
sleep so soundly, that I have known four Men stride over one of them, and never
awake it; five or six Men have been bitten by them, which by using of <i>Snake-weed</i>
were all cur’d, never any yet losing his life by them. Cows have been bitten, but
being cut in divers places, and this Weed thrust into their flesh, were cur’d; A small
Switch will easily kill one of these Snakes. In many places of the Country there be
none of them, as at <i>Plymouth, New-town, Igowamme, Nahant, &amp;c.</i> In some places they
will live on one side of the River, and swimming but over the Water, as soon as
they are come into the Woods, they turn up their yellow Bellies and die. Up into
the Countrey, Westward from the Plantations, is a high Hill, which is call’d <i>Rattle-Snake-Hill</i>,
where there are great store of these Poysonous Creatures.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are likewise troublesome Flies.</p>

<p class='c010'>First there is a wild Bee or Wasp, which commonly guards the Grape, building
by Cobweb habitation amongst the Leaves: Secondly a great green Flie, not
much unlike our Horse-Flies in <i>England</i>; they will nipp so sore, that they will
fetch Blood either of Man or Beast, and are most troublesome where most Cattel
are, which brings them from out of the Woods to the Houses; this Flie continues
but for the Moneth of <i>June</i>. The third is <i>Gurnipper</i>, which is a small black Flie, no
bigger than a Flea; her biting causeth an itching upon the Hands or Face, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>provoketh scratching, which is troublesome to some; this Flie is busie but in close
Mornings or Evenings, and continues not above three Weeks; the least Wind or
heat expels them. The fourth is a <i>Musketor</i>, which is not unlike to our Gnats in
<i>England</i>; in places where there is no thick Woods or <i>Swamps</i>, there are none or very
few. In the new Plantations they are troublesome for the first year, but the
Wood decaying they vanish: These Flies cannot endure Wind, heat or cold, so
that these are only troublesome in close thick Weather, and against Rain, many that
are bitten will fall a scratching, whereupon their Faces and Hands swell.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The nature of the ancient Inhabitants.</div>

<p class='c010'>As touching the Nature of the ancient Inhabitants, they are to be consider’d according
to their several Shires or Divisions; those that inhabit to the East and
North-East bore the name of <i>Churchers</i> and <i>Tarrenteens</i>; those in the Southern parts
were call’d <i>Pequods</i>, and <i>Narragansets</i>; those Westward, <i>Connectacuts</i> and <i>Mowhacks</i>;
to the North-West, of whom were the <i>Aberginians</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The nature of the <i>Mowhacks</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Mowhacks</i> were ever accounted a cruel bloudy People, which were wont to
come down upon their poor Neighbors, with more than bruitish Savageness, spoiling
their Corn, burning their Houses, slaying Men, ravishing Women, yea very
<i>Canibals</i> they were, sometimes eating on a Man one part after another before his
Face, and while yet living; insomuch, that the very Name of a <i>Mowhack</i> would
strike the Heart of a poor <i>Aberginian</i> dead, till they had the <i>English</i> on their sides to
succor them; for these inhumane Homicides confess that they dare not meddle
with a white Fac’d Man, accompany’d with his hot-mouth’d Weapon.</p>

<p class='c010'>These <i>Indians</i> are a People of tall Stature, long grim Visages, slender Wasted,
and having exceeding great Arms and Thighs, wherein they say their strength
lieth; which is such, that one of them hath been known to kill a Dog with a fillip
of his Finger, and afterwards to have flead and sod him, and eat him to his Dinner.
They are so hardy, that they can eat such things as would make other <i>Indians</i>
sick to look upon; being destitute of Fish and Flesh, they suffice Hunger and maintain
Nature with the use of Vegetatives; but that which they most hunt after, is
the flesh of Man: Their custom is, if they get a stranger near their Habitations, not
to Butcher him immediately, but keep him in as good plight as they can, feeding
him with the best Victuals they have.</p>

<p class='c010'>These <i>Indians</i> are more desperate in Wars than the other <i>Indians</i>, which proceeds
not only from the fierceness of their Natures, but also in that they know themselves
to be better Arm’d and Weapon’d; all of them wearing Sea Horse Skins and Barks
of Trees, made by their Art as impenetrable, it is thought, as Steel, wearing Head-Pieces
of the same, under which they March securely and undantedly, running,
and fiercely crying out, <i>Hadree Hadree succomee succomee</i>, <i>We come to suck your
Blood</i>, not fearing the feather’d shafts of the strong-arm’d Bow-men, but like unruly
headstrong Stallions, beat them down with their right-hand <i>Tamahawks</i>, and left-hand
Javelins, being all the Weapons which they use, counting Bowes a cowardly
fight. <i>Tamahawks</i> are Staves of two Foot and a half long, with knobs at one end as
round and big as a Foot ball; a Javelin is a short Spear, headed with sharp Sea-Horse
Teeth; one blow or thrust with these sharp Weapons, will not need a second
to hasten death from a <i>Mowhacks</i> arm.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The nature of the <i>Indians</i> inhabiting Eastward.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Tarrenteens</i> saving that they eat not Mans flesh, are little less Salvage and
cruel than these <i>Cannibals</i>; our <i>Indians</i> do fear them as their deadly Enemies, for so
many of them as they meet, they kill. Take these <i>Indians</i> in their own proper and natural
disposition, and they are reported to be wise, lofty-spirited, constant in
friendship to one another, true in their promise, and more industrious than many
others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The nature of the <i>Pequods</i> and <i>Narragansets</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>The <i>Pequants</i> are a stately Warlike People, just and equal in their dealings; not
treacherous either to their Country-men, or <i>English</i>, to whom (except in time of
War) they were not any ways uncivil. Their next Neighbors the <i>Narragansets</i>, are
the most numerous People in those Parts, the most rich also, and the most industrious;
being the Store-house of all such kind of wild Merchandize as is amongst
them. These Men are the most curious Minters of their <i>Wampompeage</i> and <i>Mowhakes</i>,
which they form out of the inmost Wreaths of Periwinkle-shells. The Northern,
Eastern, and Western <i>Indians</i> fetch all their Coyn from these Southern Mint-Masters.
From hence they have most of their curious Pendants and Bracelets, from
hence they have their great Stone Pipes, which will hold a quarter of an Ounce
of Tobacco, which they make with Steel Drills and other Instruments; such is
their Ingenuity and dexterity, that they can imitate the <i>English</i> Mold so accurately,
that were it not for matter and colour, it were hard to distinguish them; they
make them of green, and sometimes of black Stone; they are much desir’d of our
<i>English</i> Tobacconists, for their rarity, strength, handsomness, and coolness. Hence
likewise our <i>Indians</i> had their Pots, wherein they us’d to seeth their Victuals before
they knew the use of Brass. Since the <i>English</i> came, they have employ’d most of
their time in catching of Beavers, Otters, and <i>Musquashes</i>, which they bring down
into the Bay, returning back loaden with <i>English</i> Commodities, of which they
make double profit, by selling them to more remote <i>Indians</i>, who are ignorant
at what cheap rates they obtain them, in comparison of what they make them pay,
so making their Neighbors ignorance their enrichment: They were never known
to be desirous to take in hand any Martial Enterprize, or expose themselves to the
uncertain events of War; wherefore the <i>Pequants</i> call them <i>Women-like Men</i>, resting
secure under the conceit of their popularity, and seeking rather to grow rich by industry,
than famous by deeds of Chivalry.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The nature and complexion of the <i>Aberginians</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Most of these Northward <i>Indians</i> are between five and six Foot high, straight Body’d,
strongly compos’d, smooth Skin’d, merry Countenanc’d, of Complexion
more swarthy than the <i>Spaniards</i>, black Hair’d, high Foreheaded, black Ey’d, out-Nos’d,
broad Shoulder’d, brawny Arm’d, long and slender Handed, out Breasted,
small Wasted, lank Belly’d, well Thigh’d, flat Kneed, with handsome grown Legs,
and small Feet: In a word, take them when the Blood skips in their Veins, when the
Flesh is on their Backs, and Marrow in their Bones, when they frolick in their antique
Deportments and <i>Indian</i> Postures, they are more amiable to behold (though
onely in <i>Adam</i>’s Livery) than many a trim Gallant in the newest Mode; and
though their Houses are but mean, their Lodging as homely, Commons scant, their
Drink Water, and Nature their best Clothing, yet they still are healthful and lusty.
Their smooth Skins proceed from the often anointing of their Bodies with the Oyl
of Fishes, and the fat of Eagles, with the grease of <i>Rackoons</i>, which they hold in
Summer the best Antidote to keep their Skin from blistering with the scorching
Sun; it is their best Armor against the <i>Musketoes</i>, and the surest abrasour of the
hairy Excrement, and stops the Pores of their Bodies against the nipping Winters
cold. Their black Hair is natural, yet is brought to a more Jetty colour by Oyling,
Dying, and daily dressing; sometimes they wear it very long, hanging down
in a loose dishevel’d Womanish manner, otherwise ty’d up hard and short like a
Horse Tail, bound close with a Fillet, which they say makes it grow the faster;
they are not a little Phantastical in this particular; their Boys being not permitted
to wear their Hair long till sixteen years of Age, and then they must come to it
by degrees; some being cut with a long foretop, a long lock on the Crown, one
of each side of his Head, the rest of his Hair being cut even with the Scalp; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>young Men and Soldiers wear their Hair long on the one side, the other being
cut short like a Screw; other cuts they have as their Fancy leads them, which
would torture the Wits of the most exact Barber to imitate. But though they are
thus proud of the Hair of their Head, you cannot wooe them to wear it on their
Chins, where it no sooner grows, but it is stubb’d up by the roots, for they count
it as an unuseful, cumbersome, and opprobrious excrement, insomuch as they call
him an <i>English</i> Mans Bastard that hath but the appearance of a Beard.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Apparel, Ornaments, Paintings, and other artificial Deckings of the <i>Indians</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Cloathing of the <i>Indians</i> is only a pair of <i>Indian</i> Breeches to cover their secret
Parts, which is but a piece of Cloth a yard and a half long, but between their
Groins, ty’d with a Snakes Skin about their middles, one end hanging down with
a flap before, the other like a tail behind. In the Winter time, the more Aged of
them wear Leather Drawers, in form like <i>Irish</i> Trouses, fasten’d under their Girdle
with Buttons: They wear Shooes likewise of their own making, cut out of a <i>Mooses</i>
Hide; many of them wear Skins about them, in form of an <i>Irish</i> Mantle, and of
these some are Bears Skins, <i>Mooses</i> Skins, and Beaver Skins sew’d together, others Otter
Skins, and <i>Rackoon</i> Skins; most of them in the Winter having his deep Furr’d Cat
Skin, like a large Muff, which he shifts to that Arm which lieth most expos’d to
the Wind. Although they are poor, yet is there in them the sparks of natural
Pride, which appears in their longing desire after many kind of Ornaments, wearing
Pendants in their Ears, in form of Birds, Beasts, and Fishes, Carv’d out of
Bone, Shells, and Stone, with long Bracelets of their curious wrought <i>Wampompeage</i>
and <i>Mowhackees</i>, which they put about their Necks and Loins; these they count a
rare kind of Decking; many of the better sort bearing upon their Cheeks certain
Pourtraitures of Beasts, as Bears, Deers, <i>Mooses</i>, Wolves, <i>&amp;c.</i> some of Fowls, as of
Eagles, Hawks, <i>&amp;c.</i> which is not a superficial Painting, but a certain Incision, or
else a raising of their Skin by a small sharp Instrument, under which they convey
a certain kind of black unchangeable Ink, which makes the desir’d form apparent
and permanent. Others have certain round Impressions down the outside of their
Arms and Breasts, in form of Mullets or Spur-rowels, which they imprint by searing
Irons: Whether these be Foils to illustrate their unparallel’d Beauty (as they
deem it) or Arms to blazon their antique Gentility, cannot easily be determin’d:
But a <i>Segamore</i> with a <i>Humbird</i> in his Ear for a Pendant, a black Hawk on his Head
for his Plume, <i>Mowhackees</i> for his Gold Chain, good store of <i>Wampompeage</i> begirting
his Loins, his Bowe in his Hand, his Quiver at his Back, with six naked <i>Indian</i>
Lacquies at his Heels for his Guard, thinks himself little Inferior to the great
<i>Cham</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Diet, Cookery, Meal-times, and Hospitality at their Kettles.</div>

<p class='c010'>In Winter time they have all manner of Fowls and Beasts of the Land and Water,
Pond-fish, with <i>Cathaires</i> and other Roots, <i>Indian</i> Beans and <i>Clamms</i>; in the Summer
they have all manner of Sea-fish, with all sorts of Berries. For the ordering
of their Victuals, they Boil or Roast them, having large Kettles which they Traded
for with the <i>French</i> long since, and do still buy of the <i>English</i> as their need requires,
before they had substantial Earthen Pots of their own making. Their Spits are no
other than cloven Sticks, sharpen’d at one end to thrust into the ground; into
these cloven Sticks they thrust the Flesh or Fish they would have Roasted, behemming
a round fire with a dozen of Spits at a time, turning them as they see occasion.
They seldom or never make Bread of their <i>Indian</i> Corn, but seethe it whole
like Beans, eating three or four Corns with a mouthful of Fish or Flesh, sometimes
eating Meat first, and Corns after, filling the Chinks with their Broth. In Summer,
when their Corn is spent, <i>Sqoutersquashes</i> is their best Bread, a Fruit like a young
Pumpion: But as all are fellows at Foot-ball, so they all meet Friends at the Kettle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>saving their Wives, that Dance a Spaniel-like attendance at their Backs for
their Fragments. If their occasions cause them to Travel, the best of their Victuals
for their Journey is <i>Nocake</i>, (as they call it) which is nothing but <i>Indian</i> Corn
parch’d in the hot Ashes; the Ashes being sifted from it, it is afterwards beaten to
Powder, and put into a long Leathern Bag, truss’d at their Back like a Knapsack,
out of which they take thrice three Spoonfuls a day, dividing it into three Meals.
If it be Winter, and Snow be on the ground, they can eat when they please, making
use of Snow for their Drink; in Summer, they must stay till they meet with a
Spring or Brook; with this strange <i>viaticum</i> they will travel four or five days together.
They keep no Set-Meals, their Store being spent, they champ on the Bit,
till they meet with fresh Supplies, either from their own endeavors, or their Wives
industry, who trudge to the <i>Clam-banks</i> when all other means fail. Though they
are sometimes scanted, yet are they as free as Emperors, both to their Countrey-men
and <i>English</i>, be he stranger, or near acquaintance; counting it a great discourtesie,
not to eat of their high-conceited Delicates.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of their hardiness.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their hardiness is much to be admir’d, no ordinary pains making them so much
as alter their countenance; beat them, whip them, punch them, if they put on a
resolution, they will not winch for it; whether it be their benumm’d insensibleness
of smart, or their hardy resolutions, is hard to resolve; It might be a <i>Perillus</i>
his Bull, or the Rack might force an out-cry from them, but a <i>Turkish</i> drubbing
would not move them, the unexpected approach of a mortal Wound by a Bullet,
Arrow, or Sword, striking no more terror, nor causing no more exclamation
in them, than if it had been a shot into the body of a Tree; such Wounds as would
be sudden death to an <i>English</i> Man, would be nothing to them; whether it be,
that by their rare skill in the use of Vegetatives, or by Diabolical Charms, they cure
them; nevertheless, the very name and thoughts of death is so hideous to them, or
any thing that presents it so terrible, that a hundred of them will run from two or
three arm’d with Guns. In the Night they need not to be feared, for they will not
budge from their own Dwellings, for fear of their <i>Abamacho</i> (the Devil) whom
they much fear, specially in evil enterprizes, they will rather lie by an <i>English</i> fire
than go a quarter of a Mile in the dark to their own Dwellings; but they are well
freed from this Scare-crow since the coming of the <i>English</i>, and less care for his delusions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of their Kings, Government, and Subjects obedience.</div>

<p class='c010'>Now for the matter of Government amongst them; it is the custom of their
Kings to inherit, the Son always taking the Kingdom after his Fathers death. If
there be no Son, then the Queen rules; if no Queen, the next to the Blood-Royal;
who comes in otherwise, is but counted an usurping Intruder, if his fair carriage
bear him not out the better, they will soon Unscepter him. Some say the chief
<i>Powahe</i> is next in Dignity and Authority to the King, and when he dies, Marries the
<i>Squasachem</i>, or Queen.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kings have no Laws to Command by, nor have they any annual Revenues;
yet commonly are they so either fear’d or beloved, that half their Subjects estate is
at their Service, and their Persons at his Command, by which Command he is
better known than by any thing else; for though he hath no Kingly Robes to make
him glorious in the view of his Subjects, nor daily Guards to succor his Person, nor
Court-like attendance, nor sumptuous Palaces; yet do they yield all submissive
subjection to him, accounting him their Soveraign; going at his Command, and
coming at his Beck, not so much as expostulating the cause, though it be in matters
thwarting their wills; he being accounted a disloyal Subject that will not effect
what his Prince Commands. Whosoever is known to Plot Treason, or to lay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>violent hands on his lawful King, is presently Executed. Once a Year he takes his
Progress, accompanied with a dozen of his best Subjects, to view his Countrey, to
recreate himself, and establish good Orders. When he enters into any of their
Houses, without any more Complement, he is desir’d to sit down on the Ground,
(for they use neither Stools nor Cushions) and after a little respite all that are present
come in, and sit down by him, one of his Seniors pronouncing an Oration
gratulatory to his Majesty for love, and the many good things they enjoy under
his peaceful Government. A King of large Dominions hath his Vice-Roys, or inferior
Kings under him, to agitate his State Affairs, and keep his Subjects in good
Decorum. Other Officers there are, but how to distinguish them by Name is something
difficult. For their Laws, as their Vices come short of many other Nations,
so they have not so many Laws, though they are not without some, which they inflict
upon notorious Malefactors, as Traitors to their Prince, inhumane Murtherers,
and, some say, Adulterers: for Theft, as they have nothing to steal worth the
Life of a Man, therefore they have no Law to Execute for Trivials, a Subject being
more precious in the Eye of his Prince, than, where Men are so scarce, to be cast
away upon so sleight a matter. A Malefactor having deserv’d Death, and being
apprehended, is brought before the King, and some other of the wisest Men, where
they enquire out the original of the thing, after proceeding by aggravation of Circumstances
he is found Guilty, and Cast by the Jury of their strict Inquisition, he
is Condemn’d and Executed in the following manner: The Executioner comes
in, who blind-folds the Party, sets him in the publick view, and Brains him with a
<i>Tamahauke</i>, or Club; which done, his Friends bury him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of their Marriages.</div>

<p class='c010'>Now to speak something of their Marriages, the Kings and the <i>Powwows</i>, or great
Doctors, may have two or three Wives, but seldom use it, Men of ordinary Rank
having but one; which disproves the report, that they had eight or ten Wives
apiece. When a Man hath a desire to Marry, he first gets the good will of the
Maid or Widow, after, the consent of her Friends for her part; and for himself, if
he be at his own disposing, and if the King will, the Match is made, her Dowry of
<i>Wampompeage</i> paid, the <i>Sagamore</i> or King (who for every Marriage hath a Fathom of
<i>Wampompeage</i>, which is about the value of seven or eight shillings) joyns their Hands,
never to part till Death, unless she prove a Whore, for which they may put away
their Wives.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of their Worship, Invocations, and Conjurations.</div>

<p class='c010'>As it is natural to all Mortals to worship something, so do these People, but exactly
to describe to whom their Worship is chiefly bent, is very difficult: They
acknowledge especially two, <i>Ketan</i>, some say <i>Tantum</i>, their good God, and <i>Hobamocco</i>,
some say <i>Squantum</i>, their evil God; to <i>Ketan</i> they Sacrifice (as the ancient
<i>Heathens</i> did to <i>Ceres</i>) after their Garners be full with a good Crop. They likewise
Invocate this God for fair Weather, for Rain in time of Drought, and for the
recovery of their Sick; but if they do not hear them, then they verrifie the old
Verse, <i>Flectere si nequeo Superos Acheronta movebo</i>, their <i>Powwows</i> betaking themselves
to their Exorcismes and Necromantick Charms, by which they bring to pass
strange things, if we may believe the <i>Indians</i>, who report of one <i>Pissacannaw</i>, that he
could make the Water burn, the Rocks move, the Trees dance, and metamorphose
himself into a flaming Man. In Winter, when there is no green Leaves to be got,
he would out of the Ashes of an old Leaf, calcin’d and put into the Water, produce
a new green Leaf: And of a dead Snakes Skin, a living Snake, both to be
seen, felt and heard. The manner of their action in their Conjuration is thus:
The Parties that are sick or lame being brought before them, the <i>Powwow</i> sitting
down, the rest of the Indians giving attentive audience to his Imprecations and Invocations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>and after the violent expression of many a hideous bellowing and groaning
he makes a stop, and then all the Auditors with one voice utter a short <i>Canto</i>;
which done, the <i>Powwow</i> still proceeds in his Invocations, sometimes roaring like
a Bear, other times groaning like a dying Horse, foaming at the Mouth like a chased
Boar, smiting on his naked Brest and Thighs with such violence, as if he were
mad: Thus will he continue sometimes half a day, spending his Lungs, sweating
out his Fat, and tormenting his Body in this diabolical Worship. Sometimes the
Devil, for requital of their Worship, recovers the Party, to nuzzle them up in
their devillish Religion. But since the <i>English</i> (upon whom, and in whose presence
it is said the <i>Powwows</i> could never work their Witchcrafts) frequented those Parts,
they daily fall from his Colours, relinquishing their former Fopperies, and acknowledge
the Power of the <i>English</i>-man’s God, as they call him. And it is reported
of them, that at the very first they were so tractable to the <i>Christian</i> Religion, that
they would say King <i>James</i> was good, and his God good, but their <i>Tanto</i> nought,
though of their two Gods he was accounted the good one.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of their Wars.</div>

<p class='c010'>They use no other Weapons in War than Bowes and Arrows, saving that their
Captains have long Spears, on which, if they return Conquerors, they carry the
Heads of their chief Enemies that they slay in the Wars, it being the Custom to
cut off their Heads, Hands and Feet, to bear home to their Wives and Children, as
true tokens of their renowned Victory. When they go to their Wars, it is their
Custom to paint their Faces with diversity of Colours, some being all black as Jet,
some red, some half red and half black, some black and white, others spotted with
divers kinds of Colours, being all disguis’d to their Enemies, to make them more
terrible to their Foes, putting on likewise their rich Jewels, Pendents, and <i>Wampompeage</i>,
to put them in mind that they Fight not onely for their Children, Wives and
Lives, but likewise for their Goods, Lands and Liberties. Being thus Arm’d with
this Warlike Paint, the antique Warriors make towards their Enemies in a disorder’d
manner, without any Soldier-like Marching, or Warlike Postures, being deaf
to any word of Command, ignorant of falling off or on, of doubling Ranks or
Files, but let flie their winged Shaftsmen without either fear or wit: Their Artillery
being spent, he that hath no Arms to Fight, finds Legs to run away.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Games and Sports of Activity.</div>

<p class='c010'>They have two sorts of Games, one call’d <i>Puim</i>, the other <i>Hubbub</i>, not much unlike
Cards and Dice, being no other than Lottery. <i>Puim</i> is fifty or sixty small Bents
of a Foot long, which they divide to the number of their Gamesters, shuffling them
first between the Palms of their Hands; he that hath more than his Fellow, is so
much the forwarder in his Game: Many other Whimsies be in this Game, which
would be too long to commit to Paper. He that is a noted Gamester hath a Hole
in his Ear, wherein he carries his <i>Puims</i> in defiance of his Antagonists. <i>Hubbub</i> is
five small Bones in a small smooth Tray; the Bones be like a Die, but something
flatter, black on the one side and white on the other, which they place on the
Ground, against which violently thumping the Platter, the Bones mount, changing
colours with the windy whisking of their Hands to and fro; which action in that
sport they much use, smiting themselves on the Breast and Thighs, crying out
<i>Hub, Hub, Hub</i>; they may be heard play at this Game a quarter of a Mile off:
The Bones being all black or white make a double Game; if three of one colour,
and two of another, then they afford but a single Game; four of a colour, and one
differing, is nothing; so long as the Man wins he keeps the Tray, but if he loose
the next Man takes it. They are so bewitch’d with these two Games, that they
will lose sometimes all they have; Beaver, <i>Moose</i>-skins, Kettles, <i>Wampompeage</i>, <i>Mowhacks</i>,
Hatchets, Knives, all is confiscate by these two Games. For their Sports of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>action they have commonly but three or four, as Football, Shooting, Running, and
Swimming; when they play Countrey against Countrey, there are rich Goals, all
behung with <i>Wampompeage</i>, <i>Mowhacks</i>, Beaver Skins, and black Otter Skins: Their
Goals are a Mile long plac’d on the Sands, which are as even as a Board; their Ball
is no bigger than a Hand-ball, which sometimes they mount in the Air with their
naked Feet, sometimes it is sway’d by the multitude, sometime also it is two days
before they get a Goal, then they mark the Ground they win, and begin there the
next day. Before they come to this Sport they paint themselves, even as when
they go to War, in policy to prevent future mischief, because no man should know
him that mov’d his patience, or accidentally hurt his Person, taking away the occasion
of studying revenge. Before they begin, their Arms are put off, and hung
upon some neighboring Tree, after which they make a long scrowl on the Sand,
over which they shake Hands, and with loving Hearts scuffle for Victory. While
the Men Play, the Boys Pipe, and the Women Dance and Sing Trophies of their
Husbands Conquests; all being done, a Feast summons their departure.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such is their dexterity in Shooting, that they can hit a running Hind, or flying
Pigeon, without a standing pause or left-ey’d blinking; they draw their Arrows
between their Fingers and the Thumb, their Bowes are quick, but not very strong,
not killing at above six or seven score distance: Shooting at one another, they have
a trick with swift conveyance to shun the Arrow; this they do to make them
expert against time of War. They are train’d up to their Bowes even from their
Childhood; for little Boys with Bowes made of little Sticks, and Arrows made
of great Bents; will hit down a piece of Tobacco-pipe every time a good way
off. As these <i>Indians</i> are good Marks-men, so are they well experienc’d where the
very Life of every Creature lieth, and know where to smite him to make him die
presently. Their Swimming is not after our <i>English</i> fashion, of spread Arms and
Legs, which they hold too tiresom, but like Dogs, their Arms before them, cutting
through the Liquids with their right Shoulder: In this manner they will
Swim very swift and far, either in rough or smooth Waters, sometimes for their
ease lying as still as a Log; sometimes they will play the Dive-doppers, and come
up in unexpected places.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of their Huntings.</div>

<p class='c010'>For their Hunting, it is to be noted, that they have no swift-footed Greyhounds
to let slip at the sight of the Deer, no deep-mouth’d Hounds, or scenting Beagles,
to find out their desired Prey; themselves are all this, who in that time of the year
when the Deer comes down, having certain Hunting-houses in such places where
they know the Deer doth usually frequent, in which they keep their Rendezvouz,
their Snares, and all their Accoutrements for that Employment: when they get
sight of a Deer, <i>Moose</i>, or Bear, they study how to get the Wind of him, and approaching
within shot, stab their Mark quite through, if the Bones hinder
not. The chief thing they Hunt after is Deer, <i>Mooses</i> and Bears: It grieves them
more to see an <i>English</i>-man take one Deer, than a thousand Acres of Land. They
Hunt likewise after Wolves, wild Cats, <i>Rackoons</i>, Otters, Beavers, and <i>Musquashes</i>,
Trading both their Skins and Flesh to the <i>English</i>. Beside this Artillery they have
other devices to kill their Game, as sometimes Hedges, a Mile or two Miles long,
being a Mile wide at one end, and made narrower and narrower by degrees, leaving
onely a Gap of six Foot long; over against which in the day-time they lie
lurking, to shoot the Deer which come through that narrow passage; so many as
come within the circumference of that Hedge, seldom return back to leap over,
unless they be forc’d by the chasing of some ravenous Wolf, or sight of some accidental
Passenger: In the Night, at the Gap of this Hedge, they set Deer-traps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>which are Springes made of young Trees, and smooth wrought Cords, so strong,
that it will toss a Horse if he be caught in it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of their Fishings.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the Trade of Fishing they are very expert, being experienc’d in the knowledge
of all Baits for several Fishes, and divers Seasons; being not ignorant likewise
of the removal of Fishes, knowing when to Fish in Rivers, and when at Rocks,
when in Bays, and when at Seas: Since the <i>English</i> came they are furnish’d with
<i>English</i> Hooks and Lines, for before they made them of Hemp, being more curiously
wrought, of stronger Materials than ours, and hook’d with Bone-Hooks; but
laziness drives them to buy, more than profit or commendations wins them to
make of their own. They make likewise very strong Sturgeon-nets, with which
they catch Sturgeons of twelve, fourteen, and sixteen, and some eighteen Foot long
in the day-time, and in the night-time they betake themselves to their Birchen
<i>Canoos</i>, in which they carry a forty-fathom Line, with a sharp-bearded Dart fastned
at the end thereof; then lighting a Torch made of Birchen Rinds, they wave it
to and again by their <i>Canoo</i> side, which the Sturgeon much delighted with, comes to
them tumbling and playing, turning up his white Belly, into which they thrust their
Lance, his Back being impenetrable; which done, they hale to the Shore their
strugling Prize. They have often recourse into the Rocks whereupon the Sea beats,
in warm Weather, to look out for sleepy Seals, whose Oyl they much esteem, using
it for divers things. In Summer they Fish any where, but in Winter in the fresh
Water onely, and Ponds; in frosty Weather they cut round Holes in the Ice, about
which they will sit like so many Apes with their naked Breeches upon the cold Ice,
catching of Pikes, Pearches, Breams, and other sorts of fresh-Water Fish.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of their Arts and Manufactures.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Arts and Manufactures are divers, as first their dressing of all manner
of Skins, which they do by scraping and rubbing, afterwards painting them
with antique Embroiderings in unchangeable Colours; sometimes they take
off the Hair, especially if it be not kill’d in season. Their Bowes they make of a
handsom shape, strung commonly with the Sinews of <i>Mooses</i>; their Arrows of
young Elder, feather’d with Feathers of Eagles Wings and Tails, headed with
Brass in shape of a Heart or Triangle, fastned in a slender piece of Wood six or
eight Inches long, which is fram’d to put loose in the pithy Elder, afterwards
bound fast for riving: Their Arrows are made in this manner, because it might
shake from his Head, and be left behind for their finding, and the Pile onely remain
to gaul the wounded Beast. Their Cordage is so even, soft, and smooth, that
it looks more like Silk than Hemp. Their Sturgeon Nets are not deep, nor above
thirty or forty Foot long, which in ebbing low Waters they stake fast to the
Ground where they are sure the Sturgeon will come, never looking more at it till
the next low Water. Their <i>Canoos</i> are made either of Pine-trees, which before they
were acquainted with <i>English</i> Tools, they burn’d hollow, scraping them smooth
with Clam-shells and Oyster-shells, cutting their out-sides with Stone Hatchets.
These Boats are not above a Foot and a half, or two Foot wide, and twenty Foot
long. Their other <i>Canoos</i> be made of thin Birch Rinds, close Ribb’d, and on the
in-side with broad thin Hoops, like the Hoops of a Tub; these are made very
light, a Man may carry one of them a Mile, being made purposely to carry from
River to River, and from Bay to Bay, to shorten Land-passages. In these cockling
Fly-boats, wherein an <i>English</i>-man can scarce sit without a fearful tottering, they
will venture to Sea, when an <i>English</i> Shallop dare not bear a Knot of Sail, scudding
over the over-grown Waves as fast as a wind-driven Ship, being driven by their
Paddles, being much like Battle-doors; if a cross Wave (which is seldom) turn her
Keel up-side down, they by swimming free her, and scramble into her again.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of their Language.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Their Language, is onely peculiar to themselves, not inclining to any of the
more refined Tongues. Some have thought they might be of the dispersed <i>Jews</i>,
because some of their words are near unto the <i>Hebrew</i>; but by the same rule they
may conclude them to be some of the gleanings of all Nations, because they have
words which sound after the <i>Greek</i>, <i>Latine</i>, <i>French</i>, and other Tongues. Their Language
is hard to learn, few of the <i>English</i> being able to speak any of it, or capable
of the right pronunciation, which is the chief grace of their Tongue: They pronounce
much after the Diphthongs, excluding <i>L</i> and <i>R</i> which in our <i>English</i>
Tongue they pronounce with as much difficulty, as most of the <i>Dutch</i> do <i>T</i> and <i>H</i>,
calling a Lobster a <i>Nobstann</i>. Every Countrey doth something differ in their Speech,
even as our Northern People do from the Southern, and Western from them; especially
the <i>Tarrentine</i>, whose Tongue runs so much upon <i>R</i> that they wharle much
in pronunciation. When any Ships come near the Shore, they demand whether
they are King <i>Charles’s Torries</i>, with such a rumbling sound, as if one were beating on
an unbrac’d Drum. In serious Discourse our Southern <i>Indians</i> use seldom any short
Colloquies, but speak their minds at large, without any interjected Discourses
from any, the rest giving diligent audience to his utterance; which done, some or
other returns him as long an Answer: They love not to speak <i>multa, sed multum</i>;
seldom are their words and their deeds strangers. According to the matter of their
discourse, so are their acting Gestures in their Expressions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of their Deaths, Burials and Mourning.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Indians</i> are of lusty and healthful Bodies, not experimentally knowing those
Diseases which are incident to other Countreys, as Feavers, Pleurisies, Calentures,
Agues, Consumptions, Convulsions, Apoplexies, Dropsies, Gouts, Pox, Measles,
or the like, but spin out the thred of their Days to a fair length, numbering sixty,
eighty, some a hundred years: But when any one lies a dying, the doleful cries,
and throbbing sighs of the Friends and Relations, express unspeakable sorrow;
and when the Party is dead and laid in the Ground, they not onely weep and howl
for a good space over the Grave, but also keep Annual Solemnities of Mourning,
rubbing their Faces with black Lead all about the Eye-brows, and part of their
Cheeks; yet do they hold the Immortality of the Soul, in which their <i>Indian</i> Faith
jumps much with the <i>Turkish Alchoran</i>, dreaming of a certain Paradise, or South-West
<i>Elysium</i>, wherein they shall everlastingly abide, solacing themselves in odoriferous
Gardens, fruitful Corn-fields, green Meadows, bathing their tawny Hides in
the cool Streams of pleasant Rivers, and sheltering themselves from Heat and Cold
in the sumptuous Palaces fram’d by Nature, concluding, that neither care nor pain
shall molest them, but that Natures bounty will administer all things with a voluntary
contribution from the Store-house of their <i>Elysium</i>; at the Portal whereof,
they say, lies a great Dog, whose churlish snarlings deny admission to unworthy
Intruders: wherefore it is their custom to bury with them their Bowes and Arrows,
and good store of their <i>Wampompeage</i> and <i>Mowhacks</i>, the one to affright that affronting
<i>Cerberus</i>, the other to purchase more immense Prerogatives in their Paradise.
For their Enemies and loose Livers, whom they account unworthy of this imaginary
Happiness, they say that they pass to the infernal Dwellings of <i>Abamocho</i>, to
be tortur’d according to the Fictions of the ancient <i>Heathen</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Dispositions, Employments, Usage by their Husbands, Apparel, and Modesty of the Women.</div>

<p class='c010'>The drudgery of all laborious sorts of Work, and the management of all domestick
Affairs, lies wholly upon the <i>Indian</i> Women, who are made meer Slaves by
their Husbands; they build the Houses, sowe and reap the Corn, provide Lobsters
for their Husbands to bait their Hooks when they go a Fishing for <i>Basse</i> or Cod;
and for these Lobsters they are many times forc’d to dive in the extreamest Weather,
then lug home a great weight of them upon their Backs, as also all the Fish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>which their Husbands catch for pleasure, from the places where they were caught:
They dress all the Meat, serve it up to their Husbands, and waiting till they have
fill’d their Bellies, are glad of their leavings. In Summer they gather Flags, of
which they make Mats for Houses, and Hemp and Rushes, with Dying Stuff, of
which they make curious Baskets, with intermixed Colours and Pourtraictures of
antique Imagery. These Baskets are of all sizes from a Quart to a Quarter, in
which they carry their Luggage. In Winter they are their Husbands Caterers,
trudging to the Clam-banks for their Belly-timber, and their Porters to lug it
home. They likewise sew their Husbands Shoes, and weave Coats of <i>Turky</i> Feathers,
besides all their ordinary Houshold drudgery which daily lies upon them,
insomuch that a great Belly hinders no business, nor doth a Child-birth take much
time, but the young Infant being greas’d and footed, wrapp’d in a Beavers Skin,
bound with his Feet up to his Bum, upon a Board two Foot long and one Foot broad,
and his Face expos’d to all nipping Weather, this little <i>Pappouse</i> travels about with his
bare-footed Mother to paddle in the Icy Clam-banks, after three or four days of
Age have confirm’d her recovery. For their Carriage, it is very civil, Smiles being
the greatest grace of their Mirth. Their Musick is Lullabies in Rocking their Children,
who generally are as quiet as if they had neither Spleen or Lungs. Their
Voices are generally both sweet and well order’d, so far as pure Nature teacheth
them. Their Modesty drives them to wear more Clothes than the Men, having always
a Coat of Cloth or Skins, wrapp’d like a Blanket about their Loyns, reaching
down to their Hams, which they never put off in Company.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns built by the <i>English</i> in <i>New England</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>There are to be reckon’d up forty five chief Towns, besides what others there
may be of less note, built or made habitable by the <i>English</i> since their first arrival
in <i>New England</i>, till about the Year 1650.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>St. Georges Fort.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>First, <i>St. Georges Fort</i>, where the first Plantation was setled, at the Mouth of the
River <i>Sagadebock</i>, in a kind of <i>Peninsula</i>, or half Island.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>New Plymouth.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The second, <i>New Plymouth</i>, seated no less commodiously upon a large Bay, call’d
by the Natives <i>Pautuxed</i>; where they first setled that went over out of dissatisfaction
to the Church-Government of <i>England</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Salem.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The third, <i>Salem</i>, call’d by the <i>Indians</i>, <i>Mahumbeak</i>; which stands on the middle
of a Neck of Land very pleasantly, having a South River on the one side, and a
North River on the other side. This Town seems to have been built in the Year
1628. by a part of that Company, who, being sent over by the <i>Merchant-Adventurers</i>,
setled themselves in this Cape.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Charles-town.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The fourth <i>Mashawmut</i>, or <i>Charles-town</i>, situate on a Neck of Land on the Northside
of the River <i>Charles</i>. The form of this Town, in the Frontispiece of it, resembleth
the Head, Neck, and Shoulders of a Man; through the right Shoulder
whereof runs the Navigable River <i>Mistick</i>, which by its near approach to <i>Charles</i>
River in one place, makes the chief part of the Town a <i>Peninsula</i>: It consists of
a hundred and fifty Dwelling-houses, many of them beautifi’d with pleasant Gardens
and Orchards: Near the Water-side is a large Market-place, forth of which
issue two fair Streets; and in it stands a large and well built Church.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Dorchester.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The fifth, <i>Matapan</i>, or <i>Dorchester</i>, a Fronteer Town, standing over against the
Island near the Sea-side: It is water’d with two small Rivers, and is built in the
form of a Serpent turning its Head Northward; it hath Orchards and Gardens
full of Fruit-trees.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Boston.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The sixth is <i>Boston</i>, anciently <i>Accomonticus</i>, the Center and Metropolis of the rest,
built in the form of a Heart, and fortifi’d with two Hills on the Front-part
thereof, the one having great store of Artillery mounted thereon, the other having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>a strong Battery, built of whole Timber, and fill’d with Earth: At the Descent
of the Hill lies a large Cave or Bay, on which the chief part of this Town is built,
over-topp’d with a third Hill, all three like over-topping Towers, keeping a constant
Watch to foresee the approach of foreign Dangers. The chiefest part of this
City-like Town is crowded upon the Sea Banks, and wharf’d out with great Industry
and Cost, the Edifices large and beautiful, whose continual enlargement presageth
some sumptuous City.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Roxbury.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The seventh, <i>Roxbury</i>, situated between <i>Boston</i> and <i>Dorchester</i>, water’d with cool
and pleasant Springs issuing from the Rocky Hills, and with small Freshets watering
the Valleys of this fertile Town: The form of it resembleth a Wedge double
pointed, entring between the two above-mention’d Towns; and in the room of
those Swamps, or tearing Bushes which were there before, they have now goodly
Fruit-trees, fruitful Fields and Gardens.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lynne.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The eighth is <i>Lynne</i>, or (according to the <i>Indian</i> Name, <i>Saugus</i>) situated between
<i>Salem</i> and <i>Charles-town</i>, near a River, whose strong Freshet at the end of Winter fills
all her Banks, and with a violent Torrent vents it self into the Sea. This Town is
almost square, consisting many years ago of above a hundred Dwelling-houses, having
also an Iron Mill in constant use. The Church being on a level Land, undefended
from the North-West Wind, is made with Steps descending into the Earth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Water-town.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The ninth is call’d <i>Water-town</i>, anciently <i>Pigsgusset</i>, situated upon one of the
Branches of <i>Charles</i>-River, water’d with many pleasant Springs and small Rivulets,
running like Veins throughout her Body. This Town began by occasion of Sir
<i>Richard Saltingstall</i>, who arriving with store of Cattel and Servants, Winter’d in
these Parts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>New-town.</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Harverd Colledge.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1633. there was erected between <i>Charles-town</i> and <i>Water-town</i>, a Place
call’d <i>New-town</i>, and by the <i>Indians</i>, <i>Amongcangen</i>, since nam’d <i>Cambridge</i>, being the
tenth in order: It is in form like a List of Broad-cloth, reaching to the most Southerly
part of <i>Merrimeck</i> River; it hath comely and well order’d Streets, and two
fair Colledges; the first call’d <i>Harverd Colledge</i>, from Mr. <i>John Harverd</i>, who at his
Death gave a thousand Pounds to it; to the other Mr. <i>John Harnes</i> was the chief Benefactor.
This Town was appointed to be the Seat of the Government, but it
continu’d not long.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Ipswich.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The eleventh call’d <i>Ipswich</i>, or <i>Sawacatuc</i> by the <i>Indians</i>, is situated on a fair and
delightful River, issuing forth from a very pleasant Pond, and afterwards breaking
its Course through a hideous Swamp of large extent; it lies in the <i>Sagamoreship</i>, or
Earldom of <i>Aggawan</i>, now by the <i>English</i> call’d <i>Essex</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Newbury.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Twelve Miles from <i>Ipswich</i>, near upon the Streams of <i>Merrimeck</i> River, is situated
the twelfth, call’d <i>Newbury</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Hartford.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The People of <i>New-town</i>, or <i>Cambridge</i>, upon their removal of the Plantation of
<i>Canectico</i>, passing up the River, built a Town, which they call’d <i>Hartford</i>, the thirteenth
in number, divers others coming in the room of those that departed from
<i>Cambridge</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Concord.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The fourteenth, seated upon a fair fresh River (whose Rivulets are fill’d with fresh
Marsh, and her Streams with Fish, it being a Branch of that large River of <i>Merrimeck
Allwives</i>) is built in the Inland Countrey, and call’d <i>Concord</i>: It consisted at
first of above fifty Families: Their Buildings are for the most part conveniently
plac’d on one streight Stream under a Sunny Bank, in a low Level. The People
that first set forth to build this Town, sustain’d great hardship and misery, by reason
of the uncouth Ways, and extremity of the Weather, it being the first Inland
Town that was built.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Hingham.</i></div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>South-East of <i>Charles</i>-River, upon the Sea-Coast, is situated the fifteenth Town
<i>Hingham</i>; the form whereof is somewhat intricate to describe, by reason of the Seawasting
Crooks, where it beats upon a moultring Shore; yet in some places the
Streets are compleat: It consisted at first of about sixty Families.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Dukesbury</i>, or <i>Sandwich</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The sixteenth is in <i>Plymouth</i> Government, situate upon the Sea-Coast, first nam’d
<i>Dukes-bury</i>, afterwards <i>Sandwich</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Newhaven.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>About the year 1617. a new Supply coming over into these Parts, and not finding
in the <i>Mattachusets</i> Government any commodious place to settle in, they after
much search took up a place somewhat more Southerly, near the <i>Shalles</i> of <i>Capecod</i>,
where they found a commodious Harbor for Shipping, and a fit place to erect a
Town in, which they built in a short time, with very fair Houses and compleat
Streets; and shortly after several others: Amongst which they erected a new
Government, which from their first Fronteer Town, being the seventeenth, was
call’d <i>Newhaven</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Dedham.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The eighteenth is in the Government of the <i>Mattachusets</i>, and call’d <i>Dedham</i>, being
an Inland Town, situate about ten Miles from <i>Boston</i> in the County of <i>Suffolk</i>, well
water’d with many pleasant Streams, and abounding with Gardens and Fruit-Trees:
It consisted at first of about a hundred Families, being generally given to
Husbandry.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Weymouth.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The nineteenth being also in this Government is call’d <i>Weymouth</i>, batter’d on the
East with the Sea Waves; on the South-West Rocks and Swamps make it delightful
to the Deer, as the ploughable Meadow-Lands to the Inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the Year 1638. <i>Printing</i> was brought over into <i>New England</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Rowly.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>About six Miles from <i>Ipswich</i>, North-Eastward, was erected another Town
call’d <i>Rowly</i>, being the twentieth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Hampton.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>About the Year 1639. began the one and twentieth Town <i>Hampton</i>, in the
County of <i>Norfolk</i>, to be built: It is situate near the Sea-Coast, not far from the
River of <i>Merrimeck</i>: The great store of salt Marsh did entice the People to set
down their Habitations there.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Salisbury.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Not far from this Town of <i>Hampton</i>, was erected the two and twentieth, call’d
<i>Salisbury</i>, seated upon the broad swift Torrent of <i>Merrimeck</i>-River: It lieth on the
Northern side, over against the Town of <i>Newbury</i>, the River between them being
about half a Mile broad, but hath an Island in the midst thereof, which makes it
the more easily passable. The situation of this Town is very pleasant, the Skirts
thereof abounding in fair and goodly Meadows, with good store of stately Timber
in many places upon the Uplands.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Long-Island, Southampton.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>About the Year 1640. by a fresh Supply of People that setled in <i>Long-Island</i>, was
there erected the twenty third Town, call’d <i>Southampton</i>; by the Indians, <i>Agawom</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sudbury.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The same Year also the Town of <i>Sudbury</i>, being the twenty fourth, began to be
built in the Inland Countrey: It is furnish’d with great store of fresh Marsh, but
lying very low, it is much endammag’d with Land-floods.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Braintree.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>About this time there was built at Mount <i>Wollestone</i>, by some old Planters and
certain Farmers of the great Town of <i>Boston</i>, a Town nam’d <i>Braintree</i>, being the
twenty fifth, within the <i>Mattachusets</i> Government: It is well peopled, and hath
great store of Land in Tillage.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Gloucester.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1641. Mr. <i>Richard Blindman</i> coming from <i>Green Harbour</i>, a Place in
<i>Plymouth</i> Patent, with some few People of his acquaintance, setled in <i>Cape Anne</i>,
where they built the twenty sixth Town, and nam’d it <i>Gloucester</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Dover.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>There is also situate upon <i>Puscataque</i> River, to the North-East of <i>Boston</i>, a Town
call’d <i>Dover</i>, being the twenty seventh, the People by voluntary resignation being
under the <i>Mattachusets</i> Government.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Wooburn.</i></div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>In the Year 1642. was erected the eight and twentieth Town, call’d <i>Wooburn</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Reading.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1644. <i>Reading</i> the nine and twentieth Town was built, being in the
Government of the <i>Mattachusets</i>; it is well water’d and situated about a great
Pond, having two Mills, a Saw-Mill, and a Corn-Mill, which stand upon two
several Streams.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Wenham.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>A little after was built the thirtieth Town in this Colony, call’d <i>Wenham</i>, situate
between <i>Salem</i> and <i>Ipswich</i>; it is very well water’d, as most Inland Towns are, and
the People live altogether on Husbandry.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Spring-field.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>About the Year 1645. one Mr. <i>Pinchin</i>, having out of desire to improve his
Estate by Trading with the <i>Indians</i>, setled himself in a place very remote from any
of the Towns of the <i>Mattachusets</i> Colony, yet under their Government, and great
store of People still resorting to him, they at last erected a Town upon the River
<i>Canectico</i>, calling it <i>Spring-field</i>, being the one and thirtieth Town; it is very fitly
seated for a Beaver Trade with the <i>Indians</i>, in regard it is situate upon this large
Navigable River, and upon some Rivulets of the same.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Haverhill.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1648. was founded the Town of <i>Haverhill</i>, being the two and thirtieth,
about a Mile or two from the place where the River of <i>Merrimeck</i> receives into
it self the River <i>Shawshin</i>, which is one of her three chief Heads.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Malden.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Not long after, the Town of <i>Malden</i>, being the three and thirtieth Town, was
built by certain People that came out of <i>Charles-Town</i>; these two Towns being sever’d
the one from the other by the large River of <i>Mistick</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rest we shall onely name, as 34. <i>Berwick</i>, alias <i>Chawun</i>. 35 <i>Oxford</i>, alias <i>Sagoquas</i>.
<i>Falmouth</i>, alias <i>Totam</i>. 36. <i>Bristol.</i> 37. <i>Hull</i>, alias <i>Passataquack</i>. 38. <i>Dartmouth</i>,
alias <i>Bohanna</i>. 39. <i>Norwich</i>, alias <i>Segocket</i>. 40. <i>Taunton</i>, alias <i>Cohannet</i>. 41. <i>Greens-Harbour.</i>
42. <i>Yarmouth.</i> 43. <i>Northam</i>, alias <i>Pascataqua</i>. 44. <i>Exeter.</i> 45. <i>Weymouth.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>The chief Rivers of <i>New England</i> are, <i>Pascataway</i>, <i>Sagadahoc</i>, <i>Pemmaquid</i>, <i>Agamentico</i>,
<i>Merrimeck</i>, <i>Tachobacco</i>, <i>Mistick</i>, <i>Narraganset</i>, <i>Mishuwin</i>, <i>Connectacut</i>, <i>Newichwavoch</i>,
<i>Kynebequy</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The present state of the Natives.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Indian</i> Natives are now become so weak in number, and in some measure
reduc’d to a dread of the growth of the <i>English</i>, that of late years they have not
practis’d any thing against them, or at least, not justifi’d them by numbers in
open Hostility, willing rather to purchase their Peace and buy off Injuries committed
by them at the Price of their Lands and Possessions.</p>

<p class='c010'>And although care and expence hath been many years apply’d to the Conversion
of <i>Indians</i> to the Faith, however inclinable they seem’d at first to the imbracing
thereof, not then so well discerning the insincerity of its Professors; yet there are
so few of late who do imbrace it or persevere in it (wanting a good Foundation for
instruction in Moral Honesty, and perhaps the example of it in those that undertake
to instruct them in Religion;) that <i>Christianity</i> to them seems a <i>Chimera</i>, Religion a
design to draw them from the libidinous Pleasures of a lazy Life; however, some
there are who make Profession of <i>Christianity</i>, and some who are educated in the
Schools of <i>New Cambridge</i>, to entitle them to Preach the Gospel in their own Language.</p>

<p class='c010'>One great hindrance to the Propagation of the Faith amongst those <i>Heathens</i>, is
the diversity of their Languages; for it is commonly known, that the Natives
themselves do not understand one another, if their Habitations are but at forty
Miles distance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Church-Government among the <i>English</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Church-Government and Discipline is Congregational and Independent,
yet in some places more rigid than others, for in many Towns there yet remains
some leaven of <i>Presbytery</i>, from which Sects our <i>Independency</i> had its Original; insomuch,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>that one of the most remarkable Opposers of <i>Episcopal Government</i>, Doctor
<i>Bastwick</i> (who, spoil’d so much Paper in railing at the Church Government of

of <i>Boston</i> from their first Principles, and his, generally prevail over them, even
to the denying that liberty to others, which they seem’d only to aim at, did write
a large and vehement <i>Dehortatory Epistle</i> to them from their <i>New Lights</i> or <i>Paths</i>, saying,
<i>That according to their present Tenents, they could not pretend to be, or other than a
Christian Synagogue</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Civil Government and Laws.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Laws and Methods of Government are wholly of their own framing,
each Colony for themselves, makes an Annual choice of Governor, Deputy Governor,
and a certain number of Assistants, by the plurality of Suffrages collected
from their several Towns, the Electors are only Free-men and Church-Members;
for he that is not a Member of their Church, can neither chuse, nor be chosen a
Magistrate, nor have his Children Baptiz’d; besides the loss of many other Priviledges,
and liable moreover to frequent, if not constant Mulcts for absenting themselves
from <i>Divine Worship</i> (so call’d) in their Meeting-houses.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since the transmitting of the Patent in <i>New England</i>, the Election is not by Voices,
nor erection of Hands as formerly, but by Papers, thus:</p>

<p class='c010'>The general Court-electory sitting, where are present in the Church, or Meeting-house
at <i>Boston</i>, the old Governor, Deputy, and all the Magistrates, and two
Deputies or Burgesses for every Town, or at least one; all the Freemen are bid
to come in at one Door, and bring their Votes in Paper for the new Governor,
and deliver them down upon the Table, before the Court, and so pass forth at
another Door; those that are absent, send their Votes by Proxies. All being deliver’d
in, the Votes are counted, and according to the major part, the old Governor
pronounceth, <i>That such an one is chosen Governor for the year ensuing</i>. Then the
Freemen, in like manner, bring their Votes for the Deputy Governor, who being
also chosen, the Governor propoundeth the Assistants one after another. New
Assistants are, of late, put in nomination, by an Order of general Court, beforehand
to be consider’d of: If a Freeman give in a Blank, that rejects the Man
nam’d; if the Freeman makes any mark with a Pen upon the Paper which he
brings, that elects the Man nam’d: Then the Blanks and mark’d Papers are number’d,
and according to the major part of either, the Man in Nomination stands
elected or rejected; and so for all the Assistants. And after every new Election,
which is, by their Patent, to be upon the last Wednesday in <i>Easter</i> Term, the new
Governor and Officers are all new Sworn. The Governor and Assistants chuse the
Secretary. And all the Court consisting of Governor, Deputy, Assistants, and Deputies
of Towns, give their Votes as well as the rest; and the Ministers and Elders,
and all Church-Officers, have their Votes also in all these Elections of chief
Magistrates: Constables, and all other inferior Officers, are sworn in the general,
quarter, or other Courts, or before any Assistant.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every Free-man when he is admitted, takes a strict Oath, to be true to the Society
or Jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are two general Courts, one every half year, wherein they make Laws or
Ordinances: The Ministers advise in making of Laws, especially Ecclesiastical, and
are present in Courts, and advise in some special Causes Criminal, and in framing
of Fundamental Laws.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are besides four Quarter-Courts for the whole Jurisdiction, besides other
petty Courts, one every quarter at <i>Boston</i>, <i>Salem</i>, and <i>Ipswich</i>, with their several Jurisdictions;
besides every Town, almost, hath a petty Court for small Debts and
Trespasses, under twenty Shillings.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Actions and Causes.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>In the general Court, or great quarter Courts, before the Civil Magistrates, are
try’d all Actions and Causes Civil and Criminal, and also Ecclesiastical, especially
touching Non-members: And they themselves say, that in the general and quarter
Courts, they have the Power of Parliament, Kings-Bench, Common-Pleas, Chancery,
High-Commission, and Star-Chamber, and all other Courts of <i>England</i>, and
in divers Cases have exercis’d that Power upon the Kings Subjects there, as is not
difficult to prove. They have put to death, banish’d, fin’d Men, cut off Mens
Ears, whip’d, imprison’d Men, and all these for Ecclesiastical and Civil Offences,
and without sufficient Record. In the lesser quarter Courts are try’d, in some, Actions
under ten Pounds, in <i>Boston</i>, under twenty, and all Criminal Causes not touching
Life or Member. From the petty quarter Courts, or other Courts, the parties
may appeal to the great quarter Courts, from thence to the general Court, from
which there is no Repeal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Grand-Juries.</div>

<p class='c010'>Twice a year, in the said quarter Courts held before the general Courts, are two
Grand-Juries sworn for the Jurisdiction, one for one Court, and the other for the
other; and they are charg’d to enquire and Present Offences reduc’d by the Governor
who gives the Charge.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Trials.</div>

<p class='c010'>Matters of Debt, Trespass, and upon the Case, and Equity, yea and of Heresie
also, are try’d by a Jury.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Parties are warn’d to challenge any Jury-man before he be sworn; but because
there is but one Jury in a Court for trial of Causes; and all Parties not present
at their Swearing, the liberty of challenge is much hinder’d, and some inconveniences
do happen thereby. Jurors are return’d by the Marshal, he was at first
call’d <i>The Beadle of the Society</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Parties in all Causes, speak themselves for the most part, and some of the
Magistrates where they think cause requireth, do the part of Advocates without
Fee or Reward.</p>

<p class='c010'>Though among the several Colonies which were founded here by the confluence
of dissenting Zealots, this Government is exercis’d, differing from that of the
Church and State of <i>England</i>: yet in those Provinces which are granted by particular
Persons, the Government is much more conformable to that of <i>England</i>; but
as the <i>Mattachusets</i> or <i>Bostoners</i> were from the beginning the most Potent and Predominant
of all the rest of the Colonies, (insomuch, that <i>Boston</i> may well be accounted
the Metropolis of all <i>New England</i>,) so of late years they have still usurp’d more
and more Power and Authority over the rest; and especially have not stuck to give
Laws to the foresaid Provinces allotted to particular Persons, and have gone about
wholly to subjugate those places to themselves, intrenching upon the rights of the
true Proprietors; and that, even contrary to the Kings express Commands by his
Officers, there, and as it were in open defiance of his Majesty and Government, as
is evident from this following Narration, of their behavior upon a business of this
nature.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Proceedings of the <i>Mattachusets</i> against his Majesties Commissioners.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>In the Year of our Lord 1665. his Majesties Commissioners for the Affairs of
<i>New England</i>, being in the Province of <i>Mayne</i>, the People being much unsetled
in Point or Government, by reason the <i>Mattachusets</i> Colony, or <i>Boston</i> Government,
did usurp compulsively a Power over them contrary to their wills; and the
right of Sir <i>Ferdinando Gorges</i> Heir, who had his Commission then in the place, did
unanimously Petition to his Majesties Commissioners to settle the Government;
upon which the said Commissioners examin’d the Bounds and Right of Mr. <i>Gorges</i>
Patent, with all the Allegations and Pretensions on both sides, and so according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>to their Instruction from his Majesty, did settle a temporary Government under his
Majesty’s immediate Authority, until such time as his Majesty should give his final
determination thereof; and for that end did Institute Justices of the Peace to Govern
the Province according to the true Laws of <i>England</i>. Also his Majesty was
pleas’d by his <i>Mandamus</i> in <i>April 1666</i>, to the Governors of <i>Boston</i>, to signifie that it
was his will and pleasure, That the Province of <i>Main</i> should stand good as his
Commissioners had setled it, until he had more leisure to determine it; yet notwithstanding,
after three years quiet possession, and exercising of Government by
the Kings Justices, according to their Commission granted by his Majesty’s Commissioners,
the <i>Bostoners</i>, without any Conference with the said Justices, did in a
hostile manner oppose the King’s Power, <i>July 1668.</i> which was as followeth:</p>

<p class='c010'>The General Court of <i>Boston</i> sent their Warrants to keep Court at <i>York</i> under
their Authority, and for that purpose Commissionated Magistrates by their own
Authority, namely Major General <i>John Leveret</i>, Mr. <i>Edward Ting</i>, Captain <i>Richard
Walden</i>, and Captain <i>Robert Pike</i>: Whereupon the King’s Justices did oppose their
Warrants, and sent Post to <i>New York</i>, with an Address to General <i>Nicholas</i>, for Advice
what to do therein; who forthwith dispatch’d away to the Governors of
<i>Boston</i>, informing them of the danger of their Proceeding, it being an open breach
of Duty, to subvert the Government establish’d by his Majesty’s Power; also sent
the King’s <i>Mandamus</i>, <i>April 1666.</i> that will’d to the contrary. Notwithstanding
the <i>Boston</i> Magistrates in <i>July 1668.</i> in order to their <i>Boston</i> Commission, came to
<i>York</i> Town in the said Province, with several Armed Men, Horse and Foot, to keep
Court under their Authority; Opposition was made by the King’s Justices, and
his Majesty’s Power was urg’d, but little regard thereunto shewn; his Majesties
<i>Mandamus</i> was likewise much insisted upon, and produced by the Justices, who ask’d
the <i>Bostoners</i> what they thought of it? and how they durst act so contrary to the
King’s Will and Pleasure? Major General <i>Leveret</i> told them, That he believ’d it
might be the King’s Hand, but he had a Commission from the general Court at
<i>Boston</i>, which he would follow and observe by the help of God. The same day
in the Afternoon the said Major General <i>Leveret</i>, with the rest of the <i>Boston</i> Magistrates,
seiz’d and imprison’d the Province Marshal in doing his Office, and then
forthwith went in warlike posture to the Court-house, where the King’s Justices
sat in Judicature, and putting them from their Seats, sat down themselves in their
Places, and Executed their <i>Boston</i> Commission. The King’s Justices drew a <i>Protest</i>
against their Proceedings, and so left the Decision to God’s Providence, and his
Majesty’s good Pleasure. Then they turn’d out all Officers, both Military and Civil,
and Swore others in their Places under their Authority; they forc’d the whole
Record of the Province out of the Recorders House contrary to his Will, by
vertue of a Special Warrant from that Court. They imprison’d the Mayor of the
said Province about three weeks, forcing him to give in five hundred Pound Bonds,
not to act according to his Commission; which with some Reservations he was
forc’d to deny for the security of his Estate.</p>

<p class='c010'>These riotous Proceedings thus acted with such a precipitate fury, so incens’d
his Majesty, that speedy care had been taken to reduce them to reason, had they not
upon mature consideration bethought themselves afterwards to yield Obedience to
his Majesties Orders.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having treated at large of all that concerns <i>New England</i> in general, both in reference
to the Natives and the <i>English</i> Planters, we shall conclude with a brief view
of the Provinces of <i>Laconia</i> and <i>Main</i>, as they are truly Describ’d (among other ingenuous
Collections and Observations of the Affairs of <i>America</i>, and especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>these Parts) by <i>Ferdinando Gorges</i> Esq; Heir to the above-mention’d Sir <i>Ferdinando</i>,
and thereby sole Lord of the said Provinces, onely contracting what hath been by
him deliver’d more at large.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A brief Description of <i>Laconia</i>, a Province in <i>New England</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Among divers Plantations of the <i>English</i> happily Founded in <i>New England</i>, is a
Province to the Landward, nam’d <i>Laconia</i>, so call’d by reason of the great Lakes
therein, but by the ancient Inhabitants thereof it is call’d <i>The Countrey of the Troquois</i>:
It lies between the Latitude of forty four and forty five Degrees, having the Rivers
of <i>Sagadehock</i> and <i>Merrimeck</i> on the Sea-Coast of <i>New England</i>, Southerly from
it; into each of which Rivers there is a short Passage, frequented by the Salvages
inhabiting near the Lakes. Also it hath the great Lakes which tend towards <i>California</i>
in the South Sea on the West thereof: On the North thereof is the great
River of <i>Canada</i>, into which the said River disgorgeth it self by a fair large River,
well replenish’d with many fruitful Islands: The Air thereof is pure and wholesom,
the Countrey pleasant, having some high Hills, full of goodly Forrests, and fair
Valleys and Plains, fruitful in Corn, Vines, Chesnuts, Wallnuts, and infinite sorts
of other Fruits, large Rivers well stor’d with Fish, and inviron’d with goodly Meadows
full of Timber-trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the great Lakes is call’d <i>The Lake of Troquois</i>, which together with a River
of the same Name, running into the River of <i>Canada</i>, is sixty or seventy Leagues
in length.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Lake are four fair Islands, which are low and full of goodly Woods and
Meadows, having store of Game for Hunting, as Stags, Fallow-Deer, Elks, Roe-Bucks,
Beavers, and other sorts of Beasts which come from the Main Land to the
said Islands.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Rivers which fall into the Lakes have in them good store of Beavers; of
which Beasts, as also of the Elks, the Salvages make their chiefest Traffick.</p>

<p class='c010'>The said Islands have been inhabited heretofore by the Salvages, but are now
abandon’d by reason of their late Wars one with another: They contain twelve
or fifteen Leagues in length, and are seated commodiously for Habitation in the
midst of the Lake, which abounds with divers kinds of wholesom Fish.</p>

<p class='c010'>From this Lake run two Rivers Southward, which fall into the Eastern and
Southern Sea-Coast of <i>New England</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Into this Lake there went many years since certain <i>French</i> of <i>Quebeck</i>, who sided
with the <i>Algovinquins</i>, with the help of their <i>Canoos</i>, which they carried the space of
five Miles over the <i>Impossible Falls</i>, to Fight a Battel in revenge of some former Injuries
done by the <i>Troquois</i> to the <i>Algovinquins</i>, who had the Victory; for which cause
the <i>French</i> have been so hated ever since by the Nation of the <i>Troquois</i>, that none of
them durst ever appear in any part of that Lake. But their Trade, said to be sixteen
thousand Beavers yearly, is partly sold to the <i>Dutch</i>, who Trade with the Westend
of the said Lake over Land by Horses, from their Plantation upon <i>Hudson</i>’s
<i>River</i>: and another part is conceiv’d to be purchas’d by the <i>Hiroons</i>, who being
Newters, are Friends both to the one and the other; and these <i>Hiroons</i> bring down
the greatest part of all by the River of <i>Canada</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Way over Land to this great Lake, from the Plantation of <i>Pascataway</i>, hath
been attempted by Captain <i>Walter Neale</i>, once Governor, at the Charges of Sir <i>Ferdinando
Gorges</i>, Captain <i>Mason</i>, and some Merchants of <i>London</i>, and the Discovery
wanted but one days Journey of finishing, because their Victuals was spent, which,
for want of Horses, they were enforc’d to carry with their Arms, and their Clothes,
upon their Backs: They intended to have made a settlement for Trade by Pinnaces
upon the said Lake, which they reckon to be about ninety or a hundred Miles from
the Plantation over Land.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>The People of the Countrey are given to Hunting of wild Beasts, which is their
chiefest Food.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Arms are Bowes and Arrows. Their Armor is made partly of Wood,
and partly of a kind of twisted Stuff like Cotton-Wool.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Meat is Flour of <i>Indian</i> Corn, of that Countreys growth, sodden to Pap,
which they preserve for times of Necessity when they cannot Hunt.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Province of <i>Laconia</i>, however known by a distinct Name, is included within
the Province of <i>Main</i>, which offers it self next to our consideration.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of the Province of <i>Main</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>All that part of the Continent of <i>New England</i>, which was allotted by Patent to
Sir <i>Ferdinando Gorges</i> and to his Heirs, he thought fit to call by the Name of <i>The Province
of Main</i>. It takes it beginning at the entrance of <i>Pascatoway</i> Harbor, and so
passeth up the same into the River of <i>Newichwavoch</i>; and through the same unto the
farthest Head thereof; and from thence North-Westwards for the space of a hundred
and twenty Miles; and from the Mouth of <i>Pascatoway</i> Harbor aforesaid,
North-Eastward along the Sea-Coast, to <i>Sagadehock</i>; and up the River thereof to
<i>Kinibequy</i> River, even as far as the Head thereof; and into the Land North-Westwards,
for the space of a hundred and twenty Miles.</p>

<p class='c010'>To these Territories are also adjoyn’d the North half of the Isles of <i>Sholes</i>, together
with the Isles of <i>Capawick</i> and <i>Nautican</i>, as also all the little Islands lying within
five Leagues of the <i>Main</i>, all along the Sea-Coast, between the aforesaid Rivers of
<i>Pascatoway</i> and <i>Sagadehock</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>He no sooner had this Province setled upon him, but he gave publick notice,
That if anyone would undertake by himself and his Associates, to Transport a
competent number of Inhabitants, to Plant in any part of his Limits, he would
assign unto him or them such a proportion of Land, as should in reason satisfie them,
reserving onely to himself some small High-Rent, as 2 <i>s.</i> or 2 <i>s.</i> 6 <i>d.</i> for a hundred
Acres <i>per Annum</i>: and if they went about to build any Town or City, he would
Endow them with such Liberties and Immunities, as should make them capable to
Govern themselves within their own Limits, according to the Liberties granted to
any Town or Corporation within this Realm of <i>England</i>. And as for others of the
meaner sort who went as Tenants, that they should have such quantities of Land
assign’d them as they were able to manage, at the Rate of 4 <i>d.</i> or 6 <i>d.</i> an Acre, according
to the nature or situation of the Place they settle in.</p>

<p class='c010'>And for the Division of the Province, and the Form of Government which he
intended to Establish, he first divided the Province into several Parts; and those
again he subdivided into distinct Regiments, as East, West, North, and South;
those again into several Hundreds, Parishes and Tythings, and these to have their
several Officers to Govern, according to such Laws as should be agreed upon by
publick Assent of the Free-holders, with the approbation of himself or Deputy, and
the principal Officers of the publick State.</p>

<p class='c010'>The setled Government for the general State, to whom all Appeals were to be
made, and from whom all Instructions for the welfare of the Publick were to issue,
were to consist of himself or his Deputy, who was to be chosen every three year
by himself, with the advice of his Council: Next a Chancellor for the determination
of all Causes; A Treasurer, to whom the care of the publick Revenue was
to be committed; A Marshal, whose Office was to oversee the Regiments, and to
provide Men for publick Service; An Admiral, to take care of all Maritime Affairs,
to whom a Judge of the Admiralty was to be joyn’d to determine all Maritime
Causes; A Master of the Ordnance, to look to the publick Arms and Ammunition;
A Secretary, to receive Intelligence, and to acquaint himself or Deputy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>therewith. To these belong all their several Officers and Ministers for the Execution
of all Matters proper to their several Places.</p>

<p class='c010'>The chief Town of this Province is call’d <i>Gorgiana</i>, which is Govern’d by a
Mayor, the rest are onely inconsiderable Villages or scatter’d Houses; but through
Encouragement given to Adventurers and Planters, it may prove in time a very
flourishing Place, and be replenish’d with many fair Towns and Cities, it being a
Province both fruitful and pleasant.</p>

<h4 id='c168' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. II.</span><br /> New Netherland, now call’d New York.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>That Tract of Land formerly call’d <i>The New Netherland</i>, doth contain all
that Land which lieth in the North parts of <i>America</i>, betwixt <i>New England</i>
and <i>Mary-Land</i>; the length of which Northward into the Countrey, as it
hath not been fully discover’d, so it is not certainly known: The breadth of it is
about two hundred Miles. The principal Rivers within this Tract, are <i>Hudson</i>’s-River,
<i>Raritan</i>-River, <i>Delaware-Bay</i>-River. The chief Islands are the <i>Manhatans</i>-Island,
<i>Long</i>-Island, and <i>Staten</i>-Island.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first which discover’d this Countrey was <i>Henry Hudson</i>, who being hir’d by
the <i>East-India</i> Company to seek a Passage in the <i>Northern America</i> to <i>China</i>, set Sail
<i>Anno 1609.</i> in the <i>Half-Moon</i> Frigat; coming before <i>Terre-neuff</i>, he stood about towards
the South-West, where Sailing up a great River, he found two Men Clad
in <i>Ruffelo</i>’s Skins; and from thence arriv’d safe at <i>Amsterdam</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>New Netherland</i> thus discover’d, invited many Merchants to settle a firm Plantation
there; to which purpose they obtain’d Letters Patents in 1614. granted
them by the <i>States</i> in the <i>Hague</i>, That they might onely Traffick to <i>New Netherland</i>;
whereupon they earnestly prosecuting the Design, sent out <i>Adrian Block</i> and
<i>Godyn</i>, who discover’d several Coasts, Isles, Havens, and Rivers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey, as they said, being then void, was therefore free for any body
that would take possession of it: Notwithstanding which pretence, they were
scarce warm in their Quarters, when Sir <i>Samuel Argal</i>, Governor of <i>Virginia</i>, having
first spoil’d the <i>French</i> in <i>Accadie</i>, as we said, disputed the Possession with these also.
And although they pleaded <i>Hudson</i>’s Right (who by Commission from King <i>James</i>,
and upon an <i>English</i> Account, had lately discover’d those Parts) and pretended they
had not onely bought all his Cards and Maps of the Countrey, but all his Interest
and Right also, and had fully contented him for all his Pains and Charges in the
Discovery; yet the said <i>Hudson</i> being an <i>English</i>-man, and acting all that he did
by Commission from the King of <i>England</i>, upon Debate it was concluded, That the
Land could not be alienated after Discovery without the King of <i>England</i>’s consent,
especially it being but a part of the Province of <i>Virginia</i>, already possess’d by the
Subjects of <i>England</i>: So that they were forc’d to wave that Title, and the <i>Dutch</i> Governor
submitted his Plantation to His Majesty of <i>England</i>, and to the Governor of
<i>Virginia</i>, for and under him: Upon which Terms for a good while they held it.
Afterwards, upon confidence, it seems, of a new Governor sent from <i>Amsterdam</i>, they
not onely fail’d to pay the promis’d Contribution and Tribute, but fell to fortifie
themselves, and to entitle the Merchants of <i>Amsterdam</i> to an absolute Propriety and
Dominion of the Country, independent of any other; building Towns, as <i>New Amsterdam</i>;
raising Forts, as <i>Orange Fort</i>, near the Branch of the <i>Nordt River</i>, which they
call <i>Hell-Gate</i>. Complaint whereof being made to King <i>Charles</i>, and by his Ambassador
represented to the <i>States</i>, they disown the business, and declare by Publick
Instrument, that it was onely a private Undertaking, <i>viz.</i> of the <i>West-India</i> Company
of <i>Amsterdam</i>. Whereupon a Commission was granted to Sir <i>George Calvert</i>,
made Lord <i>Baltimore</i> in <i>Ireland</i>, to Possess and Plant the Southern parts thereof, lying
towards <i>Virginia</i>, by the name of <i>Mary-land</i>; and to Sir <i>Edmund Loyden</i>, to Plant the
Northern parts towards <i>New England</i>, by the name of <i>Nova Albion</i>: Which makes
the <i>Dutch</i> the second time seem willing to compound; and for the Sum of two
thousand and five hundred Pounds, they offer to be gone, and leave all they had
there. But taking advantage of the troubles in <i>England</i>, which then began to appear,
and soon after follow’d, they not only go back from their first Propositions, and
make higher Demands, but also most mischievously (as some report) furnish
the Natives with Arms, and teach them the use of them, as it may be thought, expecting
to use their help upon occasion, against the <i>English</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>After His Majesties Restauration, His Majesty being truly inform’d of his just
Pretences to all that Usurp’d Territory call’d <i>New Netherland</i>, (the same having
been formerly part of <i>New England</i>) and of how great prejudice to the Act of Navigation,
and how dangerous Intruders the <i>Dutchmen</i> are generally upon other
Princes Dominions, what mischief might ensue to all our <i>English</i> Plantations in
time of War, if the <i>Dutch</i> were permitted to strengthen themselves in the very
heart of His Majesties Dominions, being Masters of one of the most commodious
Ports and Rivers in <i>America</i>: His Majesty resolv’d to seize upon the same, as his
undoubted Right, and in <i>May 1664.</i> having design’d four Commissioners to the
perfecting of Affairs in <i>New England</i>, Collonel <i>Richard Nichols</i>, Sir <i>Robert Carr</i>,
<i>George Cartwright</i>, and <i>Samuel Mawrick</i> Esquires, with three Ships of War to convey
them to <i>Boston</i>: The matter was so order’d, that the same Ships serv’d for the reducing
of the Town and Fort of <i>New Amsterdam</i>, upon conditions, advantageous
to His Majesty, and easie to the <i>Dutch</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now begins <i>New Netherland</i> to lose the Name, for His Majesty having conferr’d
by Patent upon his Royal Highness the Duke of <i>York</i> and <i>Albany</i>, all the Acquisitions
made upon Foraigners, together with <i>Long-Island</i>, the West end whereof
was wholly setled and Peopled by <i>Dutch-men</i>; his Royal Highness impower’d, by
Commission as his Deputy-Governor, Colonel <i>Nichols</i>, Groom of his Bed-chamber,
to take the Charge and Direction of Reducing and Governing all those Territories;
it was by him thought fit, to change some principal denominations of Places,
<i>viz.</i> <i>New Netherland</i> into <i>York-shire</i>; <i>New Amsterdam</i> into <i>New York</i>; <i>Fort-Amscel</i> into <i>Fort-James</i>;
<i>Fort-Orange</i> into <i>Fort-Albany</i>; and withal, to change <i>Burgomasters</i>, <i>Schepen</i>, and
<i>Schout</i>, into Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriff, with Justices of the Peace; so that all
the Civil Policy is conformable to the Methods and Practise of <i>England</i>, whereas
<i>New England</i> retains only the name of <i>Constable</i> in their whole Rolls of Civil Officers.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is plac’d upon the neck of the Island <i>Manhatans</i>, looking towards the Sea; encompass’d
with <i>Hudson</i>’s River, which is six Miles broad; the Town is compact
and oval, with very fair Streets and several good Houses; the rest are built much
after the manner of <i>Holland</i>, to the number of about four hundred Houses, which
in those parts are held considerable: Upon one side of the Town is <i>James-Fort</i>,
capable to lodge three hundred Souldiers and Officers; it hath four Bastions, forty
Pieces of Cannon mounted; the Walls of Stone, lin’d with a thick Rampart of
Earth; well accommodated with a Spring of fresh Water, always furnish’d with
Arms and Ammunition, against Accidents: Distant from the Sea seven Leagues,
it affords a safe Entrance, even to unskilful Pilots; under the Town side, Ships of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>any Burthen may Ride secure against any Storms, the Current of the River being
broken by the interposition of a small Island, which lies a Mile distant from the
Town.</p>

<p class='c010'>About ten Miles from <i>New York</i> is a Place call’d <i>Hell-Gate</i>, which being a narrow
Passage, there runneth a violent Stream both upon Flood and Ebb; and in the
middle lie some Rocky Islands, which the Current sets so violently upon, that
it threatens present Shipwrack; and upon the Flood is a large Whirlwind, which
continually sends forth a hideous roaring, enough to affright any Stranger from
passing farther, and to wait for some <i>Charon</i> to conduct him through; yet to those
that are well acquainted, little or no danger: It is a place of great Defence against
any Enemy coming in that way, which a small Fortification would absolutely
prevent, and necessitate them to come in at the West end of <i>Long-Island</i> by <i>Sandy
Hook</i>, where <i>Nutten Island</i> forces them within the Command of the Fort at <i>New York</i>,
which is one of the best Pieces of Defence in the North parts of <i>America</i>. It is built
most of Brick and Stone, and cover’d with red and black Tyle, and the Land being
high, it gives at a distance a pleasing prospect to the Spectators. The Inhabitants
consist most of <i>English</i> and <i>Dutch</i>, and have a considerable Trade with <i>Indians</i> for
Beaver, Otter, and <i>Rackoon</i>-Skins, with other Furrs; as also for Bear, Deer and
<i>Elke</i>-Skins; and are supply’d with Venison and Fowl in the Winter, and Fish in
the Summer by the <i>Indians</i>, which they buy at an easie Rate; and having the Countrey
round about them, they are continually furnish’d with all such Provisions as
is needful for the Life of Man, not onely by the <i>English</i> and <i>Dutch</i> within their own,
but likewise by the adjacent Colonies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Manhattans</i> River.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Manhattans</i>, or <i>Great River</i>, being the chiefest, having with two wide Mouths
wash’d the mighty Island <i>Watouwaks</i>, falls into the Ocean. The Southern Mouth
is call’d <i>Port May</i>, or <i>Godyns Bay</i>. In the middle thereof lies an Island call’d <i>The
States Island</i>; and a little higher the <i>Manhattans</i>, so call’d from the Natives, which
on the East side of the River dwell on the Main Continent. They are a cruel People,
and Enemies to the <i>Hollanders</i>, as also of the <i>Sanhikans</i>, which reside on the
Western Shore. Farther up are the <i>Makwaes</i> and <i>Mahikans</i>, which continually War
one against another. In like manner all the Inhabitants on the West side of the River
<i>Manhattan</i> are commonly at Enmity with those that possess the Eastern Shore;
who also us’d to be at variance with the <i>Hollanders</i>, when as the other People
Westward kept good Correspondency with them.</p>

<p class='c010'>On a small Island near the Shore of the <i>Makwaes</i>, lay formerly a Fort, provided
with two Drakes and eleven Stone Guns, yet was at last deserted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Wholesom Waters.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey hath many removable Water-falls, descending from steep Rocks,
large Creeks and Harbors, fresh Lakes and Rivulets, pleasant Fountains and
Springs, some of which boyl in the Winter, and are cold and delightful to drink in
Summer. The Inhabitants never receive any damage by Deluges; neither from
the Sea, because the Water rises not above a Foot; nor by the swelling Rivers,
which sometimes, for a few days covering the Plains, at their deserting them,
leave them fat and fruitful. The Sea-Coast is Hilly, and of a sandy and clayie
Soil, which produces abundance of Herbs and Trees.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Trees.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Oak grows there generally sixty or seventy Foot high, and for the most part
free from Knots, which makes it the better fit for Shipping.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Nut-trees afford good Fuel, and a strange Prospect when the Wood is set
on fire, either to hunt out a Deer, or to clear the Ground fit to be Till’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some Plants brought hither, grow better than in <i>Holland</i> it self, as Apples, Pears,
Cherries, Peaches, Apricocks, Strawberries, and the like.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Vines.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Vines grow wild in most places, and bear abundance of blue, white, and
Muskadine Grapes: Sometime since the Inhabitants made a considerable advantage
by the Wine of them, which is not inferior to either <i>Rhenish</i> or <i>French</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Water Lemmons.</div>

<p class='c010'>All manner of Plants known in <i>Europe</i> grow in their Gardens: The Water-Lemmons,
no less pleasing to the Palate than healthful when grown ripe; they are
about the bigness of an indifferent Cabbage: the <i>English</i> press a Juice out of them,
which if it did not turn sowre in a short time, might well be compar’d with <i>Spanish</i>
Wine.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Calabashes</i> which grow there, made hollow, serve for Water-cups.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pumpions are also there in great abundance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Wheat.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Wheat though Set six Foot deep, grows very speedily: Kidney-Beans
being planted amongst it, they will wind about the Stalks thereof.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Pease.</div>

<p class='c010'>Gray Pease grow here so fast, that they gather them twice a year.</p>

<p class='c010'>In one Field Physical Herbs and <i>Indigo</i> grow wild in great abundance; and Barley
springs above a Mans heighth.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, there are divers sorts of sweet-smelling Flowers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Soyl of the Mountains.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Hills are most of a fat and clayie Soil, fit to make Pots, Tobacco-pipes, or
any other sort of Earthen Ware.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gold and Silver-Mines.</div>

<p class='c010'>In some places also is store of Mountain Crystal, and that sort of Mineral which
we call <i>Muscovia Glass</i>: Others afford Marble, Serpentine Stone, and other sorts
of hard Stone. And though the Natives did not think it worth their while, or were
not in a capacity to dig for Minerals themselves, yet it remains without contradiction,
that the Mountains inclose both Gold and Silver.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Captain <i>William Clieff</i>, <i>Anno 1645.</i> us’d the <i>Indian</i> Interpreter <i>Agheroense</i>
(to decide the Differences which arose between the <i>West-India Company</i> and the wild
People call’d <i>Makwaes</i>,) he observ’d him to paint his Face with a yellow glittering
colour, which he judg’d to be of some rich Mineral: whereupon buying some of
the said <i>Agheroense</i>, he put it into a Crusible, and gain’d two small pieces of Gold
out of the same, valu’d at six Shillings; but keeping it private, and purchasing a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>great quantity of the said Mineral from <i>Agheroense</i> (who had show’d him the Mountain
which produced the same) extracted good store of Gold out of it; which possessing
<i>Clieff</i> with a belief of having found out a business of great consequence, he
sent <i>Arent Corsen</i> of <i>New-haven</i> with the fore-mention’d Mineral to <i>Holland</i>; but the
Ship being never heard of afterwards, and the Princess Pink, in which Captain
<i>Clieff</i> was himself, with store of the new-found Mineral, being cast away, the Business
came to nothing.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Paint after a strange manner.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Inhabitants, though divided into several Nations, yet agree in many things,
as in painting their Bodies, Shields, Clubs, and other Utensils in their Houses.
The Colours wherewith they paint themselves they press out of Plants, or
make them of certain Stones grownd into very fine Powder. The chiefest Plant is
not unlike the Myrtle, onely it hath more Boughs, and bears red Berries; the Juice
of which being dry’d in the Sun, is afterwards preserv’d in little Bags. The Natives
temper their Colours with Water, and paint their Bodies with the same: It
is as good a Purple as can be found. They also draw Ships, Trees, and Beasts after
a very rough manner: In stead of Feathers they wear pleited Hair, which being
colour’d red, hath an excellent gloss, which never fades though it Rain on the
same.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Horses.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Horses bred in this Countrey, being either brought thither from <i>England</i>
or <i>Utrecht</i>, far exceed those of <i>English</i> breed; but are both of them subject to a
strange Disease, of which many die in few hours. The same Distemper also seizes
on Cattel if they go into Forrest Pasture: But the onely thing to cure the same, is
Hay from salt Marshy Grounds.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Hogs.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Oaken Woods have store of Hogs, which if taken and fatned with <i>Turkish</i>
Wheat, are most delicious Meat.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sheep.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Sheep, though they breed well there, yet are very scarce, because the Planters
not being able to spare Men to watch them, they are often devour’d by
Wolves.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are also abundance of Deer, all sorts of Fowls, Turkies, Geese, Ducks,
Pigeons, and the like.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Lyons.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Lyons, whose Skins the <i>Indians</i> bring to Market, are taken on a high Mountain
fifteen days Journey South-West from thence.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Black Bears.</div>

<p class='c010'>There are likewise many black Bears, fearful of humane kind, but if Hunted,
they run direct on those that pursue them: they sleep all the Winter, lying six
Weeks on one side, and six on the other, and sucking their Feet all the time: They
generally lurk among Brambles, or in the Concavities of some hollow Mountain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Beasts.</div>

<p class='c010'>On the Borders of <i>Canada</i> there is seen sometimes a kind of Beast which hath
some resemblance with a Horse, having cloven Feet, shaggy Mayn, one Horn just
on their Forehead, a Tail like that of a wild Hog, black Eyes, and a Deers Neck:
it feeds in the nearest Wildernesses: the Males never come amongst the Females
except at the time when they Couple, after which they grow so ravenous, that they
not onely devour other Beasts, but also one another.</p>

<p class='c010'>Towards the South of <i>New York</i> are many Buffles, Beasts which (according to
<i>Erasmus Stella</i>) are betwixt a Horse and a Stag: though they are of a strong Constitution,
yet they die of the smallest Wound, and are subject to the Falling-sickness:
they have broad branchy Horns like a Stag, short Tail, rough Neck, Hair
colour’d according to the several Seasons of the Year, broad and long Ears, hanging
Lips, little Teeth, and Skin so thick, as not easie to be pierced: The Females
differ from the Males, for they have no Horns; both may easily be made tame:
when Hunted, they vomit out a sort of scalding Liquor on the Dogs: they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>great force in their Claws, for they can kill a Wolf with the same at one blow:
their Flesh, either fresh or salted, is a good Diet: their Claws also cure the Falling-sickness.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_191.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Harts.</div>

<p class='c010'>But no Beasts are more plentiful here than Harts and Stags, which feed up and
down in great Herds: when they are Hunted by Wolves or Men, they immediately
take the next River, where they are caught several together, by being cross’d
in their Swimming, and affrighted by the Eccho which comes from the Mountains,
made by the Hunters hollowing on the other Shore, which makes them fearful of
Landing: whilst the Huntsmen joyning several pieces of Wood together get upon
them, and Rowing towards these Deer, intercept them, being tir’d and out of
breath.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Musk-Cats.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, this Countrey breeds many Musk Cats, especially in Marshy
Grounds. These Beasts are beautiful to the Eye, having black speckled Skins,
their Mouths, full of sharp Teeth, and their Tails being long trail after them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many of the Learned maintain a Dispute concerning Civet, Whether it be the
Seed of the Civet-Cat? the Affirmative, which <i>Cardanus</i> maintain’d, is contradicted
by <i>Julius Scaliger</i>. <i>Matthiolus</i>, an Author of no little credit, supposes that Civet is
the Sweat of the Cat, because it is most chiefly taken when these Beasts are exceedingly
vex’d and wearied: But since the Sweat runs from all parts of the Body,
which nevertheless do not all produce Civet, it is impossible that Sweat should be
Civet. Others account Civet to be the Dung of the Cats; which last seems to
come nearest to truth: for certainly it is nothing else but an Excrement in the
fleshy parts about their Pizzle, or near the Fundament. The Cats being in pain
to be discharg’d of this Civet, free themselves from it by rubbing a Tree; and also
fawn on those which take it from them with a Spoon.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Plin.</i> lib. 32. cap. 3.</div>

<p class='c010'>Besides all other wild Creatures, the Countrey according to <i>Adrian Vander
Donk</i>, produces yearly eighty thousand Beavers. <i>Pliny</i> relates, that these Beasts bite
off their Pizzles and throw them to the Hunter, which are an exceeding good Medicine
to help Abortion, stop the Monethly Flowers, Giddiness in the Head,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Gout, Lameness, Belly and Tooth-ach, Rhumes, Poyson, and the Evil. But <i>Pliny</i>
makes a great mistake herein, for the Beavers have a small Pissel fasten’d to their
Back-bone, in such a manner, that they cannot loose them but with hazard of their
lives: They live in the Water, and on the Shore, in great companies together, in
Nests built of Wood, which deserve no small admiration, being made after this
manner: The Beavers first gather all the loose Wood, which they find along the
Banks of the Rivers, of which, if there be not enough, they bite the Bark off from
the Trees in the neighboring Woods, then with their Tusks, of which two grow
above, and two below in their Mouths, they gnaw the main body of the Tree so
long, till it drops asunder: Their Nests very artificial, are six Stories high, cover’d
on the top with Clay to keep out Rain; in the middle is a passage which goes to
the River, into which they run so soon as they perceive a Man; to which purpose
one of them stands Sentinel, and in the Winter keeps open the Water from freezing,
by continual moving of his Tail, which is flat without Hair, and the most
delicious Meat that can be had. The Beavers go big sixteen Weeks, and once a
year bring forth four young, which suck and cry like young Children, for the
Dam of them rises on her hinder Feet, and gives her Teats, which grow between
the fore-legs to two of her young, each of them one; the foremost legs of a Beaver
resemble those of a Dog, the hindermost those of a Goose; on each side of the vent
are two swellings within two thin Skins; out of their vent runs generally an Oily
moysture, with which they anoint all the parts of their body which they can reach,
to keep them from being wet; within they are like a cut-up Hog; they live on the
Leaves and Barks of Trees; they love their young ones exceedingly; the long
Hairs, which shining, stick out on the back, fall off in Summer, and grow again
against Harvest; they have short Necks, strong Sinews and Legs, and move very
swiftly in the Water, and on the Land; if incompass’d by Men or Dogs, they bite
most severely; the right <i>Castoreum</i>, so highly esteem’d by Physicians, is a long <i>Vesica</i>,
not unlike a Pear, within the body of the female Beaver, the <i>Indians</i> mince the Cods
of the Male Beavers amongst their Tobacco, because they produce no <i>Castoreum</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fowls in <i>New York</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Country abounds also with Fowls; for besides Hawks, Kites, and other
Birds of Prey, there are abundance of Cranes, of several sorts, some grey, some
brown, others quite white; all of them have firm Bodies, and Bones without Marrow,
Claws of a finger long, strong and crooked Bills, their Brains dry, their Eyes
little and hollow, hard Features, the left Foot lesser than the right, both deform’d,
their Blood thick, and the Excrements of a horrid smell; they breed most in old
Woods, whose ground is without Brambles, and also near the Water, for they
feed on Fish, and devour all sorts of Fowls, nay, snatch up Hares, Rabbets, Tortels,
and several other sorts of Animals, which they carry away with them in the
Air; nay, when hungry, they seize on one another; some of them fly abroad for
their prey about noon, others at Sun-rising; they fall like Lightning on what e’re
they pursue; they drink little, except the Blood of those Creatures which they devour;
they are very libidinous, coupling above thirty times a day, not only with
their like, but also with the Hens of Hawks, and other Birds; they lay their biggest
Eggs in thirty days, and the lesser in twenty days; they generally bring forth
three young; those of them that cannot endure to look full against the Sun, are
thrown out of their Nests; the young ones when they begin to be fledg’d, are by
the old carry’d into the Air, and let flie, but supported by them; their sight is
wonderful quick; for though they flie as high as ever they are able to be discern’d,
yet they can see the least Fish that is in the Water, and a Hare lying in the Bushes:
their Breath stinks horribly, wherefore their Carcases suddenly rot; though they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>are libidinous, yet they live long; most of them die of hunger, because their Bills
when they grow old, grow so crooked, that they cannot open the same, wherefore
they flie up into the Air against the Sun, and falling into the coldest Rivers,
loose their Feathers and die.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Pigeons.</div>

<p class='c010'>Besides the foremention’d Birds of prey, there are abundance of Storks, Ravens,
Crows, Owls, Swallows, Gold-finches, Ice-birds, Kites, Quails, Pheasants, and
Winter <i>Kings</i>, and which are most remarkable for their rich Feathers, the <i>Spechtes</i>,
they pick great holes in Trees, and make a noise as if a Man were cutting down a
Tree. The Pigeons flie in such flocks, that the <i>Indians</i> remove with them to the
place where they make their Nests, where the young ones being taken by hundreds,
serve them for a Moneths Provision.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Pretty Birds.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, <i>New York</i> breeds a strange Bird about a Thumb long, full of glistering
Feathers; it lives by sucking of Flowers like a Bee, and is so tender, that
it immediately dies if water be spirted upon it; the Carcase being dry’d, is kept
for a Rarity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Turkies.</div>

<p class='c010'>But this Countrey abounds chiefly in Turkies, whose plenty deserves no less
admiration than their bulk, and the delicious taste of their Flesh, for they go feeding
forty or fifty in a flock, and weigh sometime forty or fifty pound apiece; the Natives
either shoot them, or take them with a Bait stuck on an Angle: In <i>March</i> and
Harvest the Waters swarm with Geese, Teal, Snites, Ducks, and Pelicans, besides
many strange sorts of Fowls not known in <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fish.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Rivers and Lakes produce Sturgeon, Salmon, Carps, Pearch, Barbils, all
sorts of Eels, and many other Fish which are taken near Water-falls: The Sea affords
Crabs with and without Shells, Sea-cocks, and Horses, Cod, Whiting, Ling,
Herrings, Mackrel, Flounders, Tar-buts, Tortels, and Oysters, of which some are
a Foot long, and have Pearl, but are a little brownish.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Rattle-Snake.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Amongst the Poysonous Creatures which infest <i>New York</i>, the chiefest and most
dangerous is the <i>Rattle-Snake</i>, whose description we have already had at large in
<i>New England</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Constitution of the Inhabitants.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Diet.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Inhabitants have their Hair black as Jet, harsh like Horse-hair; they are
broad Shoulder’d, small Wasted, brown Ey’d, their Teeth exceeding white; with
Water they chiefly quench their Thirst: Their general Food is Flesh, Fish, and <i>Indian</i>
Wheat, which stamp’d, is boyl’d to a Pap, by them call’d <i>Sappaen</i>: They observe
no set time to Eat, but when they have an Appetite their Meals begin. Beavers
Tails are amongst them accounted a great Dainty: When they go to Hunt, they
live several days on parch’d Corn, which they carry in little Bags ty’d about their
middle; a little of that said Corn thrown into Water swells exceedingly.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Hudson</i>’s adventures remarkable.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Henry Hudson</i> relates, That Sailing in the River <i>Montains</i>, in forty Degrees, he
saw the <i>Indians</i> make strange Gestures in their Dancing and Singing; he observ’d
farther, that they carry’d Darts pointed with sharp Stones, Sodder’d to the Wood;
that they slept under the Sky on Mats or Leaves; took much Tobacco, and very
strong; and that though courteous and friendly, they were very Thieves. He
Sailing thirty Leagues further, went in his Boat to an old <i>Indian</i> Commander of
forty Men and seventeen Women, who conducted him to the Shore, where they all
dwelt in one House, artificially built of the Barks of Oak-trees; round about it
lay above three Ships load of Corn, and <i>Indian</i> Beans to dry, besides the Plants
which grew in the Fields. No sooner had <i>Hudson</i> enter’d the House, but he was
receiv’d on two Mats spread on the ground; and two Men immediately were sent
out to shoot Venison or Fowls; and instantly returning, brought two Pigeons; a
fat Dog, whom they nimbly flea’d with shells, was also laid down to the fire:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>They also made other Preparations for <i>Hudsons</i> Entertainment, but not willing to
venture himself amongst them, that Night, tasted not of it, notwithstanding the <i>Indians</i>
breaking their Darts, threw them into the fire, that thereby they might drive
away all fears and jealousies from him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>New Netherlanders</i> Apparel.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Habits of the Natives, especially of the Men, are few; the Women go more
neat than the Men; and though the Winter pinches them with excessive cold, yet
they go naked till their thirteenth year: Both Men and Women wear a Girdle of
Whale-fins and <i>Sea-shells</i>; the Men put a piece of Cloth, half an Ell long, and
three quarters broad, between their Legs, so that a square piece hangs behind below
his Back, and another before over his Belly. The Women wear a Coat which
comes half way down their Legs, so curiously wrought with <i>Sea-shells</i>, that one Coat
sometimes costs thirty Pounds. Moreover, their Bodies are cover’d with Deer-skins,
the lappets or ends of which hang full of Points; a large Skin button’d on
the right Shoulder, and ty’d about the middle, serves for an upper Garment, and
in the Night for a Blanket: Both Men and Women go for the most part bare-headed;
the Women tie their Hair behind in a tuft, over which they wear a square
Cap wrought with <i>Sea-shells</i>, with which they adorn their Foreheads, and also wear
the same about their Neck and Hands, and some also about their middle. Before
the <i>Hollanders</i> were Planted here, they wore Shoes and Stockings of <i>Buffelo</i>’s-skins;
some likewise made Shoes of Wheaten-straw, but of late they come nearer to our
Fashions: The Men Paint their Faces with several Colours; the Women only
put here and there a black Spot; both of them are very reserv’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their houses.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Remove.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Houses are most of them built of one fashion, onely differing in length;
all of them agree in breadth of twenty Foot: They build after this manner, they
set Peel’d Boughs of Nut-Trees in the ground, according to the bigness of the
place which they intend to build, then joyning the tops of the Boughs together,
they cover the Walls and top with the Bark of Cypress, Ashen, and Chest-nut-Trees,
which are laid one upon another, the smallest side being turn’d inwards:
according to the bigness of the Houses, several Families, to the number of fifteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>dwell together, every one having his Apartment. Their Fortifications are most of
them built on steep Hills, near Rivers; the access to them is onely at one place,
they are built after this manner: They set great Poles in the Ground, with Oaken
<i>Pallisadoes</i> on each side, cross-ways one amongst another; between the crosses they
set other Trees, to strengthen the Work: Within this inclos’d they generally build
twenty or thirty Houses, of which some are a hundred and eighty Foot long, and
some less, all of them full of People: In the Summer they pitch Tents along by
the River side to Fish; against Winter they remove into the Woods, to be near
their Game of Hunting, and also Fuel.</p>

<p class='c010'>To take many Women is not customary here, only amongst Military Officers,
who Marry three or four Wives, which so well agree, that there is never any difference
betwixt them; those that are not of Age, never Marry but with the consent
and advice of their Parents: Widows and unmarry’d Men follow their own opinion
and choice; only they take Cognizance of their Estates and Extraction: The
Bridegroom always presents the Bride; for the least offence, the Man after having
soundly beaten his Wife, turns her out of Doors, and Marries another, insomuch,
that some of them have every year a new Wife: On breach of Marriage, the Children
follow the Mother, from whom they account their Generation: They account
Adultery, if committed under the bare Canopy of Heaven, a great Sin:
Whoring is Licenc’d to single Women, if they receive Money for it, and no Man
scruples to Marry them; nay, those that are Marry’d, boast how many they have
enjoy’d before their Marriage: She that is inclin’d to Marry, covers her whole
body, and sets her self wrapt up in the middle of the way, where a Batchelor
passing by sees her, and makes up the Match blindfold: When impregnated, they
take great care that their Fruit receives no hindrance nor prejudice: When the
time of their Delivery approaches, (which they know exactly) they go to a Melancholly
place in the Woods, though in the coldest Weather, where they raise up a
Hut of Mats, and bring the Child into the World without any help or Company,
wash the Child in cold Water, and wrap it up in Mats; then a few days after going
home, they bring up the Infant with great care, none putting them out to
Nurse: So long as a Woman gives suck, or is quick with Child, she will not admit
of Copulation; one who hath the Flowers, never comes abroad: In time of
sickness they faithfully assist one another: When any die, the nearest Relations
shut their Eyes; and after having watch’d them some days, they are Interr’d after
this manner: The Corps is plac’d sitting with a Stone under its Head, near it they
set a Pot, Kettle, Dish, Spoons, Money, and Provisions to use in the other World;
then they pile Wood round about it, and cover it over with Planks, on which
throwing Earth and Stones, they set <i>Pallisadoes</i>, and make the Grave like a House,
to which they shew Veneration, wherefore they account it a great piece of villany
to deface any thing of it: The Men make no shew of sorrow over the Dead, but
the Women mourn exceedingly, and carry themselves very strangely, beating their
Breasts, scratching their Faces, and calling night and day on the name of the Deceas’d:
The Mothers make great Lamentation at the Death of their Children, especially
Sons, for they shave off the Hair of their Heads, which at the Funeral is
burnt in the presence of all their Relations; which is also perform’d by the Women
when their Husbands die; besides, they black all their Faces, and putting on
a Hart-skin Shirt, mourn a whole year, notwithstanding they liv’d very contentiously
together.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Conjurers.</div>

<p class='c010'>On some occasions they go a Worshipping of the Devil, to a certain place where
the Sorcerers shew strange Feats of Activity, tumbling over and over, beating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>themselves, and not without great noise leaping in and about a great Fire: at last
they make a great Cry all together; upon which (as they say) the Devil appears to
them in the shape either of a tame or wild Beast: the first signifies bad, and the other
good fortune; both inform them of future Events, though darkly; and if the business
fall out contrary, they affirm that they have not rightly understood the Devil’s
meaning. Moreover they bewitch some in such a manner, that they foam at
the Mouth, throw themselves into the Fire, and beat themselves severely; and so
soon as they whisper in the Ear of those whom they have bewitch’d, they immediately
recover their former health.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Language of the <i>New Netherlanders</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Language of this Countrey is very various, yet it is divided into onely four
principal Tongues, as the <i>Manhattans</i>, <i>Wappanoo</i>, <i>Siavanoo</i>, and <i>Minqua</i>’s, which are
very difficult for Strangers to learn, because they are spoken without any Grounds
or Rules.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Money.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Money is made of the innermost Shells of a certain Shell-fish, cast up
twice a year by the Sea: These Shells they grind smooth, and make a Hole in
the middle, cutting them of an exact bigness, and so put them on Strings, which
then serve in stead of Gold, Silver, and Copper Coin.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Vices and Vertues.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Stoves.</div>

<p class='c010'>Now to say something of the Vices and Vertues of the Inhabitants. They are
in the first place very slovenly and nasty, stubborn, covetous, revengeful, and much
addicted to filching and stealing. Some appear reserv’d, using few words, which
they utter after serious consideration, and remember a long time. Their Understandings
being improv’d by the <i>Hollanders</i>, they are quick of apprehension, to distinguish
good from bad: they will not endure any Oppression, but are very patient
of Heat, Cold, Hunger and Thirst. They have a strange way of using Stoves, which
are set in the Ground and cover’d with Earth, into which they go through a little
Door. A sick Person coming into the same, sets himself down, and places hot
Stones round about him; which done, and having sweat a considerable time, he
leaps into cold Water, by which he finds ease of all his Distempers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Arms.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable actions of some Prisoners.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Laws.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Council-Assembly.</div>

<p class='c010'>Though these People know no great distinction between Man and Man, as
other Nations, yet they have noble and ignoble Families amongst them; superior
and inferior Offices, which they enjoy by Inheritance; but sometimes the Martial
Offices are bestowed according to the Valour of the Persons: Their Generals seldom
give their Enemies a Field-Battel, by drawing or dividing their Men into Regiments
or Companies, but make it their whole Design to defeat their Enemies by
sudden Sallies from Ambuscado’s; for they never stand out a close Fight, unless
compell’d to it, but if encompass’d round, they fight to the last Man. When any
danger threatens, the Women and Children are convey’d to a secure place. Their
Arms formerly were Bowes and Arrows, and Battel-axes, but now they use Musquets,
which they have learn’d to handle with great dexterity. Their square
Shields cover all their Bodies and Shoulders. About their Heads they tie a Snakes
Skin, in the middle of which sticks either a Fox’s or Bear’s Tail. They cannot be
known by their Faces, they are all over so besmear’d with Paint of divers colours.
They seldom give Quarter to their Enemies, except Women and Children, which
the Conquerors use as their own, that by that means they may increase and
strengthen themselves: and if any Prisoner is not kill’d presently after the Battel,
but falls into the Hands of one whose Relations have formerly been slain by his
Party, he is Roasted three days by degrees before he gives up the Ghost. It deserves
no small admiration, that the Sufferer during the whole time of his Torture,
Sings till he breathes his last. They have few or no Punishments for any Offence,
committing few Crimes which are by them accounted Capital. If any one steal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>and the Goods be found in his custody, the Governor of the place where he resides
commands him onely to restore the same to the Owner. If any one murther or kill
the other, the Relations of the slain, if they can take the Malefactor in twenty four
hours, may without Examination or delay put him to death also; but that time
being once expir’d, the Revenger is liable to be kill’d in the same time by his Relations
whom he slew. All Obligations have their power and vertue from certain
Presents deliver’d upon the making of a Contract, which is done thus: They dry
as many Sticks as they have Articles, which if they agree upon, every Man on the
concluding of the Discourse lays a Present before the others Feet. Sometimes they
hang up the Presents, because they are often three days in Consultation before they
resolve; after which if the Presents be taken down, it is a certain sign of their
Agreement; but if not, they proceed no farther, unless the Articles and Presents
are alter’d. On Businesses of consequence the Commonalty repair to their Governor’s
House, there to hear and enquire what the Nobility there assembled have
concluded or resolv’d on; at which the best Orator standing up, tells them their
Intentions. It happens sometimes that a turbulent Person making a Mutiny, and
refusing to hearken to reason, is immediately beheaded by one of the Nobility;
in contradiction of which none dare presume to speak the least word.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Religion.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Diabolical Worship.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Their ridiculous Opinion of God.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>As also of the Creation.</div>

<p class='c010'>There are scarce any steps of Religion found amongst these People, onely they
suppose the Moon to have great influence on Plants. The Sun, which over-looks
all things, is call’d to witness whene’re they Swear. They bear great respect, and
stand much in fear of <i>Satan</i>, because they are often plagued by him when they go a
Hunting or Fishing: wherefore the first of what they take is burnt in honor of
him, that he to whom they ascribe all wickedness might not hurt them. When
they feel pain in any part of their Body, they say that the Devil sits in the same.
They acknowledge that there resides a God above the Stars, but troubles not himself
with what the Devil doth on Earth, because he continually recreates himself
with a most beautiful Goddess, whose original is unknown: She on a certain time
(say they) descended from Heaven into the Water, (for before the Creation all
things were Water) into which she had instantly sunk, had not the Earth arose under
her Feet, which grew immediately to such a bigness, that there appear’d a
World of Earth, which produc’d all sorts of Herbs and Trees; whilst the Goddess
taking to her self a Hart, Bear, and Wolf, and Conceiving by them, she was not long
after deliver’d of several Beasts at one time: and from thence proceeded not onely
the diversity of Beasts, but also Men, of which some are black, white, or sallow;
in nature fearful like a Hart, or cruel and valiant like a Bear, or deceitful like
Wolves: after this the Mother of all things ascended up to Heaven again, and
sported there with the Supream Lord, whom they say they know not, because they
never saw him: wherefore they shall have less to answer for than <i>Christians</i>, which
pretend to know him to be the Punisher of things both good and bad, which are
daily committed by them: and for this ridiculous Opinion they can hardly be
brought to embrace the <i>Christian</i> Faith.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of the Immortality of the Soul.</div>

<p class='c010'>Concerning the Souls of the Deceased, they believe, that those which have been
good in their life-time, live Southward in a temperate Countrey, where they enjoy
all manner of pleasure and delight; when as the Wicked wander up and down in a
miserable Condition. The Eccho which resounds from the Cries of wild Beasts in
the Night, they suppose to be the Spirits of Souls transmigrated into wicked
Bodies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their <i>Canticas</i>, or Dancing.</div>

<p class='c010'>At their <i>Canticas</i>, or Dancing-Matches, where all Persons that come are freely
Entertain’d, it being a Festival time. Their Custom is when they Dance, for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Spectators to have short Sticks in their Hands, and to knock the Ground and Sing
altogether, whilst they that Dance sometimes act Warlike postures, and then they
come in painted for War with their Faces black and red, or some all black, some all
red, with some streaks of white under their Eyes, and so jump and leap up and
down without any order, uttering many Expressions of their intended Valour.
For other Dances they onely shew what antick Tricks their ignorance will lead
them to, wringing of their Bodies and Faces after a strange manner, sometimes
jumping into the Fire, sometimes catching up a Firebrand, and biting off a live
Coal, with many such tricks, that will affright rather than please an <i>English</i>-man
to look upon them, resembling rather a company of infernal Furies than Men.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their sitting in Council.</div>

<p class='c010'>When their King or <i>Sachem</i> sits in Council, he hath a Company of Arm’d Men to
guard his Person, great respect being shewn him by the People, which is principally
manifested by their silence. After he hath declared the cause of their Convention,
he demands their Opinion, ordering who shall begin: The Person order’d
to speak, after he hath declar’d his mind, tells them he hath done: no Man
ever interrupting any Person in his Speech, nor offering to speak, though he make
never so many long stops, till he says he hath no more to say. The Council having
all declar’d their Opinions, the King after some pause gives the definitive Sentence,
which is commonly seconded with a shout from the People, every one seeming to
applaud and manifest their Assent to what is determin’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>If any Person be condemn’d to die, which is seldom, unless for Murther or Incest,
the King himself goes out in Person (for you must understand they have no
Prisons, and the guilty Person flies into the Woods) where they go in quest of him,
and having found him, the King shoots first, though at never such a distance,
and then happy is the Man that can shoot him down; for he that hath the fortune
to be Executioner, is for his pains made some Captain, or other Military
Officer.</p>

<p class='c010'>They grease their Bodies and Hair very often, and paint their Faces with several
Colours, as black, white, red, yellow, blue, <i>&amp;c.</i> which they take great pride in,
every one being painted in a several manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>Within two Leagues of <i>New York</i> lieth <i>Staten-Island</i>, it bears from <i>New York</i> West
something Southerly: It is about twenty Miles long, and four or five broad, most
of it very good Land, full of Timber, and producing all such Commodities as
<i>Long-Island</i> doth, besides Tin and store of Iron Oar; and the <i>Calamine</i> Stone is said
likewise to be found there: There is but one Town upon it, consisting of <i>English</i>
and <i>French</i>, but it is capable of entertaining more Inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c010'>Betwixt this and <i>Long-Island</i> is a large Bay, which is the coming in for all Ships
and Vessels out of the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the North-side of this Island <i>After-skull</i> River puts into the Main Land, on
the West-side whereof there are two or three Towns, but on the East-side but one.
There are very great Marshes or Meadows on both sides of it, excellent good Land,
and good convenience for the setling of several Towns. There grows black Walnut
and Locust, as there doth in <i>Virginia</i>, with mighty, tall, streight Timber, as good
as any in the North of <i>America</i>: It produceth any Commodity which <i>Long-Island</i>
doth.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Hudson</i>’s River runs by <i>New York</i> Northward into the Countrey, towards the
Head of which is seated <i>New Albany</i>, a Place of great Trade with the <i>Indians</i>, betwixt
which and <i>New York</i>,  being above a hundred Miles, is as good Corn-Land as
the World affords, enough to entertain hundreds of Families, which in the time of
the <i>Dutch</i> Government of these Parts could not be setled by reason of the <i>Indians</i>, excepting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>one Place, call’d <i>The Sopers</i>, which was kept by a Garrison, but since the Reducement
of these Parts under His Majesties Obedience, and a Patent granted to
his Royal Highness the Duke of <i>York</i>, which is about six years, by the care and diligence
of the Honorable Collonel <i>Nichols</i>, sent thither as Deputy to his Highness,
such a League of Peace was made, and Friendship concluded betwixt that Colony
and the <i>Indians</i>, that they have not resisted or disturb’d any <i>Christians</i> there, in the
setling or peaceable possessing of any Lands within that Government, but every
Man hath sat under his own Vine, and hath peaceably reap’d and enjoy’d the Fruits
of their own Labors, which God continue.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Raritan-River.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Westward of <i>After-skull</i> River before mention’d, about eighteen or twenty Miles,
runs in <i>Raritan</i> River Northward into the Countrey some scores of Miles; both
sides of which River are adorn’d with spacious Meadows, enough to feed thousands
of Cattel: The Wood-Land is very good for Corn, and stor’d with wild Beasts,
as Deer, Elks, and an innumerable multitude of Fowl, as in other parts of the
Countrey. This River is thought very capable for the erecting of several Towns
and Villages on each side of it, no place in the North of <i>America</i> having better convenience
for the maintaining of all sorts of Cattel for Winter and Summer Food.</p>

<p class='c010'>Upon this River is no Town setled, onely one at the Mouth of it; but next to it,
Westward, is a Place call’d <i>Newasons</i>; where are two or three Towns and Villages
setled upon the Sea-side, but none betwixt that and <i>Delaware-Bay</i>, which is about
sixty Miles, all which is a rich Champain Countrey, free from Stones, and indifferent
level, having store of excellent good Timber, and very well water’d, having
Brooks or Rivers ordinarily, one or more in every Miles travel. This Countrey
is peopled onely with wild Beasts, as Deer, Elks, Bears, and other Creatures, so
that in a whole days Journey you shall meet with no Inhabitants except a few
<i>Indians</i>. It is also full of stately Oaks, whose broad-branch’d tops serve for no other
use, but to keep off the Suns heat from the wild Beasts of the Wilderness, where is
Grass as high as a Man’s Middle, which serves for no other end, except to maintain
the Elks and Deer, who never devour a hundredth part of it, than to be burnt
every Spring to make way for new. How many poor People in the World would
think themselves happy, had they an Acre or two of Land, whilst here is hundreds,
nay thousands of Acres that would invite Inhabitants.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Delaware-Bay.</i></div>

<p class='c010'><i>Delaware-Bay</i>, the Mouth of the River, lieth about the mid way betwixt <i>New
York</i> and the <i>Capes</i> of <i>Virginia</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The best Commodities for any to carry with them to this Countrey is Clothing,
the Countrey being full of all sorts of Cattel, which they may furnish themselves
withal at an easie Rate, for any sort of <i>English</i> Goods, as likewise Instruments for
Husbandry and Building, with Nails, Hinges, Glass, and the like. They get a Livelihood
principally by Corn and Cattel, which will there fetch them any Commodities:
Likewise they Sowe store of Flax, which they make every one Cloth of for
their own wearing; as also Woollen Cloth, and Linsey-woolsey; and had they
more Tradesmen amongst them, they would in a little time live without the help
of any other Countrey for their Clothing; for Tradesmen there are none but live
happily there, as Carpenters, Blacksmiths, Masons, Taylors, Weavers, Shoemakers,
Tanners, Brickmakers, and so any other Trade: Them that have no Trade betake
themselves to Husbandry, get Land of their own, and live exceeding well.</p>

<p class='c010'>We shall conclude our Discourse of this Countrey with a notable Character given
thereof by a late Writer, as to the great advantage of happy living in all respects,
for whosoever shall be pleas’d to betake himself thither to live.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Character of a happy Countrey.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>“If there be any terrestrial happiness (saith he) to be had by any People, especially
of an inferior rank, it must certainly be here. Here any one may furnish
himself with Land, and live Rent-free, yea, with such a quantity of Land, that
he may weary himself with walking over his Fields of Corn, and all sorts of
Grain, and let his Stock amount to some hundreds; he needs not fear there want
of Pasture in the Summer, or Fodder in the Winter, the Woods affording sufficient
supply, where you have Grass as high as a Man’s Knees, nay, as high as his
Waste, interlac’d with Pea-Vines, and other Weeds that Cattel much delight in,
as much as a Man can pass through: And these Woods also every Mile or half-Mile
are furnish’d with fresh Ponds, Brooks, or Rivers, where all sorts of Cattel,
during the heat of the day, do quench their thirst, and cool themselves. These
Brooks and Rivers being inviron’d of each side with several sorts of Trees and
Grape-Vines, Arbor-like interchanging places, and crossing these Rivers, do shade
and shelter them from the scorching beams of the Sun. Such as by their utmost
Labors can scarcely get a Living, may here procure Inheritances of Lands and
Possessions, stock themselves with all sorts of Cattel, enjoy the benefit of them
whilst they live, and leave them to their Children when they die. Here you need
not trouble the Shambles for Meat, nor Bakers and Brewers for Beer and Bread,
nor run to a Linnen-Draper for a supply, every one making their own Linnen,
and a great part of their woollen Cloth for their ordinary wearing. And how
prodigal (if I may so say) hath Nature been to furnish this Countrey with all
sorts of wild Beasts and Fowl, which every one hath an interest in, and may Hunt
at his pleasure; where, besides the pleasure in Hunting, he may furnish his House
with excellent fat Venison, Turkies, Geese, Heath-hens, Cranes, Swans, Ducks,
Pigeons, and the like; and wearied with that, he may go a Fishing, where the
Rivers are so furnish’d, that he may supply himself with Fish before he can leave
off the Recreation. Here one may travel by Land upon the same Continent
hundreds of Miles, and pass through Towns and Villages, and never hear the
least complaint for want, nor hear any ask him for a Farthing. Here one may
lodge in the Fields and Woods, travel from one end of the Countrey to another,
with as much security as if he were lock’d within his own Chamber: And if
one chance to meet with an <i>Indian</i> Town, they shall give him the best Entertainment
they have, and upon his desire direct him on his Way. But that which
adds happiness to all the rest, is the healthfulness of the Place, where many People
in twenty years time never know what Sickness is; where they look upon it
as a great Mortality, if two or three die out of a Town in a years time. Besides
the sweetness of the Air, the Countrey it self sends forth such a fragrant smell,
that it may be perceiv’d at Sea before they can make the Land: No evil Fog or
Vapor doth any sooner appear, but a North-West or Westerly Wind immediately
dissolves it, and drives it away. Moreover, you shall scarce see a House, but the
South-side is begirt with Hives of Bees, which increase after an incredible manner:
So that if there be any terrestrial <i>Canaan</i>, ’tis surely here, where the Land
floweth with Milk and Honey.”</p>

Before We proceed to the Description of this Countrey, it
will be first requisite to relate the true occasion and means,
whereby this part of <i>America</i> came to be erected into a Province,
and call’d <i>Mary-land</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The situation.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the Year of our Lord 1631. <i>George</i> Lord <i>Baltemore</i> obtain’d
of King <i>Charles</i> the First, of <i>Great Brittain, &amp;c.</i> a Grant
of that part of <i>America</i>, (first discover’d by the <i>English</i>)
which lies between the Degrees of thirty seven and fifty
Minutes, or thereabouts, and forty of Northerly Latitude; which is bounded on
the South by <i>Virginia</i>; on the North, by <i>New England</i>, and <i>New Jersey</i>, part of <i>New
York</i>, lying on the East side of <i>Delaware Bay</i>; on the East, by the Ocean; and on
the West, by that part of the Continent which lies in the Longitude of the first
Fountains of the River call’d <i>Patomeck</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In pursuance of this Grant to his said Lordship, a Bill was prepar’d, and brought
to His Majesty to Sign, who first ask’d his Lordship, what he should call it, there
being a Blank in the Bill designedly left for the Name, which his Lordship intended
should have been <i>Crescentia</i>; but his Lordship leaving it to His Majesty to give
it a Name, the King propos’d to have it call’d <i>Terra-Mariæ</i>, in <i>English</i>, <i>Mary-land</i>, in
honor of his Queen, whose Name was <i>Mary</i>; which was concluded on, and inserted
into the Bill, which the King then Sign’d; and thereby the said Tract of Land
was erected into a Province by that Name.</p>

<p class='c010'>His Lordship somewhat delaying the speedy passing of it under the Great Seal
of <i>England</i>, dy’d in the <i>interim</i>, before the said Patent was perfected; whereupon a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Patent of the said Province was shortly afterwards pass’d to his Son and Heir,
(who was Christen’d by the Name of <i>Cœcil</i>, but afterwards confirm’d by the Name
of <i>Cœcilius</i>,) the now Lord <i>Baltemore</i>, under the Great Seal of <i>England</i>, bearing Date
<i>June 20. 1632.</i> in the eighth Year of His said Majesties Reign, with all Royal Jurisdictions
and Prerogatives, both Military and Civil in the said Province, as Power
to Enact Laws, Power of pardoning all manner of Offences, Power to confer
Honors, <i>&amp;c.</i> to be held of His said Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, Kings of <i>England</i>
in common Soccage, as of His Majesties Honor of <i>Windsor</i> in the County of
<i>Berks</i> in <i>England</i>; yielding and paying yearly for the same to His Majesty and to His
Heirs and Successors for ever, two <i>Indian</i> Arrows of those parts, at the Castle of
<i>Windsor</i> aforesaid, on Tuesday in <i>Easter</i> Week, and the fifth part of all Gold and Silver
Oar, which shall happen to be found in the said Province.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Bounds.</div>

<p class='c010'>“By the said Patent is Granted to his Lordship, his Heirs and Assigns, all that
part of a <i>Peninsula</i>, lying in the parts of <i>America</i>, between the Ocean on the East,
and the Bay of <i>Chesapeack</i> on the West; and divided from the other part thereof
by a right Line drawn from the Promontory, or <i>Cape</i> of Land call’d <i>Watkin’s-Point</i>,
situate in the aforesaid Bay, near the River of <i>Wigcho</i> on the West, unto the
main Ocean on the East, and between that bound on the South, unto that part
of <i>Delaware Bay</i> on the North, which lies under the fortieth Degree of Northerly
Latitude from the Equinoctial, where <i>New England</i> ends; and all that Tract of
Land between the bounds aforesaid, that is to say, passing from the aforesaid
Bay call’d <i>Delaware Bay</i>, in a right Line by the Degree aforesaid, unto the true
<i>Meridian</i> of the first Fountains of the River of <i>Patomeck</i>; and from thence stretching
towards the South, unto the furthest Bank of the said River, and following
the West and South side thereof, unto a certain place call’d <i>Cinquack</i>, near the
Mouth of the said River, where it falls into the Bay of <i>Chesapeack</i>, and from thence
by a streight Line unto the aforesaid Promontory, or place call’d <i>Watkin’s-Point</i>,
which lies in thirty seven Degrees and fifty Minutes, or thereabouts, of Northern
Latitude.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Title.</div>

<p class='c010'>By this Patent his Lordship and his Heirs and Assigns are Created the true and
absolute Lords and Proprietaries of the said Province, saving the Allegiance and
Soveraign Dominion due to His Majesty, His Heirs, and Successors; so that he hath
thereby a Soveraignty Granted to him and his Heirs, dependant upon the Soveraignty
of the Crown of <i>England</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The first Seating.</div>

<p class='c010'>His Lordship, in the Year 1633. sent his second Brother Mr. <i>Leonard Calvert</i>, and
his third Brother Mr. <i>George Calvert</i>, with divers other Gentlemen of Quality, and
Servants to the number of two hundred Persons at least, to settle a Plantation
there; who set Sail from the <i>Cowes</i> in the <i>Isle of Wight</i> in <i>England</i>, on <i>Novemb. 22.</i>
in the same Year; having made some stay by the way, at the <i>Barbadoes</i> and <i>St. Christophers</i>
in <i>America</i>, they arriv’d at <i>Point Comfort</i> in <i>Virginia</i>, on <i>February 24.</i> following;
from whence shortly after they Sail’d up the Bay of <i>Chesapeack</i>, and <i>Patomeck</i> River.
And having review’d the Country, and given Names to several places, they
pitch’d upon a Town of the <i>Indians</i> for their first Seat, call’d <i>Yoacomaco</i>, (now Saint
<i>Maries</i>) which the then Governor Mr. <i>Leonard Calvert</i>, freely Purchas’d of the Natives
there, for the Lord Proprietaries use, with Commodities brought from
<i>England</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>That which facilitated the Treaty and Purchase of the said place from the <i>Indians</i>,
was a resolution which those <i>Indians</i> had then before taken, to remove higher
into the Countrey where it was more Populous, for fear of the <i>Sansquehanocks</i>,
(another, and more Warlike People of the <i>Indians</i>, who were their too near Neighbors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>and inhabit between the Bays of <i>Chesapeack</i> and <i>Delaware</i>) there being then
actual Wars between them, insomuch, that many of them were gone thither before
the <i>English</i> arriv’d: And it hath been the general practice of his Lordship, and
those who were employ’d by him in the Planting of the said Province, rather to
purchase the Natives Interest, (who will agree for the same at easie rates) than to
take from them by force, that which they seem to call their Right and Inheritance,
to the end all Disputes might be remov’d touching the forcible Incroachment upon
others, against the Laws of Nature or Nations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The number of Inhabitants.</div>

<p class='c010'>Thus this Province at the vast Charges, and by the unweary’d Industry and endeavor
of the present Lord <i>Baltemore</i>, the now absolute Lord and Proprietary of
the same was at first Planted, and hath since been supply’d with People and other
Necessaries, so effectually, that in this present Year 1671. the number of <i>English</i>
there amounts to fifteen or twenty thousand Inhabitants, for whose Encouragement
there is a Fundamental Law establish’d there by his Lordship, whereby <i>Liberty
of Conscience</i> is allow’d to all that Profess to believe in <i>Jesus Christ</i>; so that no
Man who is a <i>Christian</i> is in danger of being disturb’d for his Religion; and all
Persons being satisfi’d touching his Lordships Right, as Granted by his Superior Soveraign,
the King of <i>Great Brittain</i>, and possess’d by the consent and agreement of
the first <i>Indian</i> Owners, every Person who repaireth thither, intending to become
an Inhabitant, finds himself secure, as well in the quiet enjoyment of his Property,
as of his Conscience.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. <i>Charles Calvert</i>, his Lordships onely Son and Heir, was in the Year 1661.
sent thither by his Lordship to Govern this Province and People, who hath hitherto
continu’d that Charge of his Lordships Lieutenant there, to the general satisfaction
and encouragement of all Persons under his Government, or otherwise
concern’d in the Province.</p>

<p class='c010'>The precedent Discourse having given you a short Description of this Province
from its Infancy to this day, together with an account of his Lordships Patent and
Right, by which he holds the same; we will here speak something of the Nature of
the Countrey in general, and of the Commodities that are either naturally afforded
there, or may be procur’d by Industry.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Climate is very healthful, and agreeable with <i>English</i> Constitutions; but
New-comers have most of them heretofore had the first year of their Planting there
in <i>July</i> and <i>August</i>, a Sickness, which is call’d there <i>A Seasoning</i>, but is indeed no
other than an Ague, with cold and hot Fits, whereof many heretofore us’d to die
for want of good Medicines, and accommodations of Diet and Lodging, and by
drinking too much Wine and Strong-waters; though many, even in those times,
who were more temperate, and that were better accommodated, never had any
<i>Seasonings</i> at all; but of late years, since the Countrey hath been more open’d by
the cutting down of the Woods, and that there is more plenty of <i>English</i> Diet,
there are very few die of those Agues, and many have no <i>Seasonings</i> at all, especially
those that live in the higher parts of the Country, and not near to the Marshes and
Salt-water.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Summer, the heats are equal to those of <i>Spain</i>, but qualifi’d daily about Noon,
at that time of the Year, either with some gentle Breezes, or small Showres of
Rain: In Winter there is Frost and Snow, and sometimes it is extremely cold,
insomuch, that the Rivers and the Northerly part of the Bay of <i>Chesapeack</i> are Frozen,
but it seldom lasts long; and some Winters are so warm, that People have
gone in half Shirts and Drawers only at <i>Christmas</i>: But in the Spring and Autumn,
(<i>viz.</i>) in <i>March</i>, <i>April</i>, and <i>May</i>, <i>September</i>, <i>October</i>, and <i>November</i>, there is generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>most pleasant temperate Weather: The Winds there are variable, from the South
comes Heat, Gusts, and Thunder; from the North or North-West, cold Weather;
and in Winter, Frost and Snow; from the East and South-East, Rain.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Soyl is very fertile, and furnish’d with many pleasant and commodious
Rivers, Creeks, and Harbors.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Country is generally plain and even, and yet distinguish’d with some pretty
small Hills and Risings, with variety of Springs and Rivulets: The Woods are
for the most part free from Underwood, so that a Man may Travel or Hunt for his
Recreation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ordinary entrance by Sea into this Country is between two <i>Capes</i>, distant
each from the other about seven or eight Leagues; the South <i>Cape</i> is call’d <i>Cape
Henry</i>; the North, <i>Cape Charles</i>; within the <i>Capes</i> you enter into a fair <i>Bay</i>, Navigable
for at least two hundred Miles, and is call’d <i>Chesapeack Bay</i>, stretching it self
Northerly through the heart of the Countrey, which adds much to its Fame and
Value: Into this Bay fall many stately Rivers, the chief whereof is <i>Patomeck</i>, which
is Navigable for at least a hundred and forty Miles: The next Northward, is <i>Patuxent</i>,
at its entrance distant from the other about twenty Miles, a River yielding
great Profit as well as Pleasure to the Inhabitants; and by reason of the Islands and
other places of advantage that may Command it, both fit for Habitation and Defence:
Passing hence to the Head of the Bay, you meet with several pleasant and
commodious Rivers, which for brevity we here omit to give any particular account
of: On the Eastern Shore are several commodious Rivers, Harbors, Creeks,
and Islands; to the Northward whereof you enter into another fair Bay, call’d
<i>Delaware Bay</i>; wide at its entrance about eight Leagues, and into which falls a very
fair Navigable River.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The natural Commodities of the Countrey.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey yields the Inhabitants many excellent things for Physick and
Chyrurgery; they have several Herbs and Roots which are great Preservatives
against Poyson, as <i>Snake-Root</i>, which presently cures the bitings of the <i>Rattle-Snake</i>,
which are very Venomous, and are bred in the Countrey; others that cure all
manner of Wounds; they have <i>Saxafras</i>, <i>Sarsaparilla</i>, Gums and Balsoms, which
Experience (the Mother of Art) hath taught them the perfect use of.</p>

<p class='c010'>An <i>Indian</i> seeing one of the <i>English</i> much troubled with the Tooth-ach, fetch’d a
Root out of a Tree, which apply’d to the Tooth, gave ease immediately to the Party;
other Roots they have fit for Dyers, wherewith the <i>Indians</i> Paint themselves as
<i>Pacoone</i> (a deep red,) <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>The Timber of these parts is good and useful for Building of Houses and Ships,
the white Oak for Pipe-staves, the red for Wainscot; there is likewise black Wall-Nut,
Cedar, Pine, and Cypress, Chest-nut, Elme, Ash, and Popelar, all which are
for Building and Husbandry: Fruit-trees, as Mulberries, <i>Persimons</i>, with several
kind of Plumbs, and Vines in great abundance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of Strawberries there is plenty, which are ripe in <i>April</i>, Mulberries in <i>May</i>, Rasberries
in <i>June</i>, and the <i>Maracok</i>, which is something like a Lemon, is ripe in <i>August</i>.
In Spring time there are several sorts of Herbs, as Corn-sallet, Violets, Sorrel, Purslane,
and others which are of great use to the <i>English</i> there.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the upper parts of the Countrey are <i>Buffeloes</i>, <i>Elks</i>, <i>Tygers</i>, <i>Bears</i>, <i>Wolves</i>, and
great store of Deer; as also Beavers, Foxes, Otters, Flying-Squirils, <i>Racoons</i>, and
many other sorts of Beasts.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of Birds, there is the Eagle, Goshawk, Falcon, <i>Lanner</i>, Sparrow-hawk, and <i>Marlin</i>;
also wild Turkies in great abundance, whereof many weigh fifty Pounds in
weight and upwards, and of Partridge great plenty: There are likewise sundry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>sorts of singing Birds, whereof one is call’d a <i>Mock-Bird</i>, because it imitates all
other Birds; some are red, which sing like Nightingales, but much louder; others
black and yellow, which last sort excels more in Beauty than tune, and is by the
<i>English</i> there call’d the <i>Baltemore-Bird</i>, because the Colours of his Lordships Coat of
Arms are black and yellow: Others there are that resemble most of the Birds in
<i>England</i>, but not of the same kind, for which we have no names: In Winter there
are great plenty of Swans, Cranes, Geese, Herons, Duck, Teal, Widgeons, Brants,
and Pidgeons, with other sorts, whereof there are none in <i>England</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Sea, the Bays of <i>Chesapeack</i> and <i>Delaware</i>, and generally all the Rivers, do
abound with Fish of several sorts; as Whales, Sturgeon, Thorn-back, Grampuses,
Porpuses, Mullets, Trouts, Soules, Plaice, Mackrel, Perch, Eels, Roach, Shadd,
Herrings, Crabs, Oysters, Cockles, Mussels, <i>&amp;c.</i> but above all these, the Fish whereof
there are none in <i>England</i>, as <i>Drums</i>, <i>Sheeps-head</i>, <i>Cat-fish</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> are best, except Sturgeon,
which are there found in great abundance, not inferior to any in <i>Europe</i> for
largeness and goodness.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Minerals may in time prove of very great consequence, though no rich
Mines are yet discover’d there; but there is Oar of several sorts, <i>viz.</i> of Tin, Iron,
and Copper, whereof several trials have been made by curious Persons there with
good success.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Soyl is generally very rich, the Mould in many places black and rank, insomuch,
that it is necessary to Plant it first with <i>Indian</i> Corn, Tobacco, or Hemp,
before it is fit for <i>English</i> Grain; under that is found good <i>Loam</i>, whereof has been
made as good Brick as any in <i>Europe</i>: There are store of Marsh-grounds for Meadows;
great plenty of Marle, both blue and white; excellent Clay for Pots and
Tiles: To conclude, there is nothing that can be reasonably expected, in a place
lying in the same Latitude with this, but what is either there found naturally, or
may be procur’d by Industry, as Oranges, Lemons, and Olives, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Commodities which are, or may be procur’d by industry.</div>

<p class='c010'>We need not here mention <i>Indian</i> Corn, (call’d <i>Mayz</i>) Pease and Beans of several
sorts, being the peculiar products Planted by the <i>Indians</i> of that part of <i>America</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>All sorts of <i>English</i> Grain are now common there, and yield a great encrease; as
Wheat, Rye, Barley, Oats, Pease, Beans, <i>&amp;c.</i> good Beer of Wheat or Barley Malt,
after the <i>English</i> Mode, is made, even in the meanest Families there; Some drink
Beer of  <i>Indian</i> Corn, others of the Stalks thereof, or of the Chipps of the <i>Pockykerry</i>-Tree,
all which make a sort of fresh and pleasant Drink; but the general Diet of
the Country is now <i>English</i>, as most agreeable to their Constitutions.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are few able Planters there at present, but what are plentifully supply’d
with all sorts of Summer and Winter Fruits; as also of Roots and Herbs, of all
sorts out of their Gardens and Orchards, which they have Planted for their Profit as
well as Pleasure: They have Pears, Apples, Plumbs, Peaches, <i>&amp;c.</i> in great abundance,
and as good as those of <i>Italy</i>; so are their Mellons, Pumpions, Apricocks,
Cherries, Figgs, Pomegranates, <i>&amp;c.</i> In fine, there is scarce any Fruit or Root that
grows in <i>England</i>, <i>France</i>, <i>Spain</i>, or <i>Italy</i>, but hath been try’d there, and prospers
well.</p>

<p class='c010'>You may have there also Hemp, Flax, Pitch, and Tar, with little labor; the
Soyl is apt for Hops, Rape-seed, Annice-seed, Woad, Madder, Saffron, <i>&amp;c.</i> there
may be had Silk-worms, the Country being stor’d with Mulberry-trees, and the superfluity
of the Wood will produce Pot-ashes.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is a great quantity of Syder made there at present, and as good as in any
other Countrey; good Perry and Quince-drink is there likewise made in great
plenty: The Ground doth naturally bring forth Vines in great quantities, the quality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>whereof being something corrected by Industry, (as there have been several trials
thereof already made there) may no doubt produce good Wine, to the great encouragement
and advantage of the Undertakers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Brave Ships may be built there with little charge, Clab-board, Wainscot, Pipe-staves,
and Masts for Ships, the Woods will afford plentifully; some small Vessels
have been already built there: In fine, Beef, Furrs, Hides, Butter, Cheese,
Pork, and Bacon, to Transport to other Countreys, are no small Commodities,
which by Industry, are, and may be had there in great plenty, the <i>English</i> being already
plentifully stock’d with all sorts of Cattel and Horses; and were there no
other Staple-Commodities to be hop’d for, but Silk and Linnen (the materials of
which apparently will grow there) it were sufficient to enrich the Inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the general Trade of <i>Mary-land</i> at present depends chiefly upon Tobacco, it
being the Planters greatest concern and study to store himself betimes with that
Commodity, wherewith he buys and sells, and after which Standard all other
Commodities receive their Price there; they have of late vented such quantities of
that and other Commodities, that a hundred Sail of Ships from <i>England</i>, <i>Barbadoes</i>,
and other <i>English</i> Plantations, have been usually known to Trade thither in one
Year; insomuch, that by Custom and Excize paid in <i>England</i> for Tobacco and
other Commodities Imported from thence, <i>Mary-land</i> alone at this present, hath by
his Lordships vast Expence, Industry, and Hazard for many years, without any
charge to the Crown, improv’d His Majesties, the King of <i>Englands</i> Revenues, to the
value of Forty thousand Pounds <i>Sterl. per annum</i> at least.</p>

<p class='c010'>The general way of Traffick and Commerce there is chiefly by Barter, or Exchange
of one Commodity for another; yet there wants not, besides <i>English</i> and
other foraign Coyns, some of his Lordships own Coyn, as Groats, Sixpences, and
Shillings, which his Lordship at his own Charge caus’d to be Coyn’d and dispers’d
throughout that Province; ’tis equal in fineness of Silver to <i>English Sterling</i>, being
of the same Standard, but of somewhat less weight, and hath on the one side his
Lordships Coat of Arms stamp’d, with this Motto circumscrib’d, <i>Crescite &amp; Multiplicamini</i>,
and on the other side his Lordships Effigies, circumscrib’d thus, <i>Cæcilius
Dominus Terræ-Mariæ</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Government.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Order of Government and settled Laws of this Province, is by the Prudence
and endeavor of the present Lord Proprietary, brought to great Perfection; and as
his Dominion there is absolute (as may appear by the Charter aforemention’d) so
all Patents, Warrants, Writs, Licenses, Actions Criminal, <i>&amp;c.</i> Issue forth there in
his Name: Wars, Peace, Courts, Offices, <i>&amp;c.</i> all in his Name made, held, and appointed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Laws are there Enacted by him, with the advice and consent of the General Assembly,
which consists of two Estates, namely, the first is made up by the Chancellor,
Secretary, and others of his Lordships Privy-Council, and such Lords of
Mannors, and others as shall be call’d by particular Writs for that purpose, to be
Issu’d by his Lordship: The second Estate consists of the Deputies and Delegates
of the respective Counties of the said Province, elected and chosen by the free voice
and approbation of the Free-men of the laid respective Counties.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Names of the Governor and Council in this present Year 1671. are as followeth,
Mr. <i>Charles Calvert</i>, his Lordships Son and Heir, Governor; Mr. <i>Philip Calvert</i>,
his Lordships Brother, Chancellor; Sir <i>William Talbot</i> Baronet, his Lordships
Nephew, Secretary; Mr. <i>William Calvert</i>, his Lordships Nephew, Muster-Master-General;
Mr. <i>Jerome White</i>, Surveyor-General; Mr. <i>Baker Brooke</i>, his Lordships Nephew;
Mr. <i>Edward Lloyd</i>, Mr. <i>Henry Coursey</i>, Mr. <i>Thomas Trueman</i>, Major <i>Edward
Fits-Herbert</i>, <i>Samuel Chew Esq.</i></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>His Lordship, or his Lieutenant there for the time being, upon due occasion,
Convenes, Prorogues, and Dissolves this Assembly; but whatsoever is by his
Lordships Lieutenant there, with the consent of both the said Estates Enacted, is
there of the same Force and Nature as an Act of Parliament is in <i>England</i>, until his
Lordship declares his dis-assent; but such Laws as his Lordship doth assent unto,
are not afterwards to be Alter’d or Repeal’d but by his Lordship, with the consent
of both the said Estates.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their chief Court of Judicature is held at St. <i>Maries</i> Quarterly every Year, to
which all Persons concern’d resort for Justice, and is call’d <i>The Provincial Court</i>,
whereof the Governor and Council are Judges: To the Court there doth belong several
sworn Attorneys, who constantly are present there, and act both as Barristers
and Attorneys; there are likewise chief Clerks, Bayliffs, and other Officers, which
duly attend the Court in their respective places.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Province is divided at present, so far as it is inhabited by <i>English</i>, into
Counties, whereof there be ten, <i>viz.</i> St. <i>Maries</i>, <i>Charles</i>, <i>Calvert</i>, <i>Anne Arandel</i>, and
<i>Baltemore</i> Counties, which first five lie on the West side of the Bay of <i>Chesapeack</i>; on
the Eastern side whereof, commonly call’d <i>The Eastern-Shore</i>, lies <i>Sommerset</i>, <i>Dorchester</i>,
<i>Talbot</i>, <i>Cæcil</i>, and <i>Kent Counties</i>, which last is an Island lying near the Eastern-shore
of the said Bay.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides the Provincial Court aforenam’d, there are other inferior Courts, appointed
to be held in every one of the Counties six times in the year, for the dispatch
of all Causes, not relating to Life or Member, and not exceeding the value
of three thousand weight of Tobacco; the decision of all other Causes being reserv’d
to the Provincial or higher Court before-mention’d, and there lies Appeals
from the County-Courts, to the Provincial Court.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, and other Officers appointed by the
Lord and Proprietary, or his Lordships Lieutenant for the time being, in the said
respective Counties; and without four Justices, of which one to be of the <i>Quorum</i>,
none of the said respective County-Courts can be held; any of his Lordships Privy
Council may sit as Judge, in any of the said County-Courts, by vertue of his
place.</p>

<p class='c010'>These Courts are appointed to be held at convenient Houses in the said Counties,
which commonly are not far distant from some Inn, or other House of Entertainment,
for accommodation of Strangers; one of the said six County Courts in
each County is held for settling of Widows and Orphans Estates.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are Foundations laid of Towns, more or less in each County, according
to his Lordships Proclamation, to that effect Issu’d forth in the year 1668. In <i>Calvert
County</i>, about the River of <i>Patuxent</i>, and the adjacent Cliffs, are the Bounds of
three Towns laid out, one over against <i>Point Patience</i>, call’d <i>Harvy Town</i>, another in
<i>Battel-Creek</i>, call’d <i>Calverton</i>, and a third upon the Cliffs, call’d <i>Herrington</i>, and Houses
already built in them, all uniform, and pleasant with Streets, and Keys on the
Water side. In the County of St. <i>Maries</i>, on the East side of St. <i>Georges</i> River, is the
principal and original Seat of this Province, where the general Assembly, and Provincial
Courts are held, and is call’d St. <i>Maries</i>, being erected into a City by that
Name, where divers Houses are already built: The Governor hath a House there
call’d St. <i>John</i>’s; the Chancellor Mr. <i>Philip Calvert</i>, his Lordships Brother, hath another,
and in this place is built and kept the Secretaries Office, where all the Records
are kept, all Process, Grants, for Lands, Probates of Wills, Letters of Administration
are issu’d out: the Plat of a Fort and Prison is lately laid there, upon a
point of Land, term’d <i>Windmil-Point</i>, from a Windmil which formerly stood there,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>the situation is proper, for that it commands the breadth of the said River of Saint
<i>Georges</i>; so that when it is finish’d, all Shipping may safely Ride before the Town,
without the least fear of any sudden Assault, or Attempt of Pirats or other Enemy
whatsoever. This City has formerly been the usual place of abode for his Lordships
Lieutenants, and their Retinue; but of late years the present Governor,
Mr. <i>Charles Calvert</i>, hath built himself a fair House of Brick and Timber, with all
Out-houses, and other Offices thereto belonging, at a place call’d <i>Mattapany</i>, near the
River of <i>Patuxent</i> before-mention’d, where he and his Family reside, being a pleasant,
healthful, and commodious Seat, about eight Miles by Land distant from St. <i>Maries</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of the <i>Indians</i> in <i>Mary-land</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Indians</i> in <i>Mary-land</i> are a People generally of streight, able, and well proportion’d
Bodies, something exceeding the ordinary pitch of the <i>English</i>, their Complexion
Swarthy, their Hair naturally long and black, without Curle, which generally
they cut after some strange Fantastical Mode; nay, sometimes they Dye
it with red and other preposterous Colours: They Liquor their Skins with Bears
Grease, and other Oyls, which renders them more tawny, and less apt to receive
injury from the Weather: They are subtile from their Infancy, and prone to learn
any thing their Fancy inclines them to, in other things slothful.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are as many distinct Nations among them as there are <i>Indian</i> Towns,
(which are like Countrey-Villages in <i>England</i>, but not so good Houses) dispers’d
throughout the Province: Each Town hath its King (by them term’d <i>Werowance</i>)
and every forty or fifty Miles distance differs much from its Neighbors in Speech
and Disposition: The <i>Sasquahanocks</i>, though but few in number, yet much exceed
the rest in Valor, and Fidelity to the <i>English</i>; the rest being generally of a more
Treacherous Spirit, and not so stout, and the number of the <i>English</i> do already exceed
all the <i>Indians</i> in the Province.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Werowance</i> is assisted by Councellors, call’d <i>Wisoes</i>, who are commonly of
the same Family, and are chosen at the pleasure of the <i>Werowance</i>: They have Captains
in time of War which they term <i>Cockorooses</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Most of their Governments are Monarchical, (except the <i>Sasquahanocks</i>, which is
a Re-publick) but for succession they have a peculiar Custom, that the Issue of the
Males never succeed, but the Issue-Male of the Female succeed in Government, as
the surer side: They all submit to, and are protected by the Lord Proprietaries
Government; and in case of any Assault or Murder, committed on any <i>English</i>, the
Party offending is try’d by the Laws of the Province; and in case of any new Election
of King or Emperor among them, they present the Person so Elected to the
Governor for the time being, who as he sees cause, either alters or confirms their
Choice.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1663. at the <i>Indians</i> Request, the present Governor Mr. <i>Charles Calvert</i>,
and some others of his Lordships Privy-Council there, went to <i>Pascatoway</i>, in this
Province, to be present at the Election of a new Emperor for that Nation: They
presented a Youth nam’d <i>Nattawasso</i>, and humbly Requested to have him confirm’d
Emperor of <i>Pascatoway</i>, by the Name of <i>Wahocasso</i>; which after some charge given
them in general, to be good and faithful Subjects to him, the Governor accordingly
did, and receiv’d him into his Protection.</p>

<p class='c010'>They pay great Respect and Obedience to their Kings and Superiors, whose
Commands they immediately Execute, though with an apparent hazard of their
Lives.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Mens chief employment is Hunting, and the Wars, in both which they
commonly use Bowes and Arrows; some of late have Guns and other Weapons,
by a private Trade with some <i>English</i> Neighboring Plantations: They are excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Marks-men, it being the onely thing they breed their Youth to: The Women
Plant and look after the Corn, make their Bread, and dress what Provisions their
Husbands bring home. Their way of Marriage is by agreement with the Womens
Parents or Friends, who for a certain Sum of their Money, or other Goods, deliver
her to the Man at a day appointed, which is commonly spent in jollity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Money.</div>

<p class='c010'>There are two sorts of <i>Indian</i> Money, <i>Wampompeage</i> and <i>Roanoack</i>, these serve
among them as Gold and Silver do in <i>Europe</i>, both are made of Fish-shells, which
they string like Beads; <i>Wampompeage</i> is the largest Bead, sixty whereof countervails
an Arms length of <i>Roanoack</i>, which is valued at six Pence <i>Sterling</i>; with this they
purchase Commodities of the <i>English</i>, as Trading-Cloth, <i>&amp;c.</i> of which they make
themselves Mantles, which is something shaggy, and is call’d <i>Dutch Duffels</i>; this
is their Winter Habit; in Summer they onely wear a narrow slip of the same to
cover those parts, which natural modesty teaches them to conceal; the better
sort have Stockings made thereof, and pieces of Deer-Skin, stitch’d together about
their Feet in stead of Shooes: The Womens Apparel is the same, but those of the
best Quality among them bedeck themselves with <i>Wampompeage</i> or <i>Roanoack</i>, or some
other toy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Manner of habitation.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Houses are rais’d about the height of a large Arbor, and cover’d with
Barks of Trees very tite, in the middle whereof is the Fire-place, they lie generally
upon Mats of their own making, plac’d round the Fire, a Woodden-bowl or two,
an Earthen Pot, and a Mortar and Pestle, is their chiefest Houshold-stuff; he that
hath his Bowe and Arrows, or Gun, a Hatchet, and a <i>Canoo</i>, (a term they use for
Boats) is in their minds rarely well provided for; each House contains a distinct
Family, each Family hath its peculiar Field about the Town, where they Plant their
Corn, and other sorts of Grain afore-mention’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Civility to the <i>English</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>They are courteous to the <i>English</i>, if they chance to see any of them coming towards
their Houses, they immediately meet him half-way, conduct him in, and
bid him welcome with the best Cates they have: The <i>English</i> giving them in like
manner civil Entertainment, according to their Quality.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Werowance</i> of <i>Patuxent</i> having been Treated for some days at St. <i>Maries</i>, by
the then Governor, Mr. <i>Leonard Calvert</i>, his Lordships Brother, at his first coming
thither to settle that Colony, took his leave of him with this Expression, <i>I love the</i>
English <i>so well, that if they should go about to kill me, if I had so much breath as to speak, I
would Command my People not to revenge my death; for I know they would not do such a thing,
except it were through my own default.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>In Affairs of concern, they are very considerate, and use few words in declaring
their intentions; for at Mr. <i>Leonard Calverts</i> first arrival there, the <i>Werowance</i> of <i>Pascatoway</i>
being ask’d by him, <i>Whether he would be content, that the</i> English <i>should sit down
in his Countrey?</i> return’d this answer, <i>That he would not bid him go, neither would he bid
him stay, but that he might use his own discretion.</i> These were their expressions to the
Governor at his first entrance into <i>Mary-land</i>, whom then they were jealous of,
whether he might prove a Friend or a Neighbor, but by his discreet Demeanor towards
them at first, and friendly usage of them afterwards, they are now become, not
only civil, but serviceable to the <i>English</i> there upon all occasions.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Indians</i> of the Eastern shore are most numerous, and were formerly very refractory,
whom Mr. <i>Leonard Calvert</i> some few years after his first settling the Colony,
was forc’d to reduce, and of late the Emperor of <i>Nanticoke</i>, and his Men were
deservedly defeated by the present Governor, Mr. <i>Charles Calvert</i>, who reduc’d him
about the year 1668. which has since tam’d the ruder sort of the neighboring <i>Indians</i>,
who now by experience, find it better to submit and be protected by the Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Proprietaries Government, than to make any vain attempt against his Power.</p>

<p class='c010'>These People live under no Law, but that of Nature and Reason, which notwithstanding
leads them to the acknowledgement of a Deity, whom they own to
be the Giver of all good things, wherewith their Life is maintain’d, and to him
they Sacrifice the first Fruits of the Earth, and of that which they acquire by Hunting
and Fishing: The Sacrifice is perform’d by their Priests, who are commonly
ancient Men, and profess themselves Conjurers; they first make a Speech to their
God, then burn part, and eat and distribute the rest among them that are present;
until this Ceremony be ended, they will not touch one bit thereof; they hold the
Immortality of the Soul, and that there is a place of Joy, and another of Torment
after Death, prepar’d for every one according to their Merits.</p>

<p class='c010'>They bury their Dead with strange expressions of Sorrow (the better sort upon
a Scaffold, erected for that end) whom they leave cover’d with Mats, and return
when his flesh is consum’d to Interr his Bones; the common sort are committed to
the Earth without that Ceremony; but they never omit to bury some part of their
Wealth, Arms, and Houshold-stuff with the Corps.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Situation of <i>Virginia</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>First Discovery.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The most Southerly part of <i>Virginia</i> (for all that Tract of Land, reaching
from <i>Norumbega</i> to <i>Florida</i>, and containing <i>New-England</i>, <i>New-York</i>, <i>Mary-land</i>,
and this part we are now about to Treat of, was by Sir <i>Walter Rawleigh</i>
term’d <i>Virginia</i>, in Honor of our Virgin-Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>) lies between <i>Mary-land</i>,
which it hath on the North, and <i>Carolina</i>, which it hath on the South, from
thirty six, to near thirty eight Degrees of Northern Latitude; and with the rest of
those Countries which were comprehended under the same Denomination, was by
the Encouragement, and at the Expence of the said Sir <i>Walter Rawleigh</i>, first Discover’d
(as some say) by Captain <i>Francis Drake</i>, for his many notable and bold Exploits,
afterwards Knighted by the Queen: But upon examination we find little
reason to ascribe the first Discovery thereof to Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>, whose chief performances,
from the time he first made himself Eminent at Sea, were against the
<i>Spaniards</i>, and for the most part in the <i>Spanish-Indies</i>; as his taking of <i>Nombre de Dios</i>,
and <i>Vinta Cruz</i>, with an infinite mass of Treasure; his taking of <i>Santo Domingo</i> in
<i>Hispaniola</i>, and of <i>Carthagena</i> in <i>Castella Anna</i>; and that which seems to have given
occasion of attributing to him the first Discovery of these parts, was his touching
upon the North part of the Isle of <i>California</i>, where being nobly Entertain’d by
<i>Hioh</i>, a King of that Countrey, and having a Surrendry thereof made to him,
in behalf of the Queen of <i>England</i>, he upon a Pillar erected, Inscrib’d the Arms of
<i>England</i>, with the Queens Name and his own, and call’d the place <i>Nova Albion</i>:
Certain indeed it is, that Sir <i>Walter Rawleigh</i> was the first Promoter of this Discovery;
for, after Mr. <i>Martin Forbisher</i> had been sent by Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> to search for
the North-West Passage, which was in the year 1576. and for which he also was
by the Queen advanc’d to Knight-hood, and nobly rewarded; and Sir <i>Humphrey
Gilbert</i> obtaining the Queens Letters Patents, for attempting a Plantation, had
reach’d <i>New-found-land</i> (though perishing in his return) he upon these Relations and
Inducements undertook by others (for his employments would not permit him to
go in Person) to gain Discoveries to the Southward; and accordingly in the year
of our Lord 1584. obtain’d a Commission from the Queen, to discover and Plant
new Lands in <i>America</i>, not actually possess’d by any <i>Christians</i>, who, with the assistance
of Sir <i>Richard Greenvil</i>, and others, provided two small Barques, under the
Command of Captain <i>Philip Amidas</i>, and Captain <i>Arthur Barlow</i>, who setting Sail
the 27. of <i>April</i>, fell the 2<sup>d</sup> of <i>July</i> following with the Coast of <i>Florida</i>, and made
Discovery of the Isle of <i>Wokokon</i>, <i>Roanoack</i>, and the Continent of <i>Wingandacoa</i>, which
they left; and arriving in <i>England</i> about the midst of <i>September</i> following, Her Majesty
upon the relation of their Discoveries, was pleas’d to call this Countrey
<i>Virginia</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span><i>April 9. 1585.</i> Sir <i>Richard Greenvil</i>, with seven Sail, and several Gentlemen, left
<i>Plymouth</i>; and on <i>May 26.</i> Anchor’d at <i>Wokokon</i>, but made their first Seat at <i>Roanoack</i>
on <i>August 17.</i> following, which lies in thirty six Degrees of Northerly Latitude, or
thereabouts, where they continu’d till <i>June 1586.</i> during which time they made
several Discoveries in the Continent and adjacent Islands; and being endanger’d
by the treachery of the Salvages, return’d for <i>England</i>, and Landed at <i>Portsmouth</i> on
<i>July 27.</i> following.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sir <i>Walter Rawleigh</i> and his Associates, in the year 1586. sent a Ship to relieve that
Colony, which had deserted the Countrey some while before, and were all return’d
for <i>England</i> as is before-mention’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some few days after they were gone, Sir <i>Richard Greenvil</i>, with three Ships, arriv’d
at the Plantation at <i>Roanoack</i>, which he found deserted, and leaving fifty Men
thereto keep Possession of that Countrey, return’d for <i>England</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The year following, Mr. <i>John White</i>, with three Ships, came to search for the
fifty <i>English</i> at <i>Roanoack</i>, but found them not, they having been set upon by the Natives,
and dispers’d so, as no News could be heard of them, and in their room left
a hundred and fifty more to continue that Plantation.</p>

<p class='c010'>In <i>August 1589.</i> Mr. <i>John White</i> went thither again, to search for the last Colony
which he had left there; but not finding them, return’d for <i>England</i> in <i>Septemb. 6.
1590.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>This ill Success made all further Discoveries to be laid aside, till Captain <i>Gosnol</i>
on <i>March 26. 1602.</i> set Sail from <i>Dartmouth</i>, and on <i>May 11.</i> following, made Land
at a place, where some <i>Biscaners</i>, as he guess’d by the Natives information, had
formerly fish’d, being about the Latitude of forty eight Degrees Northerly Latitude;
from hence putting to Sea, he made Discovery of an Island which he call’d <i>Marthas
Vineyard</i>, and shortly after of <i>Elizabeth</i>’s Isle, and so return’d for <i>England</i>, <i>June 18.</i>
following.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1603. the City of <i>Bristol</i> rais’d a Stock, and furnish’d out two
Barques for Discovery, under the Command of Captain <i>Martin Pring</i>, who about
<i>June 7.</i> fell with the North of <i>Virginia</i> in the three and fortieth Degree, found plenty
of good Fish, nam’d a place <i>Whitson-Bay</i>, and so return’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1605. the Right Honorable <i>Thomas Arundel</i> the first, Baron of <i>Warder</i>,
and Count of the <i>Roman</i> Empire, set out Captain <i>George Waymouth</i>, with twenty
nine Sea-men, and necessary Provisions, to make what Discoveries he could; who
by contrary Winds, fell Northward about one and forty Degrees and twenty Minutes
of Northerly Latitude, where they found plenty of good Fish; and Sailing
further, discover’d an Island, where they nam’d a Harbor, <i>Pentecost-Harbor</i>; and on
<i>July 18.</i> following, came back for <i>England</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1606. by the sollicitation of Captain <i>Gosnol</i>, and several Gentlemen,
a Commission was granted by King <i>James</i> of <i>Great Brittain</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> for establishing a
Council, to direct those new Discoveries; Captain <i>Newport</i> (a well practic’d Marriner)
was intrusted with the Transportation of the Adventurers in two Ships,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>and a Pinace, who on <i>Decemb. 19. 1606.</i> set Sail from <i>Black-wall</i>, and were by
Storm, contrary to expectation, cast upon the first Land, which they call’d <i>Cape
Henry</i>, at the Mouth of the Bay of <i>Chesapeack</i>, lying in thirty seven Degrees, or
thereabouts, of Northerly Latitude: Here their Orders were open’d and read, and
eight declar’d of the Council, and impower’d to chose a President for a year, who
with the Council should Govern that Colony: Till <i>May 13.</i> they sought a place
to Plant in, Mr. <i>Winkfield</i> was chose the first President, who caus’d a Fort to be
rais’d at <i>Powhatan</i>, now call’d <i>James-Town</i>: In <i>June</i> following, Captain <i>Newport</i> return’d
for <i>England</i>, leaving a hundred Men behind him; since which time they have
been sufficiently supply’d from <i>England</i>, and by the indefatigable Industry and Courage
of Captain <i>John Smith</i>, (one of the Council at that time, and afterward President
of the Colony) they made several Discoveries on the Eastern shore, and up to
the Head of the Bay of <i>Chesapeack</i>, and of the principal Rivers which fall into the
said Bay.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Virginia</i> being thus Discover’d and Planted, King <i>James</i> by his Letters Patent
bearing Date <i>April 10.</i> in the fourth year of his Reign, 1607. Granted Licence to
Sir <i>Thomas Gates</i>, Sir <i>George Summers</i>, and others, to divide themselves into two several
Colonies, for the more speedy Planting of that Countrey, then call’d <i>Virginia</i>,
between the Degrees of thirty four and forty five of North Latitude, that is to
say, taken in that large extent, mention’d in the beginning: The first Colony to
be undertaken by certain Knights, Gentlemen, and Merchants, in, and about the
City of <i>London</i>: The second to be undertaken, and advanc’d by certain Knights,
Gentlemen, and Merchants, and their Associates, in, or about the City of <i>Bristol</i>,
<i>Exon</i>, <i>Plymouth</i>, and other parts.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the first Colonies Request, in the seventh year of the same King, a second
Patent was Granted to several Noblemen and Gentlemen, (including Sir <i>Thomas
Gates</i>, and some of his former Fellow-Patentees) bearing Date <i>May 23. 1610.</i> whereby
they were made a Corporation, and Body Politique, and stil’d, <i>The Treasurer,
and Company of Adventurers and Planters of the City of</i> London, <i>for the first Colony of</i> Virginia:
And by this Patent, there was Granted to them, their Successors and Assigns,
two hundred Miles to the Southward, from a <i>Cape</i> of Land in <i>Virginia</i>, call’d
<i>Point Comfort</i>; and two hundred Miles to the Northward of the said <i>Cape</i>, along the
Sea-shore, and into the Land from Sea to Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>And on <i>March 12. 1612.</i> the said King, in the ninth year of his Reign, Grants
them a third Patent, of all Islands lying in the Sea, within two hundred Miles of
the Shore of that Tract of Land on the Continent, granted to them by the said former
Patent, <i>Jac. 7.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1615. Captain <i>Smith</i> procur’d by his Interest at Court, and the
King’s Favor, a Recommendation from His Majesty, and divers of the Nobility,
to all Cities and Corporations, to Adventure in a standing Lottery, which was
erected for the benefit of this Plantation, which was contriv’d in such a manner,
that of 100000. Pounds which was to be put in, 50000. onely, or one half was to
return to the Adventurers, according as the Prizes fell out; and the other half to
be dispos’d of for the Promotion of the Affairs of <i>Virginia</i>, in which, though it were
three years before it was fully accomplish’d, he had in the end no bad Success.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the eighteenth Year of the said King’s Reign, at the Request of the second
Colony, a Patent was Granted to several Noblemen and Gentlemen, of all that
Tract of Land lying in the parts of <i>America</i>, between the Degrees of forty and forty
eight of Northerly Latitude, and into the Land from Sea to Sea, which was
call’d by the Patent <i>New England in America</i>: For the better Government whereof,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>one Body-Politick and Corporate was thereby appointed and ordain’d in <i>Plymouth</i>,
consisting of the said Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others, to the number of forty
Persons, by the Name of <i>The Council establish’d at</i> Plymouth <i>in the County of</i> Devon, <i>for
the Planting, Ruling, Ordering, and Governing of</i> New England <i>in</i> America.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Patent of <i>Virginia</i> made void.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Miscarriages and Misdemeanors of the aforesaid Corporation for the first
Colony of <i>Virginia</i>, were so many and so great, that His said Majesty was forc’d,
in or about <i>October 1623.</i> to direct a <i>Quo Warranto</i>, for the calling in of that former
Patent, which in <i>Trinity</i> Term following was legally Evinc’d, Condemn’d, and
made Void, by Judgment in the Court of the then <i>Kings-Bench</i>; as also all other
Patents, by which the said Corporation claim’d any Interest in <i>Virginia</i>. Thus this
Corporation of the first Colony of <i>Virginia</i> was dissolv’d, and that Plantation
hath been since Govern’d and Dispos’d of by Persons Constituted and Impower’d
for that purpose from time to time, by immediate Commissions from the Kings of
<i>England</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Patent of <i>Mary-land</i> granted to the Lord <i>Baltemore</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the Year of our Lord 1631. the Right Honorable <i>George</i> Lord <i>Baltemore</i> obtain’d
a Grant of King <i>Charles</i> the First of <i>Great Britain</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> of part of that Land to
the Northward, which is now call’d <i>Mary-land</i>; but this Patent of <i>Mary-land</i> was
not perfected till 1632. as you may understand more fully by the precedent Discourse
of <i>Mary-land</i>, which by express words in the said Patent is separated from,
and thereby declar’d not to be reputed for the future, any part of <i>Virginia</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Patent <i>Carolina</i> granted to several Noble Persons.</div>

<p class='c010'>And in the fifteenth Year of the Reign of King <i>Charles</i> the Second of <i>Great Britain</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> on <i>March 24. 1663.</i> <i>Edward</i> Earl of <i>Clarendon</i>, then High-Chancellor of
<i>England</i>, <i>George</i> Duke of <i>Albemarle</i>, <i>William</i>, now Earl of <i>Craven</i>, <i>John</i> Lord <i>Berkley</i>,
<i>Anthony</i> Lord <i>Ashley</i>, Sir <i>George Carterett</i> Knight and Baronet, Sir <i>William Berkley</i>
Knight, and Sir <i>John Colleton</i> Knight and Baronet, obtain’d a Patent from His Majesty,
of the Province of <i>Carolina</i>, which lies to the Southward of <i>Virginia</i>, in which
is included some part of that Land which formerly belong’d to the said dissolv’d
Company of <i>Virginia</i>. So that <i>Virginia</i> at present extendeth it self onely, and is situated
between thirty six and thirty seven Degrees and fifty Minutes, or thereabouts,
of Northern Latitude, and is bounded on the North, by <i>Mary-land</i>; on the South,
by <i>Carolina</i>; on the East, by the Ocean; and on the West, by the South-Seas.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rivers of <i>Virginia</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Entrance by Sea into this Countrey is the same with that of <i>Mary-land</i>, between
<i>Cape Henry</i> and <i>Cape Charles</i>, plac’d on each side of the Mouth of the Bay of
<i>Chesapeak</i>; on the West side whereof you first meet with a pleasant and commodious
River call’d <i>James-River</i>, about three Miles wide at its Entrance, and Navigable
a hundred and fifty.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fourteen Miles from this River Northward lies <i>York-River</i>, which is Navigable
sixty or seventy Miles, but with Ketches and small Barques thirty or forty Miles
farther.</p>

<p class='c010'>Passing hence to the North you discover a third stately River, call’d <i>Rappahanock</i>,
which is Navigable about a hundred and thirty Miles—from whence following
the Shore to the North you enter into <i>Patomeck-River</i>, which is already describ’d in
the precedent Discourse of <i>Mary-land</i>, to which Province this River belongs, whose
Southerly Bank gives Bounds to that part of <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Mary-land</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>To these Rivers many other Inland Branches and Rivulets are reduc’d, the chief
of which are hereafter specifi’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nature of the Countrey.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey is generally even, the Soil fruitful, the Climate healthful, and
agreeable with <i>English</i> Constitutions, especially since the increase of Inhabitants,
and accommodation of good Diet and Lodging, which the first Planters found
great want of heretofore. For many years, till of late, most New-comers had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>first Year in <i>July</i> and <i>August</i>, a Disease which is call’d <i>A Seasoning</i>, whereof many
died, like to what is mention’d before in the Description of <i>Mary-land</i>, though
more mortal and common than in <i>Mary-land</i>, because <i>Virginia</i> is a lower Countrey,
and somewhat hotter, insomuch that formerly divers ill of that Distemper have
come purposely from <i>Virginia</i> to <i>Mary-land</i>, to recover their Health; but now, since
the Countrey is more open and clear from Wood, few die of it, and many have no
<i>Seasonings</i> at all.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey affordeth generally all such Roots, Herbs, Gums, and Balsoms,
as are express’d before in the Relation of <i>Mary-land</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Trees</div>

<p class='c010'>All sorts of Trees for Building and Husbandry, Fruit-Trees, Vines, <i>&amp;c.</i> are
found in both Countreys, equal in goodness and quantity, onely in such things as
require more Sun, and that may be produc’d by Industry, there may be some little
difference, because <i>Virginia</i> is somewhat more to the Southward of <i>Mary-land</i>, as in
Vines, Oranges, Lemmons, Olives, Silk, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Silk-Grass.</div>

<p class='c010'>There is a Plant grows naturally in this Countrey, and in <i>Mary-land</i>, call’d <i>Silk-Grass</i>,
which will make a fine Stuff with a silky Gloss, and better Cordage than
Hemp or Flax, both for strength and durance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fruits peculiar to <i>Virginia</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The wild Beasts, Birds, and Fish, are much the same also in this Countrey as are
before describ’d in the precedent Description of <i>Mary-land</i>: Nevertheless we shall
think it proper not to omit some Fruits, Plants, Beasts, <i>&amp;c.</i> mention’d by the most
authentick Describers of <i>New England</i>, as peculiar to that Countrey. The Fruits
are, their <i>Putchamines</i>, which are a kind of Damsons; <i>Messamines</i>, a kind of Grapes;
<i>Chechinquamins</i>, a sort of Fruit resembling a Chesnut; <i>Rawcomens</i>, a Fruit resembling
a Goose-berry; <i>Macoquer</i>, a kind of Apple; <i>Mettaquesunnauks</i>, a sort of Fruit resembling
<i>Indian</i> Figs; <i>Morococks</i>, resembling a Straw-berry, besides a Berry which they
call <i>Ocoughtanamnis</i>, somewhat like to Capers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Roots.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their peculiar Roots are <i>Tockawaugh</i>, good to eat; <i>Wichsacan</i>, of great vertue in
healing of Wounds; <i>Pocones</i>, good to asswage Swellings and Aches; <i>Musquaspen</i>,
wherewith they Paint their Targets and Mats. Also they have in great request a
Pulse call’d <i>Assentamen</i>, and the Plant <i>Mattouna</i>, of which they make Bread.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Beasts.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their peculiar Beasts are, the <i>Aroughena</i>, resembling a Badger; the <i>Assapanick</i> or
<i>Flying-Squerril</i>; <i>Opassum</i>, a certain Beast having a Bag under her Belly, wherein she
carrieth and suckleth her Young; <i>Mussascus</i>, which smelling strong of Musk, resembleth
a Water-Rat; <i>Utchunquois</i>, a kind of wild Cat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their peculiar Fish are <i>Stingrais</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rivulets.</div>

<p class='c010'>On the West side of the Bay of <i>Chesapeak</i>, between <i>Cape Henry</i> and the Southerly
Bank of the River of <i>Patomeck</i>, are three fair Navigable Rivers, as is before mention’d,
into which the other small Rivulets fall, which here we will give some account
of, as also of the <i>Indian</i>, or antient Names by which these three principal Rivers
were formerly known. The first whereof is <i>Powhatan</i> (now call’d <i>James-River</i>)
according to the Name of a large and considerable Territory that lieth upon it.
The Rivers that fall into this Southward, are <i>Apamatuck</i>; Eastward, <i>Quiyonycohanuc</i>,
<i>Nansamund</i>, and <i>Chesapeak</i>; and Northward, <i>Chickamahania</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second Navigable River is <i>Pamaunkee</i>, by the <i>English</i> now term’d <i>York-River</i>.
The Rivulet that falls into this is <i>Poyankatanck</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The third (which is before describ’d, and usually known by the Name of <i>Rappahanoc</i>)
was formerly term’d <i>Toppahanoc</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This we thought fit here to insert, to the end no colour of mistake might remain
to after Ages concerning the derivation or original change of such proper Names,
especially being Places of great advantage to the Colony.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Several People of the ancient natives of <i>Virginia</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>The chiefest of those Tribes or Divisions of People among the <i>Indians</i>,
that were by Name known to the <i>English</i> at their first arrival, were
upon the River <i>Pouhatan</i> the <i>Kecoughtans</i>, the <i>Paspaheges</i>, (on whose
Land is seated <i>James-Town</i>) the <i>Weanocks</i>, the <i>Arrohatocks</i>, the <i>Appametocks</i>,
the <i>Nansamunds</i>, the <i>Chesapeacks</i>, &amp;c. On the River <i>Pamaunkee</i>,

the <i>Manahoacks</i>, the <i>Moraghtacunds</i>, and the <i>Cuttatawomens</i>. On
the River <i>Patawomek</i>, the <i>Wighcocomocans</i>, the <i>Onawmanients</i>, and the
<i>Moyanances</i>. On the River <i>Pawtuxunt</i>, the <i>Acquintacsuacs</i>, the <i>Pawtuxunts</i>,
and the <i>Matapunients</i>. On the River <i>Bolus</i>, the <i>Sasquesahanoes</i>:
Southward from the Bay, the <i>Chawonocks</i>, the <i>Mangoacks</i>, the <i>Monacans</i>,
the <i>Mannahocks</i>, the <i>Masawomeks</i>, the <i>Atquanahucks</i>, and the <i>Kuscarawaocks</i>,
besides a number not material to be nam’d, as having had
little of Transaction that we hear of with the Planters.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Number of Inhabitants.</div>

<p class='c010'>The number of <i>English</i> Inhabitants in this Country are in this present
Year 1671. about thirty or forty thousand, who are plentifully
stock’d with all sorts of tame Cattel, as Cows, Sheep, Horses, Swine,
<i>&amp;c.</i> and all sorts of <i>English</i> Grain; great store of brave Orchards for
Fruit, whereof they make great quantities of Cyder and Perry.</p>

<p class='c010'>They have been much oblig’d by that worthy Gentleman Mr. <i>Edward
Digges</i>, Son of Sir <i>Dudley Digges</i>, who was Master of the Rolls,
and a Privy Councellor to King <i>Charles</i> the First, of <i>Great Britain</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
For the said Mr. <i>Digges</i> at his great Charge and Industry, hath very
much advanc’d the making of Silk in this Countrey, for which purpose
he hath sent for several Persons out of <i>Armenia</i> to teach them that
Art, and how to wind it off the Cods of the Silk-worms; and hath
made at his own Plantation in this Colony for some years last past,
considerable quantities of Silk, which is found to be as good Silk as any
is in the World, which hath encourag’d divers others to prosecute
that Work.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Commodities of <i>Virginia</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Though this Countrey be capable of producing many other good
Commodities, yet the Planters have hitherto imploy’d themselves for
the most part in Planting of Tobacco, as they do in <i>Mary-Land</i>;
whereof there are two sorts, one which is call’d <i>Sweet-scented</i>, and the
other call’d <i>Oranoack</i>, or <i>Bright and Large</i>, which is much more in
quantity, but of lesser price than the former; and the Plantations upon
<i>York River</i> are esteem’d to produce the best of that sort of <i>Sweet-scented</i>:
There is so much of this Commodity Planted in <i>Virginia</i>, and
Imported from thence into <i>England</i>, that the Custom and Excise paid
in <i>England</i> for it, yields the King about fifty or threescore thousand
Pounds <i>Sterling</i>, <i>per annum</i>: With this Commodity the Planters buy
of the Ships that come thither for it (which are above a hundred Sail
yearly from <i>England</i>, and other <i>English</i> Plantations) all Necessaries of
Clothing, and other Utensils of Houshold-stuff, <i>&amp;c.</i> which they want,
though they make some Shoes, and Linnen and Woollen Cloth in
some Parts of <i>Virginia</i>, of the growth and Manufacture of the Countrey;
and if they would Plant less Tobacco (as it is probable they will
e’re long find it convenient for them to do, it being now grown a Drug
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>of very low value, by reason of the vast quantities planted of it) they
might in time provide themselves all Necessaries of Livelyhood, and
produce richer and more Staple-Commodities for their Advantage.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their usual way of Trafique in buying and selling is by exchange of
one Commodity for another; and Tobacco is the general Standard, by
which all other Commodities receive their value; but they have some
<i>English</i> and foreign Coyns, which serve them upon many occasions.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Government is by a Governor and Council, Appointed and
Authoriz’d from time to time by immediate Commission from the
King of <i>Great Brittain</i>: And Laws are made by the Governor, with
the consent of a General Assembly, which consists of two Houses, an
Upper and a Lower; the first consists of the Council, and the latter of
the Burgesses chosen by the Freemen of the Countrey; and Laws so
made are in Force till His Majesty thinks fit to alter them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The chief Court of Judicature is call’d <i>The Quarter-Court</i>, because
it is held every quarter of a Year, where all Causes Criminal and Civil
are heard and determin’d, and the Judges of this Court are the Governor
and Council: The present Governor in this Year 1671. is Sir
<i>William Berkley</i>, who was made Governor by King <i>Charles</i> the First, of
<i>Great Brittain, &amp;c.</i> in the Year 1640. And those of the Council are
Sir <i>Henry Chichesly</i>, who is one of the greatest and most considerable
Planters there, and Mr. <i>Edward Diggs</i> before-mention’d, Mr. <i>Thomas
Ludwel</i> Secretary, Major-General <i>Robert Smith</i>, and divers other worthy
Gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c010'>That Part of the Country where the <i>English</i> are Planted, is divided
into nineteen Counties, <i>viz.</i> <i>Northampton-County</i> in <i>Acomack</i>, on the
Eastern shore; and on the Western shore, <i>Corotuck</i>, <i>Lower-Norfolk</i>,
<i>Nansemund</i>, <i>Isle of Wight</i>, <i>Surry</i>, <i>Warwick</i>, <i>Henerico</i>, <i>James</i>, <i>Charles</i>, <i>York</i>,
<i>New-Kent</i>, <i>Glocester</i>, <i>Middlesex</i>, <i>Lancaster</i>, <i>Northumberland</i>, <i>Westmoreland</i>,
<i>Rappahanock</i>, and <i>Harford-Counties</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In every one of these Counties there are inferior County-Courts
kept every Month; these take no Cognizance of Causes relating to
Life or Member, or exceeding a certain limited Value, such being refer’d
to the Quarter-Courts only, to which likewise there lie Appeals
from their Inferior Courts.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, and other Officers in every
respective County, appointed by the Governor, for the Administration
of Justice, who sit there according to his Order, and whereof these
County-Courts are chiefly compos’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are few Towns as yet erected in this Colony; the Principal
Seat of the <i>English</i> there, is at a Place call’d <i>James-City</i>, in Honor of
King <i>James</i> of <i>Great Brittain, &amp;c.</i> This is situated in a <i>Peninsula</i>, on
the North-side of <i>James River</i>, and has in it many fair Brick and other
good Houses: In this place are held the Quarter-Courts, General
Assemblies, the Secretaries Office, and all other Affairs and greatest
Concerns of the Colony are here dispatch’d. On the same side, nearer
the Mouth of this River, stands <i>Elizabeth-City</i>, containing also several
good Houses of Brick and Timber.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Sir <i>William Berkley</i>, the present Governor resides at a place somewhat
distant from <i>James-City</i>, call’d <i>Green-spring</i>, a fair Brick House, which
he himself caus’d to be Built.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other Towns of Note belonging to the <i>English</i>, are only <i>Henricopolis</i>,
or <i>Henry’s-Town</i> (so nam’d from Prince <i>Henry</i> then living, built
in a very convenient place, more within Land, about eighty Miles distant
from <i>James-City</i>) and <i>Dale’s-Gift</i>, so nam’d from Sir <i>Thomas Dale</i>
Deputy-Governor of the Countrey, about the Year 1610.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Indians</i> of <i>Virginia</i> far exceed those of <i>Mary-land</i>, in Treachery
and Cruelty to the <i>English</i> there, as will appear by this following Relation
of their Proceedings towards them, since the first Seating of that
Colony, wherein nevertheless, the Civility of some particular Persons
at their first Landing is not to be omitted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Transactions between the <i>English</i> and the Natives.</div>

<p class='c010'>Upon the first arrival of Captain <i>Amidas</i> and Captain <i>Barlow</i> in <i>Wingandacoa</i>,
now <i>Virginia</i>, they were accosted by <i>Granganimeo</i> (the King’s
Brother of that Countrey) who, attended with a Train of forty or fifty
Men, came in a very civil manner to Treat about a Commerce of
Trade and Traffique, which immediately began between them, and several
Barters were made: <i>Granganimeo</i>, who was very just of his word,
and always kept his promis’d Day of meeting, fancying most a Pewter
Dish, gave twenty Deer-skins for it, and boring a Hole therein,
hung it about his Neck for a Breast-plate; afterwards he, with his
whole Company, and his Wife and Children, frequently and familiarly
did eat and drink aboard the <i>English</i> Ships, the King himself call’d
<i>Wingina</i>, lying sick at his chief Town, six days Journy off, of a dangerous
Wound which he had receiv’d from a neighboring King his
mortal Enemy. Some of the <i>English</i> going to Land upon the Isle of
<i>Roanoack</i>, were met by <i>Granganimeo</i>’s Wife, who, her Husband being
absent, commanded her Servants some to draw their Boat ashore, some
to carry them on their Backs to Land, others to carry their Oars into
the House for fear of stealing; and having caus’d a great Fire to be
made to warm them, and to dry those that had been wet in their Voiage,
she afterwards entertain’d them with a plentiful Feast or Banquet
after that Country fashion; and when they took alarm at the coming
of two or three of her Men with Bows and Arrows, she caus’d the
Bows to be broken, and the Men to be beaten out of the House, besides
several other demonstrations of extraordinary civility; and when not
withstanding all this they could not be perswaded to Lodg any where
but in their Boat, she us’d all means imaginable to make them quit
their Jealousy, and accept of a Lodging in the House.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1585. a Company that went over with Sir <i>Richard Greenvil</i>,
burnt the Town of <i>Aquascogoc</i>, for a Silver Cup that was stoln by
some of the <i>Indians</i>, took Prisoner <i>Menatonon</i>, King of <i>Chawonoc</i>, who
gave Relation of a King about three days Journy off, who possess’d an
Island rich in Pearl, which was taken in a deep Water that inviron’d
it. Going towards the Countrey of the <i>Mangoacks</i> (among whom in
the Province of <i>Chaunis Temaotan</i>, they heard of a Mine of strange
Copper call’d <i>Wassador</i>, with <i>Skiko</i>, the King of <i>Chawonock</i>’s Son, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span><i>Manteo</i>, a faithful Salvage, for their Guide) they were treacherously
dealt with by <i>Wingina</i>, alias <i>Pemissapan</i> (for so, his Brother <i>Granganimeo</i>
being lately dead, he had alter’d his Name) who endeavor’d to
stir up a Confederacy of the <i>Chawonocks</i>, <i>Moratocks</i>, and <i>Mangoacks</i> against
them; yet by the urgent perswasions of <i>Ensenore</i> his Father,
the truest Friend the <i>English</i> had, after the death of <i>Granganimeo</i>, and
seeing them safe return’d from their Journey, wherein he thought they
had all perish’d, and especially upon <i>Menatonon</i>’s sending Messengers
to them with Pearl, and <i>Okisco</i> King of <i>Weopomeock</i>, to yield himself
Vassal to the Queen of <i>England</i>, his Hatred was somewhat cool’d; but
<i>Ensenore</i> deceasing soon after, he return’d to his old treacherous Practices
again, and in the end, while he was contriving Mischief against
the Planters, he himself was shot, taken Prisoner, and beheaded.</p>

<p class='c010'>After the Company left upon <i>Virginia</i> by Sir <i>Richard Greenvil</i>, (for
he himself was return’d) tir’d out with hunger, hardship, and the many
extremities they were at last reduc’d to, had deserted the Place, and
obtain’d passage for <i>England</i>, through the civility of Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>,
pitying their distress, fifty Men more were Landed upon <i>Roanoack-Isle</i>,
by the same Person, who how they were surpris’d and destroy’d by the
Natives, was discover’d at large to the Supply that was sent over in the
Year 1587. by Mr. <i>White</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>A small Party under Captain <i>Smith</i> going down the River to
<i>Keconghean</i>, were very fiercely assaulted by sixty or seventy <i>Indians</i>,
but their Musquet-shot did such Execution amongst them, that they
fled into the Woods and left behind them the Image of their God,
which had been carry’d before them as their Standard, and not long
after sent one of their <i>Queiongcasocks</i> to offer Peace, and to redeem their
<i>Okee</i>; which <i>Smith</i> granting, on condition six onely of them would
come unarm’d and load his Boat with Provisions; and promising more
over to become their Friend, and furnish them with Beads, Copper,
and Hatchets: They accepted the Condition, and brought him Venison,
Turkies, wild Fowl, Bread, and what else they had, Singing
and Dancing in sign of Friendship till they departed.</p>

<p class='c010'>In his next Voyage for the discovery of the Head of <i>Chickamahania</i>
River, he was, through the neglect of his Sea-men who were sent to
watch the Booty, taken Prisoner; in which condition he was kept a
whole Month: then being releas’d, he got Provisions for the People
in <i>James-Town</i>; which had they not timely receiv’d, they had all abandon’d
the Place, and return’d to <i>England</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>King <i>Powhatan</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>James-Town</i> burnt.</div>

<p class='c010'>While Affairs stood thus in a mean condition, Captain <i>Newport</i>
arriving there with a Ship and sixty Men to strengthen the Plantations,
he went to <i>Weromocomoco</i>, where King <i>Powhatan</i> kept his Court, and
found him sitting on a Bed of Mats, and an Embroider’d Leather Cushion,
Cloth’d in Deer-skins; at his Feet sat a young Maiden, and on
each side of the House twenty Concubines; his Head and Shoulders
painted red, and a Chain of white Beads about his Neck. <i>Newport</i> to
oblige him, gave him an <i>English</i> Youth; for which he receiv’d <i>Powhatans</i>
Friend <i>Mamontak</i>; with whom returning, he found a sad accident,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>for the Fire had not onely burnt the Houses of the new Planters, but also the Pallisado’s
about <i>James-Town</i>, made for a Defence against the Enemies Assaults, and
most of their Store; which was so much the worse, because it hapned in the
Winter, and indeed had prov’d very fatal, had not a Ship, which was suppos’d to
be lost, happily arriv’d there with a considerable quantity of Provisions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Smith</i>’s Voyage.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>His remarkable Exploits.</div>

<p class='c010'>Whilst the Town was rebuilding, <i>Smith</i> set Sail in an open Barque with fourteen
Men, and discover’d two Isles before <i>Point Charles</i>, to which he gave his Name;
then ran into the Inlet <i>Chesapeack</i>, in the midst of which lay several Islands, by the
Sea-men call’d <i>Russels</i>. Before the River <i>Wighcomoco</i> they found a disturbed Sea, and
more Northerly a Bay with fresh and hot Water, and at last he met with two <i>Virginians</i>,
which conducted the <i>English</i> along a Creek to <i>Onawmoment</i>, where some hundreds
of them lay in Ambuscade, according to <i>Powhatan</i>’s appointment, to cut off
<i>Smith</i>; who leaping forth on a sudden appear’d like Devils, all painted; but the
Bullets flying about made them all run away. <i>Smith</i>, whose Design was onely to discover
the Countrey, and the Silver Mine of <i>Patawomeck</i>, ten Leagues up into the
Countrey, found the Metal to be of little value, so that he return’d with little Success,
being newly cur’d of a poysonous Wound in the Arm, which was given him
by a Fish not unlike a Shark, whilst he lay aground near <i>Toppahanock</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>A while after being inform’d of <i>Powhatan</i>’s Design to destroy the <i>English</i>, (though
he had been lately Presented by <i>Newport</i> with a Silver Basin, a rich Chair, Bed, and
Furniture belonging to it, with other things of value) he, to prevent him, chose
forty eight out of two hundred Men which were Garrison’d in <i>James-Town</i>, then
going to <i>Werowocomoco</i>, Landed with much trouble, the River being frozen above
half a Mile from the Shore.</p>

<p class='c010'>A <i>German</i> Soldier amongst <i>Smith</i>’s Company giving private notice to <i>Powhatan</i>
of the Design of the <i>English</i>, made his Escape by flight: But <i>Smith</i> going on to
<i>Pamaunke</i>, found King <i>Opechancangough</i> with seven hundred Men in Arms, threatning
a fierce Battel; but <i>Smith</i> making directly up to him, set his Pistol on his
Breast, and forc’d him to lay down his Arms. <i>Powhatan</i> by this time provided
with Swords and Musquets by two <i>Dutch</i>-men, also began to bestir himself afresh;
but his Intentions being too soon known, he was again quieted, and forc’d a second
time to send <i>Smith</i> a String of Pearl; after which a Peace was concluded between
all the Natives and the <i>English</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many other Quarrels and Encounters there were in the Infancy of the Plantation
between the <i>Indians</i> and the <i>English</i>, wherein it would be endless to recount all
the Treacheries and Ambuscades of the Salvages, some of which had prov’d very
pernicious to the Planters, had they not been betray’d to Captain <i>Smith</i> by <i>Pocahonta</i>,
King <i>Powhatan</i>’s Daughter, who upon all occasions shew’d her self a great
Friend to the <i>English</i>, having sav’d the Captain’s Life, when, being her Father’s Prisoner,
he was just brought to Execution.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Lady was afterwards brought into <i>England</i>, Christned by the Name of
<i>Rebekah</i>, and Married to one Mr. <i>Rolf</i>, and died at <i>Gravesend</i> in an intended Voyage
back to her own Countrey.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nor did their Cruelties and Treacheries end when the Plantation came to be
more setled, for on the two and twentieth of <i>March</i> about the Year 1621. in the
time of Sir <i>Francis Wyat</i>’s Government, they generally combin’d to destroy all the
<i>English</i> there; and carried on this devilish Design with such dissimulation and dexterity,
that in one day they cut off seven hundred Men, Women, and Children,
there being at that time not above fifteen hundred in the Countrey.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since which time, in the Year of our Lord 1643. there hapned another bloody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>Massacre, wherein near five hundred <i>English</i> were in one Night miserably butcher’d
by those barbarous and perfidious Salvages: whose Blood the present Governor,
Sir <i>William Berkley</i>, nobly and justly reveng’d the Year following, utterly destroying
most of them, and taking Prisoner their chief Emperor, <i>Opichancono</i>, who died not
long after in Prison.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having given but a small hint, in its proper place, of the Story of Captain
<i>Smith</i>’s Imprisonment by <i>Powhatan</i>, and his deliverance from Death by <i>Pocahonta</i>;
we have thought not improper to reserve the Story of it, being very remarkable
for a particular Relation, before we conclude our Description of <i>Virginia</i>, since
otherwise we should have interrupted the Series of our former Discourse.</p>

<h4 id='c202' class='c013'><i>The Relation of Captain</i> Smith<i>’s being taken Prisoner by</i> Powhatan, <i>and of his being deliver’d from Death by his Daughter</i> Pocahonta.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>The Salvages having drawn from one <i>George Cassen</i>, whither Captain
<i>Smith</i> was gone, prosecuting that opportunity, they follow’d him with
three hundred Bowe-Men, conducted by the King of <i>Pamaunkee</i>, who
in divisions, searching the turnings of the River, found two of his Men by
the fire side, whom they shot full of Arrows, and flew. Then finding the
Captain, who, as is said, us’d the Salvage that was his Guide as his Shield,
(three of them being slain, and others sore gall’d) the rest would not come
near him: Thinking thus to have return’d to his Boat, regarding them as
he march’d, more than his way, he slipp’d up to the middle in an Osier-Creek,
and his Salvage with him, yet durst they not come to him, till being near dead
with cold, he threw away his Arms: Then according to their composition, they
drew him forth, and led him to the Fire, where his Men were slain; diligently
they chaf’d his benumm’d Limbs, he demanding for their Captain, they shew’d
him <i>Opechankanough</i>, King of <i>Pamaunkee</i>, to whom he gave a round Ivory double
compass Dyal. Much they marvel’d at the playing of the Fly and Needle, which
they could see so plainly, and yet not touch it, because of the Glass that cover’d
them; but when he demonstrated by that Globe-like Jewel, the roundness of the
Earth, and Skies; the Sphere of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and how the Sun did
chase the Night round about the World continually; the greatness of the Land
and Sea; the diversity of Nations, variety of Complexions, and how we were to
them <i>Antipodes</i>, and many other such like matters, they all stood as amaz’d with
admiration: Notwithstanding, within an hour after they ty’d him to a Tree, and
as many as could stand about him prepar’d to shoot him; but the King holding up
the Compass in his Hand, they all laid down their Bowes and Arrows, and in a
triumphant manner led him to <i>Orapaks</i>, where he was after their manner kindly
Feasted, and well us’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their order in conducting him was thus; Drawing themselves all in Fyle, the
King in the midst had all their Bowes and Swords borne before him. Captain
<i>Smith</i> was led after him by three great Salvages, holding him fast by each Arm;
and on each side six went in Fyle with their Arrows nocked. But arriving at the
Town (which was but onely thirty or forty Hunting Houses made of Mats, which
they remove as they please, as we our Tents) all the Women and Children staring
and gazing at him, the Souldiers first all in Fyle wheel’d off to the Rear in good
Order; on each Flank were Officers, like Serjeants to see them keep their Postures:
A good time they continu’d this Exercise, and then cast themselves in a Ring,
Dancing in such several Postures, and singing and yelling out such hellish Notes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>and Screeches; being strangely Painted, every one his Quiver of Arrows, and at
his Back a Club; on his Arm a Fox or an Otters-skin, or some such matter for his
vambrace; their Heads and Shoulders Painted red, with Oyl and <i>Pocones</i> mingled
together, which Scarlet-like colour, made an exceeding handsome show; his Bowe
in his Hand, and the Skin of a Bird with her Wings abroad dry’d, ty’d on his Head,
a piece of Copper, a white Shell, a long Feather, with a small Rattle growing at
the Tails of their Snaks ty’d to it, or some such like Toy. All this while <i>Smith</i> and
the King stood in the midst, guarded, as before is said, and after three Dances they
all departed. <i>Smith</i> they conducted to a long House, where thirty or forty tall Fellows
did guard him, and e’re long, more Bread and Venison was brought him
than would have serv’d twenty Men, I think his Stomack at that time was not very
good; what he left, they put in Baskets and ty’d over his Head. About midnight
they set the Meat again before him; all this time none of them would eat a
bit with him, till the next Morning they brought him as much more, and then
did they eat all the old, and reserv’d the new as they had done the other, which
made him think they would feed him for slaughter: Yet in this desperate estate to
fend him from the cold, one <i>Maocassater</i> brought him his Gown, in requital of some
Beads and Toys <i>Smith</i> had given him at his first arrival in <i>Virginia</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two days after a man would have slain him (but that the Guard prevented it)
for the death of his Son, to whom they conducted him to recover the poor man
then breathing his last. <i>Smith</i> told them, that at <i>James-Town</i> he had a Water would
do it, if they would let him fetch it, but they would not permit that; but made all
the preparations they could to assault <i>James-Town</i>, craving his advice, and for recompence
he should have Life, Liberty, Land, and Women. In part of a Tablebook
he writ his mind to them at the Fort, what was intended, how they should
follow that direction to affright the messengers, and without fail send him such
things as he writ for, and an Inventory with them. The difficulty and danger, he
told the Salvages, of the Mines, great Guns, and other Engines, exceedingly affrighted
them, yet according to his Request they went to <i>James-Town</i>, in as bitter
weather as could be of Frost and Snow, and within three days return’d with an Answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>But when they came to <i>James-Town</i>, seeing Men sally out as he had told them
they would, they fled; yet in the night they came again to the same place where
he had told them they should receive answer, and such things as he had promis’d
them, which they found accordingly, and with which they return’d with no small
expedition, to the wonder of them all, supposing that he could either Divine, or
the Paper could speak: then they led him to the <i>Youthtanunds</i>, the <i>Mattapanients</i>, the
<i>Payankatanks</i>, the <i>Nantaughtacunds</i>, and <i>Onawmanients</i> upon the Rivers of <i>Rapahanock</i>,
and <i>Patawomek</i>, through intricate ways, and back again by divers other several Nations,
to the Kings Habitation at <i>Pamaunkee</i>, where they entertain’d him with most
strange and fearful Conjurations. Not long after, early in the Morning, a great fire
was made in a long House, and a Mat spread on each side thereof; on the one
they caus’d him to sit, and all the Guard went out of the House, and presently
there came skipping in a great grim Fellow, all Painted over with Coal, mingled
with Oyl; and many Snakes and Wesels-skins stuff’d with Moss, and all their
Tails ty’d together, so as they met on the Crown of his Head in a Tassel; and
round about the Tassel was a Coronet of Feathers, the Skins hanging round
about his Head, Back, and Shoulders, and in a manner cover’d his Face; with a
hellish voice, and a Rattle in his Hand. With most strange gestures and passions
he began his Invocation, and environ’d the fire with a Circle of Meal; which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>done, three more such like Devils came rushing in with the like antique Tricks,
Painted half black, half red; but all their Eyes were Painted white, and some red
strokes like <i>Mutchato</i>’s, along their Cheeks: round about him those Fiends Danc’d
a pretty while, and then came in three more as ugly as the rest, with red Eyes, and
white strokes over their black Faces; at last they all sate down right against him,
three of them on the one hand of the chief Priest, and three on the other; then all
with their Rattles began a Song, which ended, the chief Priest laid down five
Wheat Corns, then stretching his Arms and Hands with such violence, that he
sweat, and his Veins swell’d, he began a short Oration: at the conclusion, they
all gave a short groan, and then laid down three Grains more; after that, began
their Song again, and then another Oration, ever laying down so many Corns as
before, till they had twice incircled the Fire; that done, they took a bunch of little
Sticks, prepared for that purpose, continuing still their Devotion, and at the
end of every Song and Oration, they laid down a Stick between the Divisions of
Corn: till night, neither he nor they did either eat or drink, and then they feasted
merrily, with the best Provisions they could make: Three days they us’d this
Ceremony, the meaning whereof they told him, was to know if he intended them
well, or no. The Circle of Meal signifi’d their Countrey, the Circles of Corn the
bounds of the Sea, and the Sticks his Countrey. They imagin’d the World to be
flat and round, like a Trencher, and they in the midst. After this they brought him
a Bag of Gun-powder, which they carefully preferv’d till the next Spring, to Plant
as they did their Corn, because they would be acquainted with the nature of that
Seed. <i>Opitchapam</i>, the King’s Brother, invited him to his House, where, with as many
Platters of Bread, Fowl, and wild Beasts, as did environ him, he bid him wellcome,
but not any of them would eat a bit with him, but put up all the remainder
in Baskets. At his return to <i>Opechancanoughs</i>, all the Kings Women, and their Children,
flock’d about him for their Parts, as a due by Custom, to be merry with such
Fragments.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last, they brought him to <i>Meronocomoco</i>, where was <i>Powhatan</i> their Emperor.
Here more than two hundred of those grim Courtiers stood wondering at him, as
he had been a Monster; till <i>Powhatan</i> and his Train had put themselves in their
greatest Braveries. Before a Fire, upon a seat like a Bedsted, he sat cover’d with a
great Robe, made of <i>Rarowcun</i>-Skins, and all the Tails hanging by. On either
hand did sit a young Maid, of sixteen or eighteen years of Age, and along on each
side the House, two rows of Men, and behind them as many Women, with all
their Heads and Shoulders Painted red; many of their Heads bedeck’d with the
white Doun of Birds, but every one with something, and a great Chain of white
Beads about their Necks. At his entrance before the Emperor, all the People gave a
great shout. The Queen of <i>Appamatuck</i> was appointed to bring him Water to wash
his Hands, and another brought him a bunch of Feathers, in stead of a Towel to
dry them: Having Feasted him after their barbarous manner as well as they could,
a long consultation was held, but in conclusion, two great Stones being brought
before <i>Powhatan</i>, as many as could, laid Hands on him, dragg’d him to them, and
thereon laid his Head, when being ready with their Clubs, to beat out his Brains,
<i>Pocahontas</i>, the Emperors dearest Daughter, seeing no intreaty could prevail, got his
Head in her Arms, and laid her own upon his to save him from death; whereat,
the Emperor was contented he should live to make him Hatchets, and her Bells,
Beads, and Copper; for they thought him a Man of all Occupations like themselves;
for the King himself will make his own Robes, Shoes, Bowes, Arrows,
Pots, Plant, Hunt, or do any thing as well as the rest.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Two days after, <i>Powhatan</i> having disguis’d himself in the most fearful manner
he could, caus’d Captain <i>Smith</i> to be brought forth to a great House in the Woods,
and there upon a Mat by the Fire to be left alone. Not long after, from behind a
Mat that divided the House, was made the most doleful noise he ever heard; then
<i>Powhatan</i>, more like a Devil than a Man, with about two hundred more as black as
himself, came unto him, and told him, That now they were Friends, and presently
he should go to <i>James-Town</i>, to send him two great Guns and a Grindstone, for
which he would give him the Countrey of <i>Capahowosick</i>, and for ever esteem him as
his Son <i>Nantaquoud</i>. So to <i>James-Town</i> with twelve Guides <i>Powhatan</i> sent him.
That Night they Quarter’d in the Woods, he still expecting (as he had done all
this long time of his Imprisonment) every hour to be put to one Death or other,
for all their Feasting: but Almighty God (by his Divine Providence) had mollifi’d
the Hearts of those stern <i>Barbarians</i> with compassion. The next Morning betimes
they came to the Fort, where <i>Smith</i> having us’d the Salvages with what kindness
he could, he shew’d <i>Rawhunt</i>, <i>Powhatan</i>’s trusty Servant, two Demi-Culverins
and a Milstone, to carry to <i>Powhatan</i>: they found them somewhat too heavy; but
when they saw him Discharge them, they being loaded with Stones, amongst the
Boughs of a great Tree loaded with Isickles, the Ice and Branches came so tumbling
down, that the poor Salvages ran away half dead with Fear. But at last we regain’d
some Conference with them, and gave them some Toys, and sent to <i>Powhatan</i>’s
Women and Children such Presents, as gave them in general, full content.</p>

<h4 id='c205' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. V.</span><br /> Carolina.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Description of <i>Carolina</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Carolina</i> is that part of <i>Florida</i> which lies between twenty nine and thirty six
Degrees and thirty Minutes of Northern Latitude: It is wash’d on the
East and South, with the <i>Atlantick</i> Ocean; on the West with <i>Mare Pacificum</i>,
or the South Sea; and on the North, bounds on <i>Virginia</i>. A Countrey wherein
Nature shews how bountiful she can be without the assistance of Art, the Inhabitants
(excepting a little <i>Maiz</i> which their old Men and Women Plant) depending
meerly on the natural and spontaneous Growth of the Soil for their Provisions,
the Woods furnishing them with store of Fruit and Venison, and the Rivers with
plenty of several sorts of wholsom and savory Fish.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Maintenance, which without forecast or toil they receive from the natural
fruitfulness of the Countrey, will, if we consider either the largeness of their
Growth, or the duration of their Lives, be thought neither scanty nor unhealthy,
their Stature being of a larger size than that of <i>English</i>-men, their Make strong and
well proportion’d, a crooked or mis-shapen Person being not to be found in the
whole Countrey; and (where the chance of War, which they are almost continually
engag’d in one against another in their little Governments, spares any of
them) they live to an incredible old age; so that when the <i>English</i> came there, they
found some of their Kings, who saw descend from them the sixth Generation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Productions of the Soil.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Soil is very rich and fertile, producing naturally Walnuts, Grapes (of
which the <i>English</i> who are there Planted have made very good Wine) Apricocks,
Bullys, with a multitude of others; besides the Woods also are full of very good
Peaches, and all the Season of the Year strew’d all over with Strawberries. Mulberry-Trees
are the common growth of the Woods; and to assure you they are the
natural Offspring of the Place, and grow to an incredible bigness, one whereof the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span><i>English</i> (who are new Planted at <i>Albemarle Point</i> on <i>Ashley</i> River) made use to fasten the
Gate of their Pallisado to, was so large, that all who came from thence say, they
never saw any Oak in <i>England</i> bigger, which is but the ordinary size of the Mulberry-Trees
of this Countrey, which is so sure an Argument of the richness of the
Soil, that the Inhabitants of <i>Virginia</i> enquiring of the Seamen who came from
thence, concerning the Quality and Product of the Countrey, when they were inform’d
of the large Mulberry-Trees it produc’d, were so well satisfi’d with it, that
they made no farther Enquiry. There are also other Trees, as Ash, Poplar, and
Bay, with several sorts unknown to us of <i>Europe</i>; but those which make it almost
all one general Forrest of large Timber-Trees, are Oak, both red and white, and
Cedar. There are also here and there large Groves of Pine-Trees, some a hundred
Foot high, which afford a better sort of Mast than are to be had either in <i>Mary-Land</i>
or <i>Norway</i>. These larger Trees weaving their luxuriant Branches into a close
Shade, suffer no Under-wood to grow between them, either by their Droppings,
or else the Heads of Deer which loosening all the tender Shoots, quite destroy it; so
that a great part of the Countrey is as it were a vast Forrest of fine Walks, free from
the heat of the Sun, or the incumbrance of Shrubs and Bushes, and so clear and open,
that a Man may easily ride a Hunting amongst the Trees, yielding a Prospect very
pleasant and surpassing. On the Skirts of these Woods grow lesser Trees and Shrubs
of several sorts; amongst them are sundry Dying Materials, which how well the
Inhabitants know how to make use of, appears in the Deer-Skins that the chief of
them wear, which are Painted, or rather Dy’d, with several lively Colours. But
amongst their Shrubs, one of most note and use is that whose Leaves make their
<i>Casini</i>, a Drink they frequently use, and affirm to be very advantageous for the preservation
of Health; which, by the description our <i>English</i> give of the size, colour,
and shape of the Leaf, the sort of Tree it grows on, and the taste, colour, and effects
of the Drink, which is nothing but the Decoction of the Leaf, seems to be the very
same with the <i>East-India TEE</i>, and by those who have seen and tasted both, affirm’d
to be no other, and may very probably be a spontaneous and native Plant
of this Place, since those who give us an account of it, tell us, that this so much
valu’d Leaf grows most plentifully in <i>Nanking</i>, a Province in <i>China</i> under the very
same Latitude, and very much agreeing in Soil and Situation with this of <i>Carolina</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>What Herbs else the Countrey produces, the <i>English</i> Enquirers (who by minding
their Plantations and Settlement there, have been taken off from such unprofitable
Actions) give us but little account, onely they say, that those Plats of Ground
which have been formerly clear’d off by the <i>Indians</i> for the Planting their Corn,
they found thick cover’d with three-leav’d Grass and Dazies, which the fertility of
the Soil thrusts forth, whenever the Natives remove their Tillage to some other
place, and leave the Earth to its own production; and in other parts they found
plenty of Garden Herbs growing wild. The low and Moorish Grounds are for
the most part overgrown with Sedge and Reeds, and such other Trash, which usually
incumbers rich and uncultivated Lands; those they call <i>Swamsas</i>, which with
a little Husbandry would prove very good Meadows. There are also some large
and pleasant <i>Savanas</i>, or grassy Plains.</p>

<p class='c010'>These are a part of the Trees and Plants best known to us, that Nature of her
self produces, in a Soil which contrives and nourishes any thing. The <i>English</i> who
are now Planted in the most Northern parts of it, at <i>Albemarle</i>, bordering on <i>Virginia</i>,
have Apples, Pears, Cherries, Apricocks, Plumbs, and Water-Melons, equalling,
and if you will believe the Inhabitants, both in largeness of size and goodness
of taste, exceeding any in <i>Europe</i>. And they who are Setled farther South on <i>Ashley</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>River, have found that the Oranges, Lemmons, Pomegranates, Limes, Pomecitrons,
<i>&amp;c.</i> which they Planted there, have thriven beyond expectation; and
there is nothing which they have put into the Earth, that through any defect in the
Soil, hath fail’d to prosper.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Commodities of the Countrey.</div>

<p class='c010'>Besides those things which do serve to satisfie Hunger, or provoke it, the Land
doth with great return produce Indigo, Ginger, Tobacco, Cotton, and other Commodities
fit to send abroad and furnish foreign Markets; and when a little time
shall have brought those kind of Plants to maturity, and given the Inhabitants
leisure to furnish themselves with Conveniences for ordering those things aright,
the Trials that they have already made of the Soil and its fitness for such Plantations,
assure you, that besides Silk, enough to store <i>Europe</i>, and a great many
other considerable Commodities, they shall have as great plenty of good Wine
and Oyl, as any part of the World.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Mould is generally black, mellow, and upon handling feels soft, and (to
use their Expression who have been there) soapy, and is generally all over the
Countrey just like the fine Mould of our well order’d Gardens. Under this black
Earth, which is of a good thickness in most places that they have try’d, there lies a
Bed of Marle, and in some parts Clay.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fish and Water-Fowl.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Rivers are stor’d with plenty of excellent Fish of several sorts, which are taken
with great ease in abundance, and are one great part of the Natives Provision,
who are never like to want this Recruit, in a Countrey so abounding in large Rivers,
there being in that one small Tract between <i>Port Rasal</i> and <i>Cape Carteret</i>,
which are not one Degree distant, five or six great Navigable Rivers, that empty
themselves into the Sea. These Rivers are also cover’d with Flocks of Ducks and
Mallard, whereof millions are seen together, besides Cranes, Herons, Geese, Curlews,
and other Water-Fowl, who are so easie to be kill’d, that onely rising at the
discharge and noise of a Gun, they instantly light again in the same place, and presently
offer a fresh Mark to the Fowler. At the Mouths of the Rivers, and along
the Sea-Coast, are Beds of Oysters, which are of a longer Make than those in <i>Europe</i>,
but very well tasted, wherein are often found good large Pearls, which though the
unskilful <i>Indians</i> by washing the Oysters do commonly discolour, and spoil their
lustre, yet ’tis not to be doubted, but if rightly order’d, there will be found many
of value, and the Fishing for them turn to some account.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides the easie Provisions which the Rivers and Sea afford, their Woods are
well stock’d with Deer, Rabbets, Hares, Turtle-Doves, Phesants, Partridges, and
an infinite number of Wood-Pigeons and wild Turkies, which are the ordinary
Dishes of the <i>Indians</i>, whose House-keeping depends on their Fishing and Hunting,
and who have found it no ill way of Living in so fertile a Countrey, to trust themselves
without any labor or forecast, to the Supplies which are there provided to
their hands, without the continual trouble of Tillage and Husbandry. Besides,
these Woods are fill’d with innumerable variety of smaller Birds, as different in
their Notes as Kinds.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Temperature of the Climate.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Temperature of this Province is agreeable to a Countrey, whose Position
is on the warmer side of the temperate <i>Zone</i>, but yet the Heat is not so sultry nor
offensive, as in Places under the same Latitude in the <i>Old World</i>; to which moderation
of Heat, as well as the healthiness of it, the vast <i>Atlantick</i> Ocean, lying to the
East and South of it, may perhaps not a little contribute, an instance whereof
some think <i>China</i> to be; to which deservedly admir’d Countrey <i>Carolina</i> exactly answers
in its Position and Latitude, the trending from North-East to South-West
of its Coast, and the lowness of its Shore, and wants nothing but Inhabitants, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>make it equal, if not excell, in all conveniences of Life, as it doth in richness of
Soil, that flourishing Empire. The healthiness of the Air is such, that it is not
onely benign and favorable to the home-bred <i>Indians</i>, and Constitutions accustom’d
to it, but the <i>English</i>-men who first Planted on <i>Ashley</i> River, though for some other
Conveniences they Planted on the side, or almost middle of a Morass, and were encompass’d
with a salt Marsh, where the Air, pent up with Woods that surrounded
them, had not that freedom it hath in open and cultivated Countreys, yet lost not
in a whole years time, of a considerable number, any one Person, of any Disease to
be imputed to the Countrey, those few that dy’d in that time sinking under lingring
Distempers which they brought with them, and had almost worn them out
before they came thither. The <i>Bermudians</i> (who being accustom’d to the pure Air
of their own Island, cannot without hazard of their Lives put themselves into any
other Place) assur’d of the healthiness of this Place, which is the next Land to
them, and under the same Latitude, venture hither. And generally all the <i>English</i>
Planting in the <i>West-Indies</i>, are so taken with the Conveniences of this Countrey,
which, as some of the most considerable of the <i>English</i> in those Parts say of it, promises
all that the Heart of Man can wish, that they send the overplus of their People
hither; to which the Inhabitants of <i>Barbados</i>, a skilful and wary sort of Planters,
well knowing in all the parts of the <i>West-Indies</i>, have been found to remove the
Hands they could spare. As the Summer is not intolerably nor offensively hot, so
the Winter is not troublesom nor pinching, but enough to correct the Humors of
Mens Bodies, the better to strengthen them, and preserve their Healths, and so far
to check the growth of Plants, that by this stop they may put out more regularly,
and the Corn and other Fruits the better ripen together, and be ready seasonably at
the Harvest, the want whereof in some Countreys hinders the beneficial Growth
of several valuable Commodities, the continual Spring all the year long making that
their Crops are never ready, their Trees being laden with green and ripe Fruit at
the same time, which is to be seen in the Vines growing between the <i>Tropicks</i>,
where, though they bear excellent Grapes, yet they cannot make any Wine, whilest
the mixture of ripe and sowre Grapes upon the same Branch, renders them unfit for
the Press, which from Grapes so blended, though of a good kind, would squeeze
out a very crude and useless Liquor. This also is the reason why many Parts
where our Wheat will grow very well, do yet lose the benefit of it, whilest the several
Ears ripening unequally, never make the Crop fit for the Sickle. But this
Countrey hath Winter enough to remove that Inconvenience, and to put such a stop
to the Rise of the Sap, and the Budding of Plants, as to make the several kinds of
Fruits Bud and Blossom in their distinct Seasons, and keep even pace till they are
fit to be gather’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nature, Constitutions, and Manners of the Inhabitants.</div>

<p class='c010'>To this happy Climate the native Inhabitants are very well suited, a strong,
lusty, and well shap’d People, who to their well knit and active Bodies, want not
stout and vigorous Minds; they are a People of a good Understanding, well Humor’d,
and generally so just and Honest, that they may seem to have no notice of,
as their Language hath no word for, Dishonesty and Cheating; and the worst
Name they have for ill Men is, that they are not good. They are a stout and valiant
People, which appears in the constant Wars they are engag’d in, not out of
covetousness, and a desire of usurping others Possessions, or to enrich themselves by
the Spoils of their Neighbors, but upon a pitch of Honor, and for the glory of Victory,
which is their greatest joy, there being no parts of their Lives wherein they
enjoy so much satisfaction, and give themselves so wholly to Jollity, as in their
Triumphs after Victory. Valor therefore is the Vertue they most esteem and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>reward, and he which hath behav’d himself well in the Wars, is suffer’d to wear
the Badges of Honor, and is advanc’d beyond others with some Marks of his
Courage; which amongst some is blacking the Skin below his Eyes with black
Lead, in fashion something of an Half-Moon; which Mark of Courage is not suffer’d
to be worn by any, but those who by some brave Action, as killing the Enemy’s
Leader, <i>&amp;c.</i> hath signaliz’d himself in their Encounters. They are faithful to
their Promises, fair and candid in their Dealings, and so far from Dishonesty, that
they want even the Seeds of it, <i>viz.</i> Forecast and Covetousness; and he will be
very little apt to deceive you to Day, who troubles not himself much about to
Morrow, and trusts for the Provisions of the Day to the Day it self; which proceeds
not in them for want of Wit, but desire of Content and Quiet, or by the help
of their natural Reason they enjoy that Happiness which the Philosophers could
not by their Study and Reading attain to, whilest these Men cut off those Desires
which Learning could never help the other to Govern; and which if once permitted
to run out beyond the present, are capable of no Rest nor Bounds. In their
Conversation they are courteous and civil, and in their Visits make Presents to one
another; when they meet, their way of Salutation is stroaking on the Shoulders,
and sucking in their Breath; and if he be a great Man whom they Salute, they
stroak his Thighs too; as civil an Address, as those Patterns of good Breeding, the
Hero’s, us’d to their Princes, who in their greatest Courtships, we are told, embrac’d
their Knees: After their Salutation they sit down; and it is usual with
them to sit still almost a quarter of an hour before they speak, which is not an effect
of stupidity or sullenness, but the accustom’d Gravity of their Countrey; for they
are in their Tempers a merry, frollick, gay People, and so given to Jollity, that
they will Dance whole Nights together, the Women sitting by and Singing, whilest
the Men Dance to their Ayrs, which though not like ours, are not harsh or unpleasing,
but are something like the Tunes of the <i>Irish</i>: So that if we will not let our
selves too fondly admire onely the Customs we have been bred up in, nor think
Men are to be valu’d for making Legs after our Mode, or the Clothes they wear,
which, the finer and gayer they are, always the more to be suspected of Luxury and
Effeminateness; if we will allow but these Men to follow the Garbs of their own
Countrey, and think them fine enough in a shape onely to hide their Nakedness
before, or a Deer-skin hanging loosely on their Shoulders, and their Women not
ill Dress’d in Garments of Moss, and Necklaces of Beads, whilest the Fashion of
their Courts require no other Ornaments; if, I say, a long and pleasant Life,
without Distemper or Care, be to be valu’d, without the incumbrance of unnecessary
Trinkets; if Men are to be esteem’d for Valor, Honesty, Friendship, Humanity
and good Nature, though Strangers to the ceremonious Troubles we are
accustom’d to, the Natives of <i>Carolina</i> will as little, or perhaps less, deserve the
Name of <i>Miserable</i>, or <i>Salvage</i>, as those that give it them. ’Tis true, the <i>French</i> and
<i>Spaniards</i> who have Planted amongst them, or with little Armies travell’d their
Countrey, have been ill handled by them; but yet the <i>Indians</i> never did them any
harm, or treated them otherwise than Friends, till those <i>Europeans</i> by their breach of
Faith and several Outrages, had provok’d their just Revenge; and they did nothing
but what most virtuous and generous sort of Men are apt to do, to revenge those
Affronts, which did not agree with their Tempers tamely to endure. That
this did not proceed from treachery and inconstancy in their Natures, is apparent
in the contrary Correspondence they have had with the <i>English</i> Setled amongst
them, to whom they have been all along very kind, as they were at first very covetous
of their Company; for after that some of their King’s Relation had been at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span><i>Barbados</i>, and had seen and admir’d the Temper, Fashions and Strength of the
<i>English</i> there, and had been very civilly Treated in that Island, they were so well
satisfi’d with them, that at the coming of the <i>English</i> to Settle there, the several little
Kingdoms strove with all the Arts and Arguments they could use, each of them to
draw the <i>English</i> to Plant in their Dominions, by commending the richness of their
Soil, conveniency of their Rivers, the healthiness of their Countrey, the disparagement
of their Neighbors, and whatever else they judg’d might allure the <i>English</i> to
their Neighborhood. Nor was this onely the first heat of Men fond of Novelties,
and as soon weary of them again, but ever since the <i>English</i> first Planted at <i>Albemarle
Point</i>, on <i>Ashley</i> River, they have continu’d to do them all manner of friendly Offices,
ready on all occasions to supply them with any thing they have observ’d
them to want, not making use of our Mens Necessities, as an opportunity to enhance
the Price of their Commodities, a sort of fair Dealing we could scarce have
promis’d them amongst civiliz’d, well bred, and religious Inhabitants of any part
of <i>Europe</i>; and though they are much frighted with our Guns, both small and great,
yet like innocent and well-meaning People, they do not at all distrust our Power,
but freely, without suspicion, trust themselves, both Men and Women, even their
Kings themselves, in our Town, Lodging and Dancing there frequently whole
Nights together, upon no other Pledges but the bare confidence of our mutual
Friendship; nor do our Men use any greater caution in Conversing with them,
stragling up and down, and travelling singly and unarm’d through their Woods
for many Miles about, and are so far from receiving any injury or ill treatment
from them, that on the contrary they are kindly us’d and Entertain’d, and guided
by them in their Way whenever they desire it; and when any of our Men meet
them in their Walks, the <i>Indians</i> all stand still till they are gone by, civilly Saluting
them as they pass. Nor doth this Assurance of theirs bound it self within
their own Homes, they of their own accords venturing themselves aboard our Ships,
have gone voluntarily with our Men to <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Barbados</i>. Nor have the <i>English</i>
been wanting on their parts in any thing that may preserve this Amity, being very
cautious of doing them any injury, bartering with them for those things they
receive of them, and buying of them even the waste Land they make no use of.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides the simplicity of the <i>Indians</i> Diet, it is very remarkable, that they have a
general aversion to those two things which are most acceptable to our Palates, and
without which few of us either eat or drink with any delight; for in their Meats
they cannot endure the least mixture or rellish of Salt; and for their Drink, they
utterly abominate all manner of strong Liquor; to the latter whereof, their large
Growth and constant Health, is perhaps not a little owing.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their manner of Government.</div>

<p class='c010'>Every little Town is a distinct Principality, Govern’d by an Hereditary King,
who in some places is not Son, but Sisters Son to the precedent King, the Succession
of the Blood-Royal being continu’d by the safer side. The great Business of
those Princes is to lead their Men out against their Enemies in War, or against
the Beasts in Hunting; for unless it be to appoint them where to Hunt, or else to
Consult about making some Attempt upon their Enemy, he hath but small trouble
in the Government of his Subjects, who either through their own Honesty, or the
few occasions they have for Controversies in their <i>extempore</i> way of Living, need
few Laws, and little Severity to keep them in order; but yet they Govern their
People without Contract, and fail not of a ready Obedience to their Commands;
so that when some of them have bought things of such of the <i>English</i>, who by the
Orders made amongst our selves were not to Traffick with the <i>Indians</i>, they have,
upon Complaint made to their <i>Casiques</i>, been restor’d again, though in strict Rules
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>of Law they were neither bound by, nor oblig’d to take notice of the Rules which
were made onely to Govern our own People, and had at just Prices bought what
they carry’d away; such is the Honesty of Men, whose Principles not being corrupted
with Learning and Distinction, are contented to follow the Dictates of
right Reason, which Nature has sufficiently taught all Men for the well ordering
of their Actions, and enjoyment and preservation of humane Society, who do not
give themselves up to be amus’d and deceiv’d by insignificant Terms, and minding
what is just and right, seek not Evasions in the Niceties and Fallacies of Words.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Carolina</i> granted by Patent to several Noble Persons by His Majesty.</div>

<p class='c010'>The same is to be said of the first Discovery of this Countrey, as hath been formerly
said of <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Florida</i>, of both which it partakes; but as to the present
Interest and Propriety, the <i>English</i>, besides all <i>Virginia</i> intirely, have also so much
of <i>Florida</i> as makes up this considerable Province of <i>Carolina</i>, which soon after the
happy Restauration of His present Majesty King <i>Charles</i> II. from whom it receives
Denomination, was granted by Patent to <i>Edward</i> Earl of <i>Clarendon</i>, L. Chancellor
of <i>England</i>, <i>George</i> Duke of <i>Albemarle</i>, <i>William</i> Earl of <i>Craven</i>, <i>John</i> Lord <i>Berkley</i>, <i>Anthony</i>
Lord <i>Ashley</i>, Sir <i>George Carteret</i>, Vice-Chamberlain of His Majesty’s Houshold, Sir
<i>William Berkley</i>, Knight and Baronet, and Sir <i>John Colleton</i>, Knight and Baronet.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their care for Setling and Improving of this Plantation.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Lords-Proprietors of this Countrey, for the better Settlement of it according
to their Patent granted unto them by His Majesty, and for the enlargement of
the King’s Dominions in those parts of <i>America</i>, have been at great Charge to secure
this so rich and advantageous a Countrey to the Crown of <i>England</i>, to whom of ancient
Right, by the Discovery of Sir <i>Sebastian Cabott</i> in the time of <i>Henry</i> the Seventh,
it doth belong, and for its Situation, Fertility, Neighborhood to our other Plantations
and several other Conveniences, of too valuable consideration to be negligently
lost: By the Care therefore and Endeavors of those Great Men, it hath now two
considerable Colonies Planted in it, the one of <i>Albemarle</i>, on the North side, bordering
on <i>Virginia</i>, where are some hundreds of <i>English</i> Families remov’d thither
from <i>New England</i>, and some of our other Plantations in the <i>West-Indies</i>; and another
towards the middle of the Countrey, at <i>Charles-Town</i>, or <i>Ashley-River</i>, a Settlement
so hopeful, for the healthiness of the Land, and convenience of access by a
large deep Navigable River, and so promising in its very Infancy, that many of
the rich Inhabitants of <i>Barbados</i> and <i>Bermudas</i>, who are now crowded up in those
flourishing Islands, and many in our other <i>American</i> Plantations, are turning their
Eyes and Thoughts this way, and have already remov’d part of their Stock and
Servants thither. Nor is it to be doubted, but that many, following the Example
of those who went to <i>Albemarle</i>, will be drawn to this better Plantation at <i>Ashley-River</i>,
from <i>New-England</i>, where the heat of their Zeal, and the coldness of the Air,
doth not agree with every Man’s Constitution; and therefore it is to be thought,
that many well temper’d Men, who are not much at ease under such Extreams, will
be forward to remove hither.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fair Terms propos’d to whomsoever shall remove thither.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Lords-Proprietors, for the comfortable subsistence, and future enrichment
of all those who shall this Year 1671. Transport themselves and Servants thither,
allow every Man a hundred Acres <i>per</i> Head, for himself, his Wife, Children and
Servants, he carries thither, to him and his Heirs for ever, paying onely one Peny
an Acre, as a Chief-Rent; which Peny an Acre is not to be paid these nineteen years;
and those Servants who go along thither with their Masters, shall each also have
a hundred Acres upon the same Terms, when he is out of his Time. But though
these Conditions are very advantageous, and the Countrey promises to the Planter
Health, Plenty and Riches at a cheap Rate, yet there is one thing that makes this
Plantation more valuable than all these, and that is the secure possession of all these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>things with as great certainty as the state of humane Affairs, and the transient things of this Life are
capable of, in a well continu’d Form of Government, wherein it is made every Man’s Interest to preserve
the Rights of his Neighbor with his own; and those who have the greatest Power, have it limited
to the Service of the Countrey, the Good and Welfare whereof whilest they preserve and promote,
they cannot miss of their own, the Lords Proprietors having no other aim, than to be the
greatest Men in a Countrey where every one may be happy if it be not his own fault, it being almost
as uncomfortable, and much more unsafe, to be Lord over, than Companion of a miserable, unhappy,
and discontented Society of Men.</p>

<p class='c010'>With this Design the Lords-Proprietors, who are at great Charge for carrying on this Plantation,
have put the framing of a Government into the Hands of one, whose Parts and Experience in Affairs
of State are universally agreed on, and who is by all Men allow’d to know what is convenient for the
right ordering Men in Society, and setling a Government upon such Foundations, as may be equal,
safe, and lasting; and to this hath a Soul large enough to wish well to Mankind, and to desire, that all
the People where he hath to do might be happy. My Lord <i>Ashley</i> therefore, by the consent of his Brethren,
the rest of the Lords Proprietors, hath drawn up, to their general satisfaction, some fundamental
Constitutions, which are since, by their joynt approbation, confirm’d to be the Model and
Form of Government in the Province of <i>Carolina</i>; the main Design and Ballance thereof (according
to the best of my memory, having had a Copy thereof) in short is as followeth:</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The Model drawn up by the Lord <i>Ashley</i> for the Government of <i>Carolina</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>1. <span class='c006'>E</span>very County is to consist of forty square Plots, each containing twelve thousand Acres. Of
these square Plots each of the Proprietors is to have one, which is to be call’d a <i>Signiory</i>.
Eight of these square Plots are to be divided amongst the three Noble-men of that County, <i>viz.</i>
a <i>Landgrave</i>, who is to have four of them; and two <i>Casiques</i>, who are to have each of them two
apiece; and these square Plots belonging to the Nobility, are to be call’d <i>Baronies</i>. The other twenty
four square Plots, call’d <i>Colonies</i>, are to be the Possession of the People: And this Method is to be observ’d
in the Planting and Setting out of the whole Countrey; so that one Fifth of the Land is to be
in the Proprietors, one Fifth in the Nobility, and three Fifths in the People.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. The <i>Signories</i> and <i>Baronies</i>, that is, the hereditary Lands belonging to the Proprietors and Nobility,
are all entirely to descend to their Heirs, with the Dignity, without power of alienation, more
than for three Lives, or one and twenty years, or two Thirds of their <i>Signiories</i> and <i>Baronies</i>, and the
rest to be <i>Demesne</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. There will be also some Mannors in the Colonies, but none less than three thousand Acres in a
Piece, which, like the rest of the Colony Lands, will be alienable, onely with this difference, that it
cannot be parcell’d out, but if sold, it must be altogether.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. There is to be a Biennial Parliament, consisting of the eight Proprietors, the <i>Landgraves</i> and
<i>Casiques</i>, and one out of every Precinct, that is the six neighboring Colonies, for the People,
chosen by the Freeholders; these are to sit and Vote altogether for the making of Laws, which shall
be in force no longer than sixty years after their Enacting, the great mischief of most Governments,
by which not onely the People are mightily entangled by multiplicity of Rules and Penalties, and
thereby laid open to the Malice and Designs of troublesom Men and cunning Projectors; but, which
is far worse, the whole frame of the Government in tract of time comes to be remov’d from its original
Foundation, and thereby becomes more weak and tottering.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. There are eight supream Courts for the dispatch of all publick Affairs; the first consists of the
<i>Palatine</i>, who is the eldest of the Proprietors, and hath power to call Parliaments, and dispose of
publick Offices. The other seven supream Courts are, 1. The chief Justices for the determining of
Controversies of <i>Meum</i> and <i>Tuum</i>, and judging of Criminals. 2. The Chancellors, for passing of Charters,
and managing the State Matters of the Province. 3. The High-Constables, for Military Affairs.
4. The Admirals, for Maritime Affairs. 5. The High-Stewards, for Trade. 6. The Treasurers, for the
publick Stock; and 7. The Chamberlains, for Ceremonies, Fashions, Marriages, Burials, <i>&amp;c.</i> These
are the seven supream Courts, to whom lies the ultimate Appeal in all Causes belonging to them.
Each of these Courts consists of one Proprietor, and six other Councellors, whereof two are chosen
by the Nobility, and two by the People. All the number of these eight Courts joyn’d together make
the Grand Council, which are in the nature of a Council of State, and are entrusted with the management
of Affairs of greatest concernment. There is also in every County a Court, and in every
Precinct another; from the Precinct Court there lies an Appeal to the County Court, and from the
County Court to the Proprietors Court, to which the Matter in question belongs, and there is the
last decision and determination thereof, without any farther Appeal. And to keep the People from
the Charges and vexation of long Suits, to the enriching of Men cunning in Words, care is taken,
that no Cause shall be Try’d more than once in any one Court, and that profess’d Pleaders for
Money shall not be allow’d.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Liberty of Conscience</i> is here also allow’d in the greatest latitude, but yet so, that neither Atheists,
or Men of no Religion, are permitted; Atheism, Irreligion, and vicious Lives being condemn’d,
as disagreeable to humane Nature, inconsistent with Government and Societies, and destructive to all
that is useful to, or becoming of Mankind; as on the other hand, rigorous Imposing of, and hot
Contentions about the Ceremonies and Circumstances of Religion, is an occasion of perpetual Strife,
Faction and Division, keeps Men from sedate and temperate Enquiries after Truth, eats out the great
Cement of humane Conversation, <i>Charity</i>, and cannot be found in any one, who hath but modesty
enough to think himself less than a <i>Pope</i>, and short of <i>Infallibility</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is also to be a Register of all Grants and Conveyances of Land, to prevent even the occasions
of Controversies and Law-Suits.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are several other less considerable Particulars in this Government, all contriv’d and design’d
for the good and welfare of the People; all which are so well put together, and in such equal
proportion ballance each other, that some judicious Men who have seen it, say, it is the best and fairest
Frame, for the well-being of those who shall live under it, of any they have seen or read of.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Bounds.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>South-West of <i>Virginia</i> lieth the spacious Countrey of <i>Florida</i>, remarkable hitherto
rather by the great pains which the <i>Spaniards</i> have taken, and the ill
Successes they have met with in the discovery and search of this Province,
than by any thing else they have discover’d in it answerable to their desires. On the
East it hath the <i>Atlantick Ocean</i>, or <i>Mare del Nordt</i>; on the South, and South-West,
the Gulph of <i>Mexico</i> and <i>Mare Virginium</i>; and full West, part of <i>New Gallicia</i>, and
some other Countreys, not yet perfectly known.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Ponce</i>’s Expedition.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Water to make old People look young.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey is also one of those, said to have been first of all discover’d by
Sir <i>Sebastian Cabot</i>, at the Charges of the King of <i>England</i>, about the Year 1497. but
afterwards more throughly search’d into by <i>John Ponce de Leon</i>, a <i>Spaniard</i>, who in
the Year 1512. set Sail with three Ships out of the Haven <i>St. German</i> in <i>Porto Rico</i>,
North-West to the Isles <i>Del Veio</i>, <i>Caycos</i>, <i>Yaguna</i>, <i>Amaguyao</i>, <i>Manegua</i>, and <i>Guanahani</i>,
first discover’d by <i>Christopher Colonus</i>, and call’d <i>St. Salvador</i>: After that Steer’d North-West
by a Coast, which (because of its pleasant prospect) was call’d <i>Florida</i> or (according
to the more common Opinion) because it was on <i>Palm-Sunday</i>, which the
<i>Spaniards</i> call <i>Pascha de Flores</i>, (or <i>Pascha Florida</i>) that he Landed here: And to
find out a Haven he kept sight of the Shore, which appear’d South-West from
him. Here the Ships met with so strong a Tide, that notwithstanding they had a
fresh Gale of Wind, yet could they not stem it; one of the Ships was driven to Sea
out of sight; the other two casting Anchor, which raking, drove toward the Shore;
whither, being beckned by the <i>Indians</i>, they immediately went; when no sooner
he Landed, but they ran in great Companies to make themselves Masters of the
Vessels, kill’d one <i>Spaniard</i>, and wounded two more: the Night approaching put an
end to the Fight. From hence Sailing to the River <i>La Cruix</i> for Wood and Water,
they were resisted by sixty Natives, which they put to flight with their Guns, and
took one Prisoner; after which they erected a Stone Cross. The Promontory, by
which glides the strong Current, lies in twenty Degrees North-Latitude, and call’d
<i>Cabo de Corrientes</i>, as the Row of Isles, before the Main Land <i>Los Martyres</i>, because
the Cliffs at a distance appear like Men standing on Poles. Lastly, after some small
Encounters with the <i>Floridans</i>, <i>Ponce</i> return’d home, being onely inform’d falsly by
the <i>Indians</i>, that in <i>Florida</i> was a River, and on the Isle <i>Bimini</i> a Fountain, whose
Waters made old People young.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Vasquez</i>’s Expedition to <i>Florida</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Habit of a <i>Floridan</i> King.</div>

<p class='c010'>But after this <i>Florida</i> remained not unvisited; for eight years after the foremention’d
Voyage, <i>Lucas Vasquez de Aylom</i> weighed Anchor with two Ships from <i>Hispaniola</i>,
to fetch Slaves from the adjacent Isles for the Gold-Mines, which Labor the
Natives were not able to perform: therefore steering his Course Northwardly, he
Sail’d along the Coast of <i>Chicoa</i> and <i>Gualdape</i>, by them call’d <i>Cabo de St. Helena</i>, and
<i>Rio Jordan</i>, where the Natives look’d upon the Ships as Sea-Monsters, and seeing
Bearded Men in them, fled: the <i>Spaniards</i> pursuing them, overtook one Man and a
Woman; who being well Entertain’d, and Clad in <i>Spanish</i> Habits, made the Strangers
so acceptable to their Countrey-men, that their King sent fifty Men Aboard of
them with Provisions, and to invite the Sea-men to his Dominions. The King sat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>with a great Cloth about him, made fast on his Shoulders, covering his Belly,
Breast and Back with the Lappet thereof, and being long, was held up by one of
his Servants; over one of his Shoulders hung a String of Pearl that came three
times about, and reach’d down to his Thighs; on his Head he wore a Cap full of
Ribbonds; his Arms and Legs were also surrounded with a double Chain of Pearl;
in his right Hand he held a very rich Staff: But the Queen went almost naked,
onely a piece of a wild Beasts Skin hung down before her from her left Shoulder
to her mid-Leg, and a double String of Pearl about her Neck hung down between
her Breasts, and her Hair Comb’d behind reach’d down to the Calves of her Legs;
about her Wrists and Ancles hung also Strings of Pearl.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Treachery of <i>Vasquez</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Indians</i> misused.</div>

<p class='c010'>On the King’s Command, the <i>Spaniards</i> were permitted to make inspection into
the Countrey, in which they were every where courteously Entertain’d, and not
without Gold and Silver Presents. Returning Aboard, <i>Vasquez</i> invited the <i>Indians</i>
to go with him, under pretence of returning them thanks for the Favours which
they had bestowed upon him; but no sooner had he gotten a considerable number
in his Ships, but he set Sail, and losing one Ship, arriv’d with the other safe at
<i>Hispaniola</i> with a few <i>Indians</i>, for most of them with grief and hunger died at Sea,
and those that remain’d alive, liv’d on dead Carrion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Vasquez</i> defeated by the <i>Floridans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Some few years after, <i>Vasquez</i> receiving Letters Patent from the Court of <i>Spain</i>
for the Government of <i>Florida</i>, fitted out a Ship thither in 1620. which brought a
good Return of Gold, Silver, and Pearls; whereupon he himself went not long after,
and coming into the River <i>Jordan</i>, lost one of his Ships, which proved not the
worst Accident; for Landing two hundred Men, they were all of them either slain
or wounded by the Inhabitants; so that <i>Vasquez</i> was forc’d to sound a Retreat:
And after that the <i>Spaniards</i> were less willingly drawn to that Coast, and the rather,
because the Inhabitants seem’d poor, and had little Gold but what they procur’d
from the <i>Otapales</i> and <i>Olugatono</i>’s, sixty Leagues Northward up in the Countrey.</p>

<p class='c010'>Notwithstanding these unsuccessful Expeditions, <i>Pamphilus Narvaez</i> retain’d so
much Courage, that obtaining Letters Patents from the Emperor <i>Charles</i> the Fifth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>he fitted out four Sail and a Brigantine, weigh’d Anchor from <i>Cuba</i> with six hundred
Men and eighty Horse, in the Year 1528. On <i>Florida</i> he Landed three hundred
Foot and forty two Horse; they found many empty Huts, but in a great House
a golden Bell hid amongst the Nets, Chests full of Merchandise, and in each a dead
Body cover’d with Beast Skins, and painted; Pieces of Linnen Cloth, and Wedges of
Gold, which they had from the remote Countrey <i>Apalache</i>.  <i>Narvaez</i>, though against
the Opinion of <i>Nunnez Cabeca</i>, march’d up into the Countrey, whilst the Fleet was
to stand along the Shore, and travelling fifteen days saw neither House nor Man,
onely here and there some <i>Palmito</i>-Trees: Crossing a River on Floats, they were
Encountred by two hundred of the Natives; of which the <i>Spaniards</i>, having routed
them, took six Prisoners, who furnish’d them plentifully with <i>Indian</i> Wheat. After
this they march’d fifteen days farther, without discerning the least foot-step of a
Man; but at last they met an <i>Indian</i> Lord with a considerable Train, before whom
march’d several Pipers: being told by <i>Narvaez</i> that his Journey was for <i>Apalache</i>,
he conducted the <i>Spaniards</i> with a <i>Canoo</i> over a River, and Landing again, walk’d
with them to his Village, where he Entertain’d them with great civility. <i>Narvaez</i>,
after a long and troublesom Journey, came at last in sight of <i>Apalache</i>, a Village
which contained two hundred and forty Straw Houses, built between the Mountains
on a Moorish Soyl, full of Nut, Pine, and Savine-Trees, Oaks, Laurel, and
short <i>Palmito</i>’s, besides the Trees, which blown down in several places by a strong
Wind from between the Hills, and lying cross, cumber the High-ways: There are
many deep Pools, and also Bears, Lyons, and other ravenous Creatures, which
make the Ways very dangerous. <i>Narvaez</i> falling suddenly on the Village, took the
<i>Casique</i> Prisoner, as also store of Wheat, Mortars to pound it, Hides, and Thred-spun
Cloaks. Here he rested twenty five days, during which time some of his
Men Journey’d farther into the Countrey, yet found none but poor People,
troublesom Ways, and an unfruitful Soyl: twice they were set upon by the Natives,
who kill’d some of the Horses and Men: They being a very strong People
run stark naked, and as swift as a Deer, Diving under Water from the <i>Spaniards</i>
Bullets; which not a little amazing <i>Narvaez</i>, he thought it convenient to set upon
the Village <i>Aute</i>, lying on the Shore: Nine days he was in a miserable condition
before he got any Wheat, Pease, or other Provisions from this Village; the getting
whereof cost him very dear, for the Villagers behav’d themselves so valiantly,
that they kill’d many <i>Spaniards</i>, and some of their Horses, which since they left the
Haven of <i>St. Cruce</i> had travell’d two hundred and eighty Leagues; so that being
tir’d and out of heart, they could not carry the Sick and Wounded, who not able
to go, fell down dead in the Way: whereupon it was judg’d convenient to make
five Barques, in which they made their Shirts serve for Sails, the Horses Tails and
Mayns for Ropes, their Skins to hold fresh Water; with which putting out to Sea,
they saw no Land in seven days; and running through the Straights of <i>St. Miguell</i>,
Steer’d along the Coast of <i>Rio del Palmes</i>; where they suffer’d great Drought, insomuch
that some drinking salt Water, died thereof: at last Landing, they were in
the Night set upon by a <i>Casique</i>, who having given <i>Narvaez</i> a great Wound in the
Face, fled, leaving behind him a Sable Cloak, scented with Amber; three days they
rang’d again along the Sea-shore, when the Barque of <i>Nunnez Cabeca</i> being behind,
was by Storm driven on the Shore, where a hundred <i>Indians</i> waited to cut them off,
but were pacifi’d with some Trifles: Thus being bereav’d of Arms, Provision,
and all manner of Necessaries, they found themselves on an Isle, by the Inhabitants
call’d <i>Malhado</i>, where they were lodg’d and maintain’d so long as they had
any thing left; but Famine grew at last to such a heighth, that they devour’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>one another, and in a short time of eighty Men there remain’d onely four alive, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Nunnez Cabeca</i>, <i>Castillo</i>, <i>Orantes</i>, and <i>Estevanico</i>, who at last by Land reach’d to <i>New
Gallicia</i>, and soon after to <i>Mexico</i>, having escap’d a thousand Dangers. Of <i>Pamphilus
Narvaez</i> never any tydings being heard, it is suppos’d he was drown’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Fight.</div>

<p class='c010'>After this miserable Adventure, the Business of <i>Florida</i> lay dead for eleven years,
till <i>Ferdinandus Sottus</i>, chosen Governor of <i>Cuba</i>, obtain’d so much of the Emperor
<i>Charles</i> the Fifth, that he ventur’d one Expedition more for <i>Florida</i>: Besides Seamen
he carried five hundred Foot, and three hundred and fifty Horse; with which
Landing in the Bay <i>Del Espirito Santo</i>, he march’d against the Casique <i>Vitacucho</i>, whom
he took Prisoner, with a thousand of the Natives, whom he either put to the
Sword, or caus’d them to be torn in pieces by Dogs; and staying all the Winter in
<i>Apalache</i>, fortifi’d that place, and furnish’d himself with Provisions; he was inform’d,
that thirteen days Journey from thence lay the Kingdom of <i>Cofachiqui</i>, abounding
with Gold, Silver, and Pearls, which made every one of the <i>Spaniards</i> very desirous
to go thither, notwithstanding the Way was very dangerous; for the valiant
<i>Floridans</i> lying in Ambuscade in the Corn-Fields, wounded and kill’d many of
them by Shooting from thence. <i>Sottus</i>, so soon as <i>March</i> approached, set forward on
his Way. In the poor Province of <i>Achalaqui</i> he found a few young People, and the
old most of them blind. From <i>Cofachiqui</i> he was follow’d by four thousand Natives,
who carried the <i>Spaniards</i> Luggage, and serv’d them as Guides through Woods
and Wildernesses. The seventh day they stopp’d at a great River, whither <i>Sottus</i>
sent four Companies to seek out a Passage over, whereof three return’d without
any effect, but the fourth, Commanded by Captain <i>Annasio</i>, and a Colonel of a
thousand <i>Cofachiquians</i>, came to a Village built along the River; in which they made
a miserable Rout, killing all they lighted on, and hanging the Sculls of the Dead by
their sides: this done, they march’d back. <i>Sottus</i> at last espying a Village on the
other side of the River, beckned to the Natives to come over to him; whereupon
six came immediately; who understanding that he desir’d their friendly Assistance
and Trade, promis’d to acquaint their Governess, being a young Maiden: who
soon after came over to <i>Sottus</i>, and presented him with a String of Pearl: he complain’d
to her for Provisions, which she promis’d in part to store him with. Crossing
the River he found a brave Countrey, where were Pearls as big as gray Pease,
Copper of a golden colour, but no Gold. Out of the Tombs of their Princes the
<i>Spanish</i> Officers, with the leave of the fore-mention’d Maid their Governess, got an
incredible Treasure in Pearls. In the Village <i>Tolomeco</i> they did the like. But here
their Provisions growing scarce, the Army was divided into two Bodies, <i>Balthasar
de Gallegos</i> leading one, and <i>Sottus</i> the other; yet the Design of them both was on
the Province of <i>Chalaque</i>; whither marching, they were surpris’d by such a violent
Storm, that few would have been left to relate their Adventures, had not the Trees
bore it off from them; for it not onely Thundred and Lightned as if Heaven and
Earth would have met, but also Hail-stones fell down as big as Eggs, which beat
down the Boughs of Trees. In the pleasant Valley <i>Xualu</i>, belonging to the Kingdom
of <i>Cofachiqui</i>, they rested fifteen days, and then march’d through Countreys of
<i>Guaxale</i>, <i>Acostes</i>, and <i>Coza</i>, where above a thousand <i>Indians</i>, adorn’d with Plumes of
Feathers and rich Furr Cloaks, came to meet and welcom them, and to desire them
from the <i>Casique</i> to stay there all the Winter; but <i>Sottus</i> resolving to go to the Haven
<i>Achusi</i>, refus’d the same. After this he view’d <i>Talisse</i>, fortifi’d with woodden and
earthen Bulwarks; where the Casique <i>Tascalusa</i>, a Man as big again as an ordinary
<i>Spaniard</i>, receiv’d <i>Sottus</i> with great civility, and conducted him to <i>Mavilla</i>, lying in
a pleasant place. The City, surrounded with double Pallisado’s, fill’d up with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>Earth between, (where also at eighty Paces distant from one another, stands a
Tower to contain eighty Soldiers) hath two Gates, eighty Houses, in every one of
which dwell a thousand Men, and a large Market-place in the middle; where
whilst the <i>Spaniards</i> were in the midst of their Mirth, they on a sudden heard a
great cry of Arms; the first Assault was made by seven thousand, which still increased
by fresh Supplies; but the <i>Spaniards</i> at last setting the City on fire, broke
through them, and left above eleven thousand slain, either by the Smoak and
Flame, or by their Bullets, Swords, Horses Heels and Dogs; the <i>Spaniards</i> also lost
eighty three Men and forty three Horses. Thence going to <i>Chicora</i> they were stopt
by the Natives before a deep River with high Banks, which at last crossing, not
without great trouble and blood-shedding, they Winter’d in the Village <i>Chicora</i>,
where the Inhabitants let them rest very quietly for two Moneths; at the end of
which, joyning together in the Night, they shot fire into the Straw Roofs, and
maintain’d a Fight of two hours long, in which the <i>Spaniards</i> lost forty Men, fifty
Horses, and all their Hogs, which were burnt in the Houses. From thence going to
<i>Chicacolla</i> they were resisted in most places, and in the Fort <i>Alibamo</i> Engag’d by four
thousand <i>Floridans</i>, who waited for their coming; but those were so shrewdly handled,
that half of them were slain, and <i>Sottus</i> became Master of the Fort, as also of
<i>Chisca</i>, which he Storm’d and took unawares. With no less trouble and danger did
he get over the River <i>El Grande</i>, where he discover’d a Village that contain’d above
four hundred Houses, and many delightful Fruit-Trees. The Casique <i>Casquin</i>, maintain’d
the <i>Spanish</i> Army six days in this place, and taking five thousand of his Subjects,
march’d with them to <i>Capaha</i>, which hath a deep and broad Moat on three
sides thereof: the fourth was fortifi’d with strong Pallisado’s, through which the
<i>Spaniards</i> breaking, made way for <i>Casquin</i>, who put all to the Sword, the Governor
onely escaping in a <i>Canoo</i> to a neighboring Isle. The Entrance being thus taken by
the <i>Spaniards</i>, <i>Casquin</i> return’d home. After which <i>Sottus</i> concluded a Peace with
<i>Capahaes</i> the Governor, and took up his Quarters in the Village <i>Vitangue</i>, where he
receiv’d continual Sallies; but taking fifteen <i>Casiques</i> Prisoners, threatned to burn
them alive, unless they would procure them some Gold; yet not being able to get
any, they had only their Hands cut off and were sent away. Moreover, <i>Sottus</i> help’d
the <i>Guachacoya</i>’s, to ruine those of <i>Anilco</i>; which Design prov’d successful, yet not according
to <i>Sottus</i>’s desire, for he found not the Gold-Mines which he expected, but
spent in this five years Progress the great Treasure which he took out of <i>Atibaliba</i>’s
Palace; and the Pearls which he got in <i>Florida</i>, for the Oysters being open’d against
the Fire, and the Pearls drill’d through with a hot Iron, lost much of their lustre,
neither would his People consent to build a City in the Haven <i>Achusi</i>. In the midst
of these Transitions <i>Sottus</i> died of the Bloody-flux, and his Body was Interr’d in
the River <i>El Grande</i>. After which his Successor <i>Ludovicus de Alvarado</i> had worse success,
for half of the Army being wasted by the excessive heat, the rest resolv’d
to desert <i>Florida</i>, utterly despairing to be ever able to resist the valiant Natives. In
the Province of <i>Auche</i> they procur’d a Guide, whom, because he mis-led them in their
Way, they caus’d to be torn in pieces by their Dogs: after which they march’d
without a Guide through such bad Ways, that they lost a hundred of their Men and
eighty Horses, besides many <i>Floridans</i> that carried their Luggage: At last coming
to the River <i>El Grande</i> they conquer’d two Villages; which fortifying, they took
up their Winter Quarters in them. But this being the fourteenth year, in which
the River us’d generally to overflow and drown all the adjacent Countreys, on a
sudden, to their great amazement, the Wood which they had gather’d for the building
of Barques to carry them home, was wash’d away, their Provisions spoil’d,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>and their Habitations drown’d: and to this Inconvenience was added another yet
greater; for the Governors round about rais’d all the Forces they could possibly,
to revenge themselves on the <i>Spaniards</i> for their great oppression. But <i>Alvarado</i>
being inform’d of this Design by the Casique <i>Anilco</i>, caus’d thirty of the Abettors
of the Plot to have their Hands cut off. Not long after this the <i>Spaniards</i> set
Sail, when a thousand <i>Canoos</i> that came to Engage them lay sixteen days amongst
them, killing and wounding several of the Seamen, and sunk a Barque with forty
eight Men, and also kill’d many Horses which were yet on the Shore; the Prisoners
they took were strappado’d to death, and the Horses shot: yet some of them got
safe from <i>Panuco</i> to <i>Mexico</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Expedition of <i>Ahumada</i> and <i>Samano</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>These above-mention’d Expeditions to <i>Florida</i>, notwithstanding they fell out
unfortunately, nevertheless by the permission of <i>Philip</i> the Second, King of <i>Spain</i>,
<i>Peter Ahumada</i> and <i>Julius Samano</i>, with five <i>Dominican</i> Monks, made another Attempt,
and Landed with several great Crosses, that thereby they might reduce the <i>Floridans</i>,
whose Language they understood not, to their Faith: But they fearing treachery,
resisted them, and kill’d the Monks with Clubs, flay’d them, and hung their
Skins in their Temples.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Expedition of <i>Menendez</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Notwithstanding these and many worse Accidents that hapned, yet the <i>Spanish</i>
King ventur’d once more, and sent <i>Peter Menendez</i> to <i>Florida</i>; whither he was follow’d
by three <i>Jesuits</i> from <i>Rome</i>, <i>viz.</i> <i>Peter Martinius</i>, <i>Joan Roger</i>, and <i>Francis Villaregius</i>:
The Master of the Ship in which they went being ignorant where he was,
judg’d it convenient to Land; whereupon nine <i>Netherlanders</i> and four <i>Spaniards</i>,
amongst which was <i>Martinius</i>, went ashore on <i>Florida</i>, whilst a Storm arising drove
the Ship to <i>Cuba</i>; by which means those that were Landed were left in a miserable
condition, having no Food but wild Herbs, on which they fed twelve days: so that
this Expedition also came to nothing.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Voyage of <i>Ribald</i> and <i>Laudoniere</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>At last the <i>French</i> following the foot-steps of the <i>Spaniards</i>, <i>John Ribald</i> and <i>Rene
Laudoniere</i> having Sail’d several times to <i>Florida</i>, discover’d several Coasts; but their
Men were often set upon by the <i>Spaniards</i>, and cut off.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Expedition of <i>Dominicus Gurgius</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Valiant Exploit of <i>Gurgius</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Anno 1567.</i> <i>Dominicus Gurgius</i> set Sail thither with three Ships, which carried two
hundred Soldiers and eighty Sea-men; with which entring the River <i>Tacatucouru</i> he
Landed, and found a Youth call’d <i>Peter du Bre</i>, who escap’d when the <i>Spaniards</i> cruelly
massacred the <i>French</i> in the Garrison <i>Carolina</i>; after which <i>du Bre</i> ranging up
and down, at last serv’d <i>Saturiona</i>, Governor of <i>Florida</i>; whom deserting, and now
meeting with the <i>French</i> his Countrey-men, he brought several <i>Casiques</i> to joyn with
them against the <i>Spaniards</i>, whom they drove out of three Forts, which were all by
the Command of <i>Gurgius</i> dismanteled.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>City <i>Augustine</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Florida</i> is call’d by the Natives, <i>Irquasa</i>. The <i>Spaniards</i> have built two Forts on
the same, the one erected on the Promontory <i>Helena</i>, is Consecrated to the Apostle
<i>Matthew</i>. The City and the Fort <i>Augustine</i> lies near the River <i>May</i>. Both City and
Fort stand on a Hill, which is pleasant and well set with Trees. Between the <i>Foreland</i>
is a deep and wide Channel, which washes the City and Fort; it is eight-square,
at each corner there stands a round Tower, in which the Soldiers keep Guard; the
Countrey is water’d by two Rivers, which gliding between the <i>Main</i> and the <i>Foreland</i>,
are great Safeguards to the Fort. The City is almost square, onely against the
Fort it is much closer built than in any other place, and divided into four Streets.
The Church stands without of the City, and before it the <i>Augustine</i> Cloyster.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their strange Consultation.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Priests are Sorcerers.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange actions.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Cruelty on the conquer’d.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Remarkable Mourning for the Dead.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Inhabitants of <i>Florida</i> are an Olive colour, tall, and without any deformity;
their Skins generally painted, and their Bodies naked, onely a Deer’s Skin
about their middle, their Hair long and black, hanging down to their Hams, but
most of them tie it in a Knot on the top of their Heads; two small Boards cover
their Breasts, and six lesser hang on their Arms, two Bells at each Ear, and a
Cap on their Head, with a Feather: Their Quivers, which are always full of Arrows,
sharpned with Fish Bones, hang by their Sides; In their left-Hand they hold
a great Bowe, with which they go to War, the King walking before with a Club.
They Consult daily about warlike Affairs in the King’s Palace, where he himself
sits on a high Seat; the Grandees salute him first with their Hands lifted over their
Head, crying <i>Ha, He, Ya</i>, at which the rest cry <i>Ha, Ha</i>; then every one sits down
on a Stool round about the Room. If they have any Business of Consequence to
debate, then the King sends for the ancientest Persons and Priests, call’d <i>Jawas</i>;
this done, they give a Cup of <i>Cassine</i> (which is a hot Drink made of Herbs) to the
King; after which every one drinks in order out of the same Cup. This Liquor
occasions Sweat, quenches Thirst, and satisfies the Appetite for twenty four hours.
When they March against their Enemies they live on <i>Indian</i> Wheat, Honey,
smoak’d Fish, and divers sorts of wild Roots, amongst which they mix Sand and
Cinders, to preserve them the longer. No sooner are the two Armies come within
sight one of another, but the Kings of both Parties roll their Eyes about in their
Heads, mutter something to themselves, and make strange Gestures and Exclamations;
which is answer’d by a general Cry of the whole Army: then each King turning
himself with great Reverence to the Sun, takes a woodden Platter with Water,
which he throws over his Army so far as he is able, and begs of the Sun to grant
him, that he may spill his Enemies Blood in like manner; then throws another
Dish-full into the Fire, wishing that his Soldiers may thus Offer the Bodies of their
Foes to the Flames; then step forth the Priests, who are always skill’d in the Art
of Necromancy, and seating themselves on a Shield in the midst of the Army,
draw a Circle, in which they make many strange Gestures, not without muttering
to themselves, and seemingly say a Prayer of a quarter of an hour long; during
which they deport themselves so strangely, that they rather seem to be Devils themselves,
than Charmers of the Devil: They turn their Eyes quite round, and their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Bodies as if without Joynts; at length being wearied they leap out of the Circle,
and inform the King of the number and condition of the Enemies Army. Those
whom they take Prisoners they flay alive, and drying their Skins at the Fire, tie them
to long Poles, and carry them home as Trophies of their Victory, and afterwards
set them up in some Field or spacious place, putting both Men and Women to
watch them; then comes the Priest with a woodden Image, and utters Execrations
against the slain Enemies; at a corner of the Fields kneel three Men, one of which
striking with great force on a Stone, gives as many Blows as the Priest pronounces
Curses, whilst the other two shake their <i>Calabashes</i> fill’d with Stones, and Sing many
strange Songs: No sooner is this ended, but the Women whose Husbands are slain
in the Battel, walking to the King, cover their Faces with their Hands, make many
strange Gestures, and desire liberty to take what revenge they can, and licence also to
Marry at the limited time; all which the King permitting, they return thus comforted
home crying. Not long after they go to the place where their Husbands lie
buried, where they crop their Hair up to their Ears, and throw it on the Grave, as
also the Arms and Drinking-Cups which the Deceased us’d in their life-time; after
which they may not Marry before their Hair be grown again to their Shoulders.
The same Custom is also observ’d when their King is buried but then also all his
Subjects Fast and Howl three days together, stick his Grave full of Arrows, and
burn his House and all his Goods.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Floridans</i> differ amongst themselves.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Floridans</i> differ amongst themselves very much, for those that inhabit the
Province <i>Panuca</i>, which borders upon <i>New Spain</i>, are valiant and cruel People,
Offering their Prisoners to their Idols, and eating them. The Men pluck up the Hair
of their Beards by the Root, make holes through their Nose and Ears, and Marry
not till their fortieth Year.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next to these follow the Realms of <i>Aranaris</i> and <i>Albardaosia</i>, inhabited by a People,
which exceed all others in subtilty.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Natives of <i>Jaquazia</i> run faster than a Deer, and tire not though they travel
a whole day.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Hermophrodites.</div>

<p class='c010'>The best Swimmers are found in <i>Alpachia</i>, <i>Authia</i>, and <i>Someria</i>, where the Women
Swim through deep and great Rivers with their Children in their Arms. Here
also are many Hermophrodites, which carry all the Luggage when an Army is
upon a March.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their manner of taking Crocodiles.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>As also their Deer.</div>

<p class='c010'>We find mention’d also two other Provinces of note, <i>viz.</i> <i>Colas</i> (which lies near
the Point call’d <i>Cape Florida</i>) and <i>Tegista</i>, or <i>Florida</i> properly so call’d, being that long
<i>Peninsula</i>, which pointing upon the Isle <i>Cuba</i>, by the Cape <i>Los Martyres</i>, stretcheth it
self North and South about a hundred Leagues in length, but not above thirty in
breadth where it is largest. In this Province is the <i>Rio de lo Spirito Santo</i>. The Soyl,
though it produces <i>Indian</i> Wheat twice a year, yet it is never Dung’d, but when
the Corn (which is planted in <i>March</i> and <i>June</i>) is in, they burn the Weeds; the
Ashes of which serves them in stead of Soil. The King divides the Corn according
to every Mans Family. In the Winter they dwell four Moneths in the
Woods, where they build small Huts of Palm-boughs, feed on Venison, smoak’d
Fish, and Crocodiles, which have pure white Flesh, and are caught after this manner:
On the Shore of the Rivers they build little Houses full of round Holes, in
which they place a Watch, who is to give notice to ten or twelve Associates, cover’d
all over with Boughs full of little sharp Prickles, which they thrust into the
Crocodiles Throat, who with open Mouth comes running at them, and so throwing
him on his Back, stick his Belly full of Arrows, and kill him with Clubs. But
with more subtilty and art they take their Deer, <i>viz.</i> They hide themselves under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>a Stags Skin, so cunningly, that it seems as if living, which they place near the
Rivers where the Deer generally come to drink, when on a sudden they shoot
them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Floridans</i>, though libidinous, yet live long.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Priests serve in stead of Chirurgeons, wherefore they always carry a
Bag full of Herbs about with them, which are chiefly good against venereal Distempers;
for these People are exceeding libidinous; nay, Sodomy and defiling of
young Children is accounted no sin: Yet though they are much inclin’d to Women,
they attain to a great Age.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Rene Laudoniere</i> Landing not far from the City <i>Augustine</i>, situate on the Banks of
the River <i>May</i>, met with the <i>Floridan</i> Governor <i>Saturiona</i>, who conducted him to the
<i>French</i> King’s Court of Arms, erected two years before, which <i>Saturiona</i>, as a testimony
of his zeal to the <i>French</i>, had Crown’d with Laurel and Flowers. <i>Saturiona</i>
had with him also his Son <i>Atoreus</i>, who had begotten divers Children on his Mother;
whom his Father after that time no more acknowledging, resign’d her up
wholly to him: At which time also his great Grandfather being then living, was
above a hundred and fifty years old, and saw his Childrens Children to the fifth
Generation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their horrid Religion.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Religion in <i>Florida</i> is abominable, wicked, and cruel: When they return
Conquerors from a Battel, the old Women rake off the dry’d Hair from the
fore-mention’d Poles, hold it aloft, and thank the Sun for their Victory. But the
Offerings of their first-born Sons are terrible, for they knock out their Brains with
a Club in the presence of the King. Their annual worshipping of the Sun is also
very ridiculous; for filling the Skin of a Stag full of sweet-smelling Herbs, they
hang the Horns and Neck with Garlands, and carry it with the noise of their kind
of Vocal and Instrumental Musick, to a high Trunk or hollow Body of a Tree, on
which they place the stuff’d Stag, with his Head towards the Sun; which done, they
falling down, desire that he would please to afford them plenty of all such Fruit as
they Offer to him; after which taking their leave, they let the fore-mention’d Skin
remain there till the following Year.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spaniards</i> since their Defeat in the Fort <i>Carolina</i>, and their Engagement with
Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>, <i>Anno 1585.</i> have had little disturbance on <i>Florida</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Drake</i>’s Exploit on <i>Florida</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Drake</i> having burnt and plunder’d <i>Domingo</i> and <i>Carthagena</i>, steer’d along the Coast
of <i>Florida</i>, and discover’d a Beacon on the same; whereupon he sent out Spies, who
sail’d a League up a River, on whose Banks they saw a Fort, and somewhat higher
the Town <i>Augustine</i>, built full of woodden Houses; all which being related to
him, he steer’d thither, fir’d his Guns twice against the Fort <i>St. John</i>; which the
<i>Spaniards</i> answering onely with one Volley, fled, with their Commander <i>Peter Menendez</i>;
when the <i>English</i> prepar’d to Storm, a Prisoner, being a <i>French</i>-man, came in
a Boat from them to <i>Drake</i>, and inform’d him that the <i>Spaniards</i> had left the City
<i>Augustine</i> and Fort <i>St. John</i>; to which <i>Drake</i> going, found there Pallisado’s of pleited
Boughs, cover’d with Earth, and a Chest with two thousand Pound, for the payment
of the Soldiers, and fourteen Brass Guns, with which he set Sail from thence.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Mountains of this Countrey are onely the <i>Apalatei</i>, suppos’d by the Natives
to have rich Mines of Gold in them, and which the <i>Spaniards</i> saw, but had
not time, nor other accommodation to stay and search them, by reason they were
so much wearied and wasted with a long March before they gat thither, and found
the People so stout and obstinate thereabouts, that in stead of entertaining them
with their Hens and Fowl, as other places had done, they were welcom’d with
Blows, and made to return, leaving not a few of their best Soldiers behind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Rivers there are many, and those very large and commodious, as 1. <i>Rio Secco</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>or <i>The Dry River</i>, so call’d by the <i>Spaniards</i> (as some think) because they could find
no Gold in it. 2. <i>Rio Grande</i>, or <i>The Great River</i>. 3. <i>Ligeris.</i> 4. <i>Garunna.</i> 5. <i>Sequana</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> These last, so nam’d by the <i>French</i>, who, after the <i>Spaniards</i>, for some time had,
but never held any long possession of the Countrey. There are also <i>Rio de Flores</i>,
<i>Rio de Nieves</i>, and <i>Rio de Spirito Santo</i>, lesser Streams, yet all of them, with the rest,
falling at several places into the great Lake of <i>Mexico</i>; and some of them not a little
haunted by the <i>Caymans</i> or <i>West-Indian</i> Crocodiles, a Creature, as hath been said before,
dangerous both at Sea and Land.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Natives, who as yet hold Possession and Command of it for the most part,
are themselves generally sorted into certain Tribes or great Families; all which are
Govern’d severally by Chiefs of their own, whom they call <i>Paracoussi</i>, and by reason
thereof are almost continually in Feud and War one with another.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Towns and Places most known in this Province, are 1. <i>St. Helens</i>, seated on
or near unto a Promontory of the same Name, where this Countrey bordereth on
<i>Virginia</i>. 2. <i>Fort Charles</i>, or <i>Arx Carolina</i>, built and so nam’d by the <i>French</i> King, but
afterwards ruin’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>. 3. <i>Port Royal</i>, a well frequented Haven, at the
Mouth of a River which beareth the same Name. More within Land there is,
1. <i>Apalache</i>, an old Town of the Natives, formerly a Place of great resort, but now
a poor thing of about forty or fifty Cottages; and yet as poor as it is, <i>Pamphilius
Narvaez</i>, as before related, when he search’d the Countrey, found the Natives
not willing to part with it: for though he took it from them, it was not without
some resistance, and they quickly recover’d it again: and at the 2. nam’d <i>Aute</i>, another
old Town of theirs, nine days March from the other, they overtook him, and
fell so resolutely upon him, that he left not a few of his best Soldiers dead upon the
place, and was content himself to march quietly away with the rest. 3. <i>Ochalis</i>, a
Town consisting of about five or six hundred Sheds and Cottages likewise of the
Natives. 4. <i>Vittacuche</i>, a Burrough of two hundred Houses.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is also on the Eastern Shore of this <i>Peninsula</i>, <i>St. Matthews</i>, a Place possess’d
and well fortifi’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>; and <i>St. Augustines</i> on the same Shore, but
lying somewhat more Southerly than the other, at the Mouth of a River of the
same Name, taken and sack’d by Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> in the Year 1585.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'><i>Jucatan</i> is a <i>Peninsula</i>, or half-Island, being encompass’d with the Sea on all sides,
save onely to the South-West, where it is joyn’d to <i>Guaxata</i>, its farther and
more Easterly Point looking towards <i>Cuba</i>. The knowledge of, when, and
by whom this Province was discover’d, is included in that of <i>New Spain</i>, of which
some will have it to be a part. The whole Province contains in compass nine hundred
Miles or more, and lies between eighteen and twenty two Degrees of Northern
Latitude, or thereabouts, the Air somewhat hot, and the Soil not altogether
so fertile as some other parts of <i>New Spain</i> are; but in recompence thereof the
People are so much the more industrious, living for the most part by Handicraft
Trades. Neither is it altogether unstor’d with Corn and divers sorts of Fruits, besides
what it hath of Fowl and Beasts, as Geese, Hens, Deer, <i>&amp;c.</i> particularly it
yieldeth plenty of Wax and Honey, by reason of its frequent Swarms of Bees.
They report some special things of this Province, as namely, that the People of the
Countrey us’d generally, and long before the <i>Spaniards</i> came thither, a certain Ceremony
of Religion, not much unlike to our Baptism, and which they call’d by
a Name that in their Language signifi’d <i>Regeneration</i>, or <i>A Second-Birth</i>; that they
observ’d it so diligently, that few or none amongst them omitted to initiate themselves
by it, believing, that thereby the Seeds and Ground-work of all Goodness
was laid in them, and that they were fortifi’d by it against the assaults and temptations
of evil Spirits; that after they were three or four years old, till they came to
twelve, they usually thus Wash’d and Baptiz’d themselves; and that none were
permitted amongst them to Marry, that were not first initiated after this manner;
that they chose likewise a solemn Day upon which to do this; and that the Friends
and Relations (especially the Father and Mother) of the Parties to be initiated, as
well as the Parties themselves, always Fasted three days before the said Initiation;
and that a great many of the Natives had a Tradition, or general Report amongst
them, that of ancient time this Province of <i>Jucatan</i> was possess’d and cultivated by
a certain People which came thither from the East, after a tedious long wanderring,
and many hardships endur’d at Sea, having escap’d the Hands of their Enemies
onely through the power of the Deity they worshipp’d; who help’d them,
and made them to pass securely, even through the Waves of the Sea. All which, if
true, seems not a little to confirm the Report which goeth for currant in the <i>Welsh</i>
Chronicles, of one <i>Madoc ap Owen</i>, the Son of <i>Guineth</i>, a Prince of that Countrey,
who is said to have fall’n upon a far Countrey this way in his Travels; which he
lik’d so well, that having secur’d to his Companions their safe abode there during
his absence, he return’d himself into <i>Wales</i> for more Men; and that he transported
thither as many as he could carry in ten Barques full fraught. This he is said to have
done about the Year of our Lord 1170. but neither he nor any of his Men were
ever heard of since; and the success of the Expedition, it seems, little enquir’d after
by the <i>Welsh</i>. However, the Relation seems not altogether incredible.</p>

<p class='c010'>The chief Towns of the Province are, 1. <i>Merida</i>, in the Navel of the Countrey,
and the Seat of the Governor, twelve Leagues distant from the Sea on either side.
2. <i>Valladolidt</i>, thirty Leagues distant from <i>Merida</i>. 3. <i>Campeche</i>, a great Town, consisting
of about three thousand Houses or more, when first conquer’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>;
who found such Monuments of Art and Industry in it, as did clearly argue,
that the Place had been once possess’d by some People that were not barbarous. It
is now call’d <i>St. Francisco</i>, and was surpriz’d in the Year 1596. by Captain <i>Parker</i>,
an  <i>English</i>-man, who took the Governor himself and some other Persons of Quality
with him, together with a Ship richly laden with Gold and Silver, besides other
Commodities of good value. 4. <i>Tabasco</i>, by the <i>Spaniard</i> now call’d <i>Villa de Nuestra
Sennora de Victoria</i>, and commonly <i>Victoria</i> onely, in memory, as ’tis thought, of the
first great Victory which <i>Cortez</i> obtain’d over these People at the Battel of <i>Potonchan</i>,
as hath been said. 5. <i>Cintla.</i> 6. <i>Potonchan.</i> 7. <i>Salamanca.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>All along the Coast of this Countrey there lie certain Islands, some within the
Bay or Gulph call’d <i>Honduras</i>, pertaining to the next Province, as 1. <i>La Zarza.</i>
2. <i>La  Desconescida.</i> 3. <i>Vermeia.</i> 4. <i>Los Negrillos</i>; and some without it, as 1. <i>Zaratan.</i>
2. <i>Pantoia.</i> 3. <i>De Mugeres</i>, or <i>The Island of Women</i>; so nam’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>, who at
their first Discovery of these Parts, for a long time together could meet with none
but Women. The chief of them is call’d <i>Acusamil</i>, commonly <i>Cozamul</i>, and is fifteen
Leagues in length, and about five in breadth, and was as it were the Thorow-fare,
or Common Road of the <i>Spaniards</i>, when they first discover’d the Countreys of
<i>New Spain</i>: For first here Landed <i>Ferdinando de Corduba</i>; after him <i>John de Grialva</i>,
and others; and last of all the fortunate <i>Cortez</i>. It is now call’d <i>St. Crux</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its Situation and Bounds.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Guatimala</i> stretcheth to the <i>Isthmus</i>, or Neck of Land, which, as we said, joineth
the Northern and Southern parts of the <i>New World</i> together.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey is bounded Northward with the <i>Peninsula</i> of <i>Jucatan</i>
abovesaid, and part of the Gulph or Bay of <i>Honduras</i>; on the South, with <i>Mare del
Zur</i>; on the East and South-East, it hath <i>Castella Aurea</i>; and on the West, <i>New Spain</i>.
The length of it lieth upon the Coast of <i>Mare del Zur</i>, and is said to be little less than
three hundred Leagues; but the breadth not half so much, and in some places very
narrow. It is generally a fertile and good Countrey in all respects, but especially
abounding in Cattel and good Pastures; it is subdivided into seven inferior Provinces
or Countreys, which are 1. <i>Chiapa.</i> 2. <i>Verapaz.</i> 3. <i>Honduras.</i> 4. <i>Nicaragua.</i>
5. <i>Veragua.</i> 6. <i>Costa Rica</i>; and 7. <i>Guatimala</i>, specially so call’d: all differing in
Language and Customs one from another.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Bishoprick (as it is now call’d) of <i>Chiapa</i> is border’d on the West with <i>New
Spain</i>; on the East with <i>Vera Paz</i>; and on the South with <i>Mare del Zur</i>. It is a
Countrey much shaded with Woods, and those replenish’d with many fair and
goodly Trees, of divers sorts, and of the largest size, as Oaks, Pines, Cedar, Myrtle,
and Cypress-Trees, besides others which yield them a good kind of Rozen, precious
Gums, <i>&amp;c.</i> also several sorts of Balsom, as white, red, green, and black, not onely
pleasant to the Scent, but an excellent Remedy for all manner of green Wounds:
the best of it drops out of the cut Bodies of the Trees; and the worst is press’d out
of the Wood and Leaves.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Trees and Plants.</div>

<p class='c010'>There are also proper to this Countrey several other kinds of Trees and Plants,
as that whose Fruit tastes like Pepper and Cloves, being of a great heighth; a
Tree whose Leaves cure all ulcerated Sores, or the bitings of any poysonous
Beast.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is a sort of Cabbage call’d <i>Ilantas</i>, which grows to the heighth of a Tree,
so that Birds make their Nests in them; they are eaten likewise like other common
Cabbages.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is also an Herb with narrow Leaves, which is no sooner touch’d, but it
shrinks up to nothing; but at the going away of those which touch it, it obtains
its former vigour.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Birds.</div>

<p class='c010'>Here are likewise Quails, Ducks, Geese, Pheasants, Parrots, Turtle-Doves, Pigeons,
and the like, in great abundance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amongst the several sorts of Falcons which breed in this Countrey, there is one
sort which hath one Foot proper to its kind, the other like that of a Goose; it feeds
on Fish along the Rivers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Bird <i>Toto-Queztall</i>, which is somewhat smaller than a Pigeon, with green
Feathers and a long Tail, is taken onely for its Tail, which when the <i>Indians</i> have
pull’d out, they let the Bird fly again, there being a Law amongst them, that whosoever
kills one of them, is to suffer death.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Cranes here are of a dark Gray; the biggest of them have a tuft of Feathers
like a Crown upon their Heads.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Birds.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Birds <i>Guacamayes</i>, which are red and blue, are like a <i>Peruan</i> Goose.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Beasts.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, the Countrey yields brave Horses, Goats, Sheep, Rabbets, and Foxes;
also wild Dogs, Leopards, Lyons, and Tygers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The wild Hogs which breed here have their Navels on their Backs, and have
no Tails, they smell exceeding strong, and feed together in great Companies.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Taquatrin</i>, a certain Beast proper to those Parts, hath a Bag under its Belly,
in which it generally carries seven or more young ones, and hath also a bald Tail;
it creeps into Houses in the Night to steal Hens.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here is also a certain Beast (whose Name we find not) about the bigness of a
Rabbet, and like a Rat, and carries its young ones on its back whensoe’re it comes
abroad.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Serpents, which are very numerous here, trouble the Inhabitants exceedingly,
especially near the Village <i>Ecatepeque</i>, where there are such an abundance
on two little Hills, that none dares approach them; some of them are very poysonous,
for if touch’d with a Stick, the Poyson runs up the same: and whoever are
anointed with the Blood of a dead Serpent, die a lingring Death. <i>John de Laet</i> relates,
that the <i>Indians</i> took one which carried thirty young ones, which being a
Finger long, crep up and down immediately; and the old one, being above twenty
Foot long, serv’d the Natives for Venison.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amongst other Beasts is also the <i>Teuthlacokauhqui</i>, or <i>Fortress of the Serpents</i>;
it hath a Head like an Adder, thick Belly, glittering Scales, a black Back, sprinkled
with white Crosses; at its Tail there grows yearly a Bone, with which it makes a
noise when it stirs; its poysonous Teeth destroy those which are bit therewith in
twenty four Hours, unless the part which is wounded be held in the Earth so long
till the pain be over. Notwithstanding the noise, terrible aspect, and gestures of this
Animal, the <i>Indian</i> Hunters make nothing to take the same by the Tail, and wrap
it up in Linnen, and carrying it home make it tame. It is able to live a whole Year
without either Meat or Drink; its Head when cut off grows to the bigness of a
Man’s Thigh in ten days time.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>No less resolute are the Indians in taking the <i>Ibitobaca</i>, which is an Ell long, of a
crimson Colour, full of black and white Specks, the Bones whereof they wear
about their Necks in stead of Chains.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Serpent <i>Iquanna</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Iquanna</i> is a Serpent which doth no manner of hurt, though terrible to look
upon to those which know it not, having a Bag under its Chin, a glittering Comb
on its Head, and on its Back sharp Bones, which stand like a Saw, and a long Tail:
It lays fifty Eggs at a time as big as Acorns, of a very good taste, and fit to eat when
boyl’d: It also lives both in the Water and on the Land.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Baboons.</div>

<p class='c010'>Here are also many Baboons, which are big and heavy, with ugly Heads, short
Legs like a Man, and Tails standing upwards; they eat all sorts of Fruit, but
chiefly covet after Wine and Bread; and are so lascivious, that they often set
upon Women: The Females generally bring forth two, one Male, and the other
Female. There is also another sort, whose Skins, being red, are full of little
Spots.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ancient Inhabitants of <i>Chiapa</i> (divided into the <i>Chiapaneca</i>’s, the <i>Zeques</i>, the
<i>Zeltates</i>, and the <i>Quelenes</i>) are very Civil and Witty, also skilful in Painting, Singing,
Breaking of Horses, and many other Trades.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and Villages of Note.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Places of more principal note in this Countrey, inhabited by the <i>Spaniards</i>,
are 1. <i>Ciudad Real</i>, pleasantly seated in the midst of a round Vale or Plain, and almost
encompass’d with Hills representing the form of an Amphitheatre; also at
the Foot of one which stands in the midst of the rest, the City is built. It is a City
specially Priviledg’d by the King of <i>Spain</i>, having a Court of Justice, Cathedral,
and <i>Dominican</i> Cloyster; of a pure and temperate Air, and the Countrey round
about plentifully abounding both in Corn and Fruit, onely somewhat too cold to
produce Lemmons and Oranges; but for Pears, Apples, Peaches, Quinces, Cherries,
and the like, they grow here in great abundance.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Chiapa</i>, which giveth Name to the Valley aforesaid; It is a Bishop’s See, and
famous, if but for one of its Prelates, <i>viz.</i> <i>Bartholomeo de las Casas</i>, of the Order of
<i>Predicants</i>, who was Bishop of this City, and his Memory justly precious amongst
the poor <i>Americans</i> at this day, for his Charity towards them, and for the stout and
zealous opposition which he made against the <i>Spaniards</i> cruel and inhumane dealings
with the Natives at the beginning of their Conquests: by which at last, notwithstanding
much difficulty and resistance made by interested Persons of the other
Side, he procur’d them liberty, and an Edict from the Emperor in favor of them;
whereby they were declar’d to be a Free People, and not Slaves, and the <i>Spaniards</i>
forbidden to use them any longer as such, or to force them to any kind of Labour
against their wills, or otherwise than by agreement with them, which Liberty they
enjoy to this day; and though the <i>Spaniards</i> are said to give them very small Wages
in some places, and for their Work in their Sugar-Mills (which is no small Labor)
not above five <i>Reyals</i>, or Two shillings six pence a Week, for the Maintenance of
themselves, their Wives and Children, yet by reason it is with Consent, and in a
Countrey where all things are plentiful and cheap, their Condition is much better
than it was, and the favor which that good Bishop did them, never to be forgotten.
It is at present a great and populous City, and lieth almost in the mid-way betwixt
the Cities of <i>Mexico</i> and <i>Guatimala</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>St. Bartholomews</i>, in the Countrey of the <i>Quelenes</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>Tecpatlan</i>, the chief of twenty five Villages, said to belong to the <i>Zoques</i>.
Here the <i>Dominicans</i> have another Cloyster.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Zeltates</i> possess a fruitful Countrey, have thirteen Villages planted with
Trees that yield <i>Cochenile</i>, being under a Common-wealth Government.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>The chief Place of the <i>Quelenes</i> is <i>Copanavatzla</i>, where there is good Cheese, and
store of brave Cattel: The River <i>Chiepa</i> gliding through the midst thereof, loseth it
self in the Northern Ocean. In this part of the Country are Beasts not unlike Apes,
with long Tails, which they wind about the Legs of those whom they find swimming
and so pull them under Water; wherefore they that go to Swim take Axes
along with them, to cut off their Tails.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Water of the River <i>Blanco</i> is clear and wholsom, running for the most part
through Rocky Grounds, which nevertheless are overspread with Trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the highest Ground of <i>Chiapa</i>, a League and a half from the City <i>Reall</i>, spring
clear Fountains, whose Water ebbs and flows every six hours.</p>

<p class='c010'>Near the Village call’d <i>Afixa</i> is one which runs three years together, though in
the driest Season, and is dry three years, though it Rain never so much.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not far from the Village <i>Cinacatan</i> is another Spring, whose Water cures several
Sicknesses, but kills all Birds and Beasts which drink of the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here are likewise divers Baths.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Rivers which run out of the Valley <i>Chiapa</i>, fall into two great Pits.</p>

<p class='c010'>Near the Village <i>Bartholomew</i>, in the Province <i>Quelenes</i>, is a strange Cavern, out
of which by the throwing of a stone into the same, are heard mighty noises like
claps of Thunder.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not far from the Village <i>Chicomucolo</i>, appears a Cavern, in which is a great Plain
on one side, and a standing Lake, whose Water is like Sand, on the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spaniards</i>, if they wanted not Slaves, might dig good store of Gold, Silver,
Copper, Lead, Tin, and Quicksilver, out of the Mynes on the Mountain <i>Ecatepeck</i>,
which is in nine Leagues compass: The Wind blows so strong after Sun-rising,
that no Man is able to travel for it, but in the Night.</p>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Bounds.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Vera Paz</i>, or <i>The Countrey of True Peace</i>, was so nam’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>, as they
say, because it was never conquer’d by the Sword, but reduc’d to Obedience
onely by the Preaching of the <i>Dominican</i> Fryers. It is bounded on the
West and South-West with <i>Chiapa</i>; on the East with some part of <i>Guatimala</i> and
<i>Honduras</i>; and on the North with <i>Jucatan</i>. It contains about thirty Leagues in
length, and almost as much in breadth, being a woody and mountainous Countrey
for the most part, yet well distinguish’d with Valleys and lower Ground. It is
much subject to Rain, which ’tis said to have for nine Moneths of the Year almost
continually; by reason whereof the Countrey, being otherwise hot, is much annoy’d
with a kind of <i>Mosquit</i>, or great sort of Gnats, which spoil the Fruit very
much, and are otherwise not a little trouble to the People. Moreover, there happen
oftentimes terrible Earthquakes and Storms, with Thunder and Lightning.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Commodities of the Countrey.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chief Commodities of this Countrey, are a kind of Amber, which some call
<i>Liquid Amber</i>, which drops from divers of their Trees, and is said to be a Commodity
very precious, and of much use; <i>Mastick</i>, <i>Sanguis Draconis</i>, <i>Gum Anime</i>, <i>Sarsaparilla</i>,
<i>China-Wood</i>, and divers other Medicinal Drugs, which it affordeth in great
plenty. The Woods afford a sweet smell, and the Trees in the same grow a wonderful
heighth.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Canes which grow here, being a hundred Foot long, and proportionably
thick, serve for Timber.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>There is also a hard Wood call’d <i>Iron-Wood</i>, either from its hardness or colour, or
both, which never rots.</p>

<p class='c010'>The abundance of Flowers which grow here afford nutriment to innumerable
swarms of Bees, which are about the bigness of small Flies. Their Honey, which
is somewhat tart, they hide in the Roots of Trees, or in the Earth. Another sort,
which is made by the Wasps, bereaves those that taste of their Senses.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Beasts.</div>

<p class='c010'>The noted’st Beast in this Countrey is the <i>Danta</i>, which resembles a Mule, hath
no Horns, but Ash-colour’d long Hair, short Neck, hanging Ears, thin Legs, with
three Claws before and two behind, long Head, narrow Forehead, little Eyes, a
Nose hanging over its Mouth, little Tail, sharp Teeth, and a Skin which is six
Fingers thick, and scarce penetrable by any Weapon. This Beast is taken in Traps,
Holes, or else with Dogs, which he often kills when hunted towards the Water.
They say that this Beast taught Men first to Let-blood; for if it be too full of
Blood, it pricks it self against a sharp Cane, and stops up the Orifice again very
carefully. The Flesh thereof is good Meat, as also that of the <i>Ross</i>-Lyons, which
in the day-time sleep on a high Tree, where they are shot by the <i>Indians</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Tygers are much more dangerous to be taken; yet the <i>Indians</i> Hunting
them, eat them in stead of Beef; and also through all <i>New Spain</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Bears, which make the Ways very dangerous to travel, have black frizled
Hair, broad Tails, Feet like Mens Hands: but since the <i>Indians</i> have made use of
Guns, which they learn’d from the <i>Spaniards</i>, they have much lessen’d the number
both of Bears and Tygers.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are likewise many Leopards, Apes, and wild Goats (whose Skins serve the
Natives for Drums) Hogs, and <i>Armadillo</i>’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amongst their Fowls, are Eagles and Parrots.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey is so well stor’d with Water, that in three Leagues space are
above thirty Rivulets, and as many Fountains.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Medicinal Plants.</div>

<p class='c010'>On the Mountains grow great quantities of <i>Sarsaparilla</i>, <i>Mechoacan</i>, and the <i>China-Root</i>,
which being yellowish hath several Saffron-colour’d Knobs on the top. The
<i>Sarsaparilla</i> grows with many Stalks, creeping along over the Ground; the Body
thereof is tough and full of Prickles, the Leaves broad and sharp at the ends, and
are of a bluish colour on one side, and green on the other, and bear Clusters of
Flowers, which close like Buds, and are first green, next vermilion-red, and lastly
blackish: within are two hard Stones, which inclose a white Kernel, by the <i>Indians</i>
call’d <i>Juapecanga</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Bay <i>Golfo Dulce</i>, which pours its muddy Water into the Sea, feeds the great
Fish <i>Monati</i>, and a great number of Crocodiles.</p>

<p class='c010'>Several Rivers abounding with Fish fall also into the same, having their Banks
set all along with Trees, in whose Boughs, joyn’d together on the top, those sort
of Birds make their Nests which prey on Fish.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Women in this place are much shorter Liv’d than the Men, so that there are
often thirty Widowers to one Widow. Women with Child are Deliver’d by
themselves in the High-way; and from thence they go to the next River to wash
themselves and the Child.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Places of note.</div>

<p class='c010'>As for any Towns or Places of much Traffick or Note, inhabited by the <i>Spaniards</i>,
we find not any nam’d, save onely <i>St. Augustines</i>; near unto which there is
said to be a Cave and Fountain within Ground, which converts the Water that falleth
into it out of several lesser Springs, into a kind of Alabaster or Stone, perfectly
white, and fashions it likewise into Pillars, Statues, and other artificial Forms
of very curious Workmanship, as <i>Laet</i> reporteth.</p>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Bounds.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Honduras</i> hath on the South, <i>Guatimala</i> abovesaid; on the West, a certain Bay,
or Arm of the Sea, which they call <i>Golfo Dulce</i>, from the abundance of
fresh Waters which run into it from all Parts; on the North and North-East,
the <i>Atlantick Ocean</i>; and somewhat to the South-East, <i>Nicaragua</i>. It contains
in length, <i>viz.</i> from East to West, Coasting along upon the Sea, about a hundred
and fifty Leagues, and in breadth eighty. The Countrey is rich both in Corn and
Pasturage, being said to be very much advantag’d that way by the constant overflowings
of the Rivers, which are very many, about <i>Michaelmass</i>-time, and which
the People order so well, that they water their Gardens, and exceedingly fertilize
the whole Champain, or lower part of the Grounds by them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fruitful Valleys of this Countrey were anciently very well inhabited, till
vast multitudes of the Natives were destroy’d by the <i>Spaniards</i> Cruelties, of which
the Bishop <i>Bartholomeo de las Casas</i>, in his Letter to the Emperor <i>Charles</i> the Fifth,
gives this Relation:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cruelties of the <i>Spaniards</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>“The young Children (saith he) they murder’d, beating out their Brains against
the Stones; the Kings and Princes of the Countrey they either scorch’d to death,
or threw them to the Dogs to be torn in pieces; the poor People they drove into
their Houses, and then set them on fire; those that remain’d were condemn’d
to the greatest slavery imaginable, being us’d in stead of Mules and Horses, and
having greater Burdens laid upon them than they were able to carry, insomuch
that thousands of them fell down dead under them; some out of despair running
into the Woods were famish’d, after they had kill’d and eat their Wives and
Children for Hunger. In this one Province onely they massacred above twenty
hundred thousand Men, and amongst others, Persons of Quality, which had civilly
Entertain’d them: nay, they tortur’d the poor innocent Natives all the
ways they could possibly invent, onely to know of them where their Gold lay;
particularly <i>Diego de Valasco</i> spar’d none that ever fell into his hands; insomuch
that in a Moneths time above ten thousand were slain by him: He hang’d thirteen
Noble-men, to twelve of whom he gave the Denomination of <i>The twelve
Apostles</i>; and the chiefest of them he call’d in a derision, <i>Jesus Christ</i>. Some they
suffer’d to starve to death, with their Heads compress’d between the cloven Barks
of wild Vines; some also they buried alive, and leaving onely their Heads to
appear above Ground, bowl’d Iron Bullets at them, and forc’d them to eat one
another; besides infinite other hellish Cruelties, too horrid and dreadful to be
recounted.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Commodities of the Countrey.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey produces much <i>Maiz</i>, Wheat, Honey, and great <i>Calabashes</i>, from
whence the first Discoverers call’d that Sea <i>Golfo de las Ybueras</i>, because they met with
abundance of <i>Calabashes</i>, floating on the Water, which at <i>Santo Domingo</i> bear the
Name of <i>Ybueras</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey is water’d by three Rivers, the first <i>Chamalucom</i>, which glides by
the City <i>San Pedro</i>; the second <i>Ulva</i>, inhabited on both Shores; the third <i>Haguaro</i>,
the Grounds adjacent to which would prove very fruitful, were the Inhabitants
not too lazy. In stead of a Plough they use a long Pole, with two crooked
Staves at the end, one bent downwards and the other upwards, with which they
cut and turn the Earth. The Natives feed on several Roots, Flesh, and Vermine.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>At their Feast they make themselves Drunk with a Drink made of Honey,
Noble-men heretofore onely drinking the Liquor of <i>Cacao</i>; of late it is common,
and made by all People, though never so mean. They speak several Languages,
the chiefest whereof is that of the <i>Chontales</i>, a salvage People. They divide their
Year, call’d <i>Joalar</i>, that is, <i>Passing</i>, into eighteen Moneths, and each Moneth into
twenty Days. They formerly measur’d the Year by the Nights, and began the Year
forty days sooner than the <i>Europeans</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>New Valladolid.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The Towns in this Province are 1. <i>New Vallodolid</i>, by the <i>Indians</i> nam’d <i>Comayagua</i>,
lying in a pleasant Valley under a temperate Climate. The Cattel brought hither
from <i>Spain</i> increase exceedingly. The Silver-Mynes are also so well stor’d, that they
keep the Melting-house in the Town always employ’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Governor of this Place hath his Residence next to the Treasury-Chamber.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Anno 1588.</i> the Bishop’s See was translated hither from <i>Truxillo</i>: Nineteen years
before which <i>Francisco de Monteio</i> sent his Lieutenant <i>Alphonso de Cacenes</i> thither, to
build a Village half way between the Southern and Northern Ocean; who accordingly
erected the Town <i>Santa Maria de Camoyagua</i>, near a River Navigable for <i>Canoos</i>,
which disembogues in <i>Puerto de Cavallos</i>. The remaining part of the Way to
the Haven <i>Fonseca</i> being passable for Carrs (which was a means to prevent many
Inconveniences which us’d to happen to Travellers on the Way between <i>Panama</i> and
<i>Nombre de Dios</i>) the <i>Spanish</i> King was so much concern’d at the first proposal hereof,
that he sent the famous Surveyor <i>Baptista Antonello</i> thither, and he<a id='t230'></a> rather, because
he received information, that the new Way, along which they carried the Merchandise
from <i>Peru</i>, <i>Mexico</i>, and other Countreys along the South Sea, lay very pleasantly,
by reason of the brave Vineyards, Corn-Fields, Fruit-Trees, Pastures,
Streams abounding with Fish, Herds of Deer, and Cony-Warrens; yet <i>Antonello</i>
meeting with many troubles, would not undertake the Business.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>New Valladolid</i> is adorn’d with a great Church, a Cloyster, belonging to the
Monks <i>De la Merced</i>, and handsom Streets.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Gratias a Dios.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>2. Thirty Leagues Westward from this City lies another call’d <i>Gratias a Dios</i>, begun
by Captain <i>Gabriel de Royas</i>, <i>Anno 1530.</i> that so he might be near the Gold-Mines:
But because the Natives kept the new Inhabitants in continual alarm, and daily
Storm’d the unfinished Fortifications, <i>Royas</i> was necessitated to leave off building
any farther, the rather, because none came to his assistance from the neighboring
Garrison.</p>

<p class='c010'>Six years after <i>Gonzales de Alvarado</i> undertook this Work, and built the City on a
Rocky Mountain; which, though otherwise barren, produc’d lusty Horses and
strong Mules.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>St. Pedro.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>San Pedro</i>, though lying under a hot and unwholsom Climate, us’d formerly to
be a brave City of Trade; but it is gone much to decay since <i>Golfo Dolce</i> hath been
discover’d, because from that Bay the Commodities are carried in Barques up into
the Countrey.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Juan de Puerto de Cavallos.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>4. The Village <i>Juan de Puerto de Cavallos</i>, inhabited by Factors and Moors: It receiv’d
that Denomination, because not far from it several Horses were forc’d to be
thrown over-board in a Storm. Though it be but ill fortifi’d, yet it hath an exceeding
large Haven. Captain <i>Christopher Newport</i> arriving here <i>Anno 1591.</i> found
two hundred Houses, and in them a considerable Booty left, notwithstanding four
Ships richly laden had lately set Sail from thence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Six years after <i>Newport</i>, Capt. <i>Ant. Sherly</i> re-took the Place, and leaving the Haven
open for Pyrats, <i>Alphonsus Coriado</i> judg’d it convenient to remove the Trading Place
to <i>Amatique</i>; he built the Village <i>Thomas de Castilla</i>, and fortifi’d the same against all
manner of Assaults.</p>

<i>Joan Gil</i>, is above two Leagues broad, and receives two Rivers, one from each side
of the City: The Stream <i>Quaimarotte</i> flows Eastward, and the River <i>Antonio</i> Westward,
both abounding in Fish. The Countrey round about produces abundance
of all sorts of Provisions, and chiefly abounds in Grapes, which are gather’d
twice a year: Eight days after <i>August</i> they cut their Vines, which afford them ripe
Grapes again in <i>October</i>; they have two Harvests of Corn; also Lemons and
Oranges are very plentiful: The Cattel brought hither from <i>Spain</i> are exceedingly
increas’d to an incredible number.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Truxillo</i> it self lying on a steep Mountain, is defended on that side which respects
the Sea, with a thick Wall of six Foot high; between which and the Haven
are many brambly Bushes, which prevent the access to the Wall, onely a narrow
and steep way leading up to the City, which hath a strong Gate, guarded with two
Brass Guns, and sufficiently Fortifi’d to oppose an Enemy. The Eastern Cliff,
which bends before the Haven is call’d <i>Punta la Rye</i>, on which stands a House with
a high Beacon: Beyond the Wall Eastward, near the Haven, is a Ship-yard, before
which stands a large Woodden Cross: The Castle in which the City Store is
kept, joyns to the Wall, near unto which, within the Town appears St. <i>Francis</i>
Church; but the Cathedral call’d <i>Eglesia Major</i>, is seen above all other Buildings:
The Houses cover’d with <i>Palmito</i>-Leaves, have Walls of Pleited Bushes, Plaister’d
over within and without: Behind the City, where it lies open, are exceeding high
Mountains.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Attempts upon this place by the <i>English</i> and <i>Dutch</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Anno 1576.</i> the <i>English</i> falling on this strong Place, carry’d a rich Booty from
thence; after which, Capt. <i>Anth. Sherly</i> and Capt. <i>Will. Parker</i> ventur’d once more on
the same, but being discover’d by the Centinel, were forc’d to Retreat, not without
a considerable loss: When not long after, Captain <i>John Van Hoorn</i> a <i>Hollander</i>, attempting
the same, had much better success; for he Weighing Anchor for <i>Pernambuc</i>,
with four Frigats, three Ketches, and a Sloop, set Sail to <i>Truxillo</i>, where
arriving, lay close before the City with his four Frigats, which fired very fiercely
on the Town; the Inhabitants of which not being idle, kill’d three Men in one
Ship, forc’d her to fall farther off from the Castle: Whilst the Ketches and Sloop
went about a Gun shot Westward beyond the City, towards the River <i>Antonio</i>,
where they Landed two hundred and fifty Soldiers, which march’d with all speed
up the Hill, where the Castle lay which they Scal’d at Noon-day; the Besieged
being provided with seven Guns, shot, and threw Stones continually amongst
them, yet were forc’d to Retreat from the <i>Dutch</i> Hand-granado’s: During the
storm, the Admiral himself Landed, but before he came out of the Boat, the foremention’d
Soldiers had made themselves Masters of the Fort, with the loss of onely
eight Men, and were busie Pillaging all places they came at, and carrying their
gotten Booty to a Watch-house near the Castle on the Shore; when on a sudden
a Fire happen’d in the East part of <i>Truxillo</i>, which increas’d in such a manner, that
in few hours two third parts of the City lay in Ashes; every one then had enough
to do to save themselves, yet for all the haste they made, several <i>Hollanders</i> were
kill’d at the blowing up of the Magazine, and most of the Booty lost by the
Fire; insomuch that they carry’d but two hundred thirty nine Skins, six Bales of
<i>Indigo</i>, eight hundred and twenty Pounds of <i>Sarsaparilla</i>, seven Brass, and three
Iron Guns, four Clocks, and some few trifles with them; having before made an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>agreement for twenty Pound of Silver, with the Governor <i>Joan de Miranda</i>, who
inform’d them, that they had not the least knowledge of the <i>Hollanders</i> Fleet, till
the Evening, when the Beacon on <i>Punta La Rye</i> was fir’d: Moreover, that the City
was inhabited by two hundred <i>Spaniards</i>, and as many more <i>Mulatoes</i> and <i>Moors</i>;
and that the Trade thereof was much gone to decay, because there had been no
Gallies there in two years before.</p>

<h4 id='c232' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. IV.</span><br /> Nicaragua.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation and bounds.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Nicaragua</i> is a County of this Province, border’d Northward with <i>Honduras</i>;
on the East, with the <i>Atlantick Ocean</i>, and part of <i>Veragua</i>; on the South,
with <i>Mare del Zur</i>; and on the West, with <i>Guatimala</i>, being call’d by <i>Diego
Lopez de Salzado</i>, <i>The New Kingdom of</i> Leon, and comprizing several little Territories,
as <i>Nicoya</i>, <i>Nequecheri</i>, <i>Mabyth</i>, <i>Deria</i>, <i>Masaya</i>, <i>Mandigua</i>, <i>Cacoloaque</i>, <i>Cepeoco</i>, <i>Los
Micos</i>, <i>Madira</i>, and the <i>Contales</i>. It hath few Rivers in it, the want whereof is supply’d
by the benefit of a great Lake, in the midst of the Countrey, call’d by the
<i>Spaniards</i>, <i>Laguna de Nicaragua</i>, containing, as is suppos’d, above one hundred
Leagues in compass. It empties it self by the Port of <i>St. Juan</i> into the <i>Atlantick</i> or
North-Sea, but reacheth as far as the South or <i>Mare del Zur</i>, at least within a very
few Leagues; and from whence some <i>Spanish</i> Captains are said to have made a passage,
though with much difficulty, into the Lake, and from thence to the North-Sea.
It is abundantly well stor’d with good Fish, but withal much haunted with
Crocodiles; and the Countrey about it so plentiful in all things, especially Cattel,
Cotten-Wool, Sugars, and all kind of Fruits: Amongst which, the chiefest is the
<i>Zeiba</i>, which is of so great a thickness, that fifteen Men holding Hand in Hand, can
scarce encompass the same. The <i>Callabashes</i> ripen here in fourteen days time: The
Sea along the Coast, breeds Whales and other Sea-Monsters, which are often seen
above Water.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nature of the Inhabitants.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Inhabitants of this Countrey, (except the <i>Chontales</i>, which live on the
Mountains, and maintain their old Salvage Customs) have for the most part
learnt the <i>Spanish</i> Tongue and Manners, and exercise themselves in all sorts of
Arts and Siences, especially in Working of Silver, making of Clothes, Wax-Work,
and the like: From the Mountains they gather Balsom, Liquid-Amber, Turpentine:
They also drive a great Trade in Cotton, Skins, and several sorts of Provisions,
to <i>Panama</i>, and <i>Nombre de Dios</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lake <i>Laguna de Nicaragua</i>, which hath a hundred and seventeen Leagues in
Circumference, and round about inhabited, is by three Leagues of Land separated
from the South-Sea; and discharges its Waters into the River <i>Desaguadero</i>,
which falls into the Northern Ocean. <i>Alphonsus Calera</i>, and <i>Diego Machuca de Zuaso</i>,
were the first that Sail’d out of the foremention’d Lake into the Sea, not without
many dangers, by reason of the great Water-falls, call’d <i>Rondales</i>, which fall into
the River <i>Desaguadero</i>, and forc’d them often times to draw their Barques over the
Land.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cities.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chief City is, 1. <i>Leon</i>, which is surrounded with Woods, and lies close by
the Lake; hath a great Church, five Cloysters belonging to the <i>Monks, de la Mercede</i>,
several Houses for the King’s Officers, and a hundred and twenty thousand Families
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>of <i>Indians</i> which pay Tribute. Three Leagues beyond <i>Leon</i> appears a high spiry
Mountain, from whose top, both Morning and Evening, rises a mighty smoke,
and sometimes casts out great sulphurous Stones over the neighboring Fields, and
on a sudden mighty Flames. A <i>Dominican</i> Monk, in hopes to get some melted Gold
out of its burning Mouth, went up the same with four of his Fraternity, and
carry’d an Iron Chain and a Kettle, which were no sooner let down into the hole,
but they were immediately melted; yet not so discourag’d, they resolv’d to venture
a second time with stronger Materials, which nevertheless had the same, or rather
worse event; for the Fire flew out in such a manner, that the <i>Dominicans</i> sadly
scorch’d, had enough to do to escape with Life, since which none durst presume to
approach the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>But besides the Episcopal City <i>Leon</i>, Erected by <i>Franciscus Fernandez</i>, 2. <i>Granada</i>
acknowledges the same Builder, and lying also on the shore of <i>Laguna de Nicaragua</i>,
is adorn’d with a Castle, Church, and several Sugar-Mills: Not far from it lie
the small Lakes <i>Masaya</i> and <i>Lindiri</i>; the first which is inclos’d between exceeding
high Mountains, covers the Foot of the burning Mountain <i>Masaya</i>; the other falls
into <i>Laguna de Nicaragua</i>, near which is the smoky Mountain <i>Munbacho</i>, surrounded
with Fruit-Trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>&amp;</i> 4. The Towns <i>Jean</i>, and <i>Neuva Segovia</i>, which are not far from thence, are
of little consequence.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <i>Realeio</i>, this is, as it were, the <i>Chattam</i> of <i>America</i>, being a place on the South-Sea,
where the King of <i>Spain</i> hath all his Ships built that are made of <i>American</i> Timber,
and inhabited by few or none but Shipwrights, Mariners, and Men of that
kind of Profession.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <i>&amp;</i> 7. <i>Nicoya</i>, <i>Avarines</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>8. <i>Cartago</i>, forty Leagues distant from <i>Nicoya</i>, and lying almost in the midst of
the <i>Isthmus</i>, or <i>Streight</i> of <i>Darien</i>, equally distant both from the North and South
Sea; on both which it is said likewise to have a convenient Port or Haven for
Shipping.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange manner of Dancing.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spaniards</i>, when first they Landed here, call’d this Countrey <i>Mahomets Paradise</i>,
because of its exceeding Fruitfulness. The <i>Cacao</i> which they use here in stead
of Money, is not unlike the Stone of an Almond. The Inhabitants, in stead of
using a Steel and Flint to strike Fire withal, rub two pieces of Wood together so
long, till one of them is kindled; and burn the Boughs of Pine-Trees in stead of
Candles. Amongst the several Languages which they speak, the <i>Mexican</i> is the chiefest:
Amongst their Recreations, Dancing is principal, which is perform’d after
a very strange manner, for they meet sometimes two or three thousand together,
according to the bigness of the Province, in a spacious Field, which is made
clean before for that purpose: He that leads the Dance goes backward, and with
many strange Gestures, turns himself about, which the rest, following four and four
together in a row, imitate, whilst their <i>Tambores</i> beat on hollow Instruments, and
sing Songs, which are first answer’d by the Ring-leader of the Dance, and then
seconded by the whole Company, each of them waving a Fan or a <i>Callabash</i>,
and being all adorn’d with Plumes of Feathers on their Heads, and Strings with
Shells about their Arms and Legs; they also act several antick Tricks, the one,
the blind Man, the other, the Cripple, one feigns himself to be deaf, the other
makes a wry Mouth, one cries, and another laughs, whilest others drink healths
in <i>Chocolate</i>, which continues till Midnight.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fish <i>Manati</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>A King of this Countrey in former times us’d to feed the Fish <i>Manati</i> with Bread,
in the Lake <i>Guainabo</i>, where it would appear at its being call’d <i>Matto</i>, <i>Matto</i>, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>signifies <i>Noble-minded</i>, and oftentimes carry eight or ten Boys on its Back from one
side of the Lake to the other; but being shot by a <i>Spaniard</i> with an Arrow, never
appear’d again.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is likewise a black Beast in this Countrey call’d <i>Cascu</i>, resembling in some
things a Hog; it hath a hard Skin, little Eyes, open Ears, cloven Feet, short Nose,
and makes such a terrible noise, that it affrights those which hear it.</p>

<p class='c010'>No less strange and wonderful is the Fox-Ape, which hath two Bellies one under
another; in the lowermost of which it carries its Young, which are never brought
into the World till they are able to shift for their own Food. It hath the Body of a
Fox, Feet like a Man’s Hands, and Ears like a Batt.</p>

<p class='c010'>It will not be amiss before we conclude with this Province, to give you a Relation
of the Discourse which hapned <i>Anno 1527.</i> between the <i>Spanish</i> Commander
<i>Francisco de Monteio</i> and the <i>Nicaraguan</i> Casique <i>Alquinotex</i>, who being a hundred and
ten years old, told him, “That before the <i>Spaniards</i> arrival there, great numbers
of his Soldiers perish’d after a strange manner; for after having vomited abundance
of Worms, they fell down dead on a sudden: those that escap’d the Contagion
differing amongst themselves, made two Parties, which twice Engaging
with one another, each of them lost above a hundred and fifty thousand Men.
Yet both these Plagues were no ways to be compar’d to the Slaughter which the
<i>Spaniards</i> had made amongst them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>About the same time an <i>Italian</i>, call’d <i>Hieronymo Bonzo</i>, Lodging with a <i>Nicaraguan</i>
Noble-man that understood the <i>Spanish</i> Tongue, was thus set upon by him:
<i>What do not</i> (<i>Oh</i> Christ) <i>the</i> Christians <i>do! they no sooner get their Foot into an</i> Indian<i>’s
Hut, but they commandingly call for Maiz, Honey, Winter-Clothes, Gold, Silver, and a Woman
to cool their lustful desires: Certainly there is nothing more vicious on Earth</i>. To which
<i>Bonzo</i> gave him this Answer: <i>The wicked</i> Spaniards <i>commit oftentimes unseemly things</i>.
The <i>Indian</i> again suddenly retorted, saying, <i>Where are any such Men to be found as good</i>
Spaniards? <i>I have never known any but wicked Villains.</i> To which <i>Bonzo</i> said, <i>Why
have you made place for them on</i> Nicaragua? Which was thus reply’d to by the Noble-man:
“All People round about took Oath on the first News of the <i>Christians</i> arrival,
to hazard all, and fight to the last Man, before they would be under the
insupportable Yoke, with which they had heard other Countreys were oppress’d
with by them. To which purpose they made ready Bowes, Arrows, Lances,
Stones, Clubs, and other Weapons of War: But when it came to the trial, the
<i>Spanish</i> Horse, of which they had never seen the like, struck such a terror into the
<i>Indians</i>, that they fled, and sent two Agents to <i>Monteio</i> to desire Peace; but their
Design was onely to gain time, that they might gather new Forces, to venture
a second Encounter; which prov’d as fatal to them as the first. Then desiring
Peace once more, they gather’d all that were able to bear Arms, and swore one
to another not to stir a Foot; and withal made a Law, That whosoever did
shrink should be kill’d immediately: But the Women being inform’d hereof,
begg’d that they might rather suffer under the <i>Spanish</i> Yoke, than be torn in pieces
by their Dogs, or kill’d by their Bullets and Swords, alledging, that they were
not able to resist the <i>Spaniards</i>; and entreated them, that if they were resolv’d
to go on with their first Design, they would first send their Wives and Children
to the other World, that so they might not fall into the hands of the merciless
and bloody <i>Christians</i>: Whereupon most Voices judg’d it convenient to
make use of the Opportunity, and to submit to <i>Monteio</i>. But his cruel dealings
made some to contradict that Determination, for which they paid
dearly; for not onely they, but their little Infants, were put to the most cruel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Deaths imaginable; which made many of them also to lay violent hands on
themselves.”</p>

discover’d. The Countrey is for the most part mountainous, and the Soil outwardly
barren, but recompencing all defects with the abundance of its more inward
Wealth, that is to say, in the richness of its Mynes, of which it is said to afford
many, and so inexhaustibly rich and good, that the <i>Spaniards</i> here know no end of

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>This Countrey was conquer’d by <i>Peter de Alvarado</i>, <i>Anno 1525.</i> It is, by reason of its

onely good Pasturage, and many great Herds of Cattel, but likewise good store of

are generally tractable and well dispos’d, both in point of Religion and civil
Government.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns of note.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Towns of chief note are 1. <i>Guatimala</i>, now call’d <i>St. Jago de Guatimala</i> since the
re-building thereof; for about the Year 1586. it was almost buried in Ashes, which
one of the neighboring Mountains, for the space of six Moneths together, continually
belch’d out in such fearful quantities, that many People were slain,
the old City deserted, and a new one built in another place. The day before this
sad Accident hapned, the neighboring Mountains were observ’d to shiver, and a
great noise was heard from under Ground; which amazing the <i>Indians</i>, the news
thereof was carried to the Bishop, <i>Franciscus Moroquin</i>, who narrowly enquiring
into the Causes of these Accidents, and what they might portend, found that
a sad Event would suddenly follow, as accordingly it did; for about midnight
on the eighth of <i>August, Anno 1541.</i> such a mighty store of Rain fell, as if
the Clouds had been all dissolv’d into Water, which came rowling from the
Rocky Mountains with such violence, that it wash’d down great Stones, which
carried on by the strength of the Water against the Houses, beat them down; and
none could have seen how they were ruin’d, had not the mighty flashes of Lightning,
follow’d by terrible claps of Thunder, lighted the Night. Some instantly
deserting this miserable place, fled up into the Countrey, and there built a new
<i>Guatimala</i> (as above-mention’d) sur-nam’d <i>St. Jago</i>, three Leagues farther towards
the East, in a Valley through which flow two Rivers, between two <i>Vulcans</i>, or
smoaking Mountains, which sometimes vomit forth terrible Flames, mix’d with
dreadful Thunder-claps, Ashes, and great Stones, insomuch that the Ground all
about it, which is exceeding fruitful, seems to move. There are many of these
<i>Vulcans</i> in several parts of <i>America</i>, as namely at <i>Arequipa</i> in the Kingdom of <i>Peru</i>,
at <i>Puebla de los Angelos</i>, in the Province of <i>Tlascalla</i> abovesaid, a Mountain of so great
heighth, that they are fain to go little less than thirty Leagues turning and winding
before they can reach the top of it, and others in several other places. They are generally
Mountains of great heighth, and running sharp upwards, but at the top
containing some quantity of plain and level Ground; in the midst whereof is a Pit
or Hole, out of which abundance of Smoak and fiery Sparkles are vomited almost
continually, and so deep, that they are suppos’d for the most part to reach to the
very bottom of the Mountain. Some of these <i>Vulcans</i> cast forth neither Fire nor
Smoak, yet are clearly seen to burn at the bottom with a quick Fire, and which is
so extreamly hot, that it instantly melteth Iron, or any other Metal that is cast into
it, as by experience hath been found: for some conceiving that the Matter which
maintains these Fires within the Bowels of the Earth so long together, can be nothing
else but melted Gold, have endeavor’d several times to extract and draw it
forth in certain Vessels of Iron and Brass, which they have caus’d to be let down
into the bottom of the <i>Vulcan</i> or Pit, by long Iron Chains made on purpose: but,
as we said, the extream heat and force of the Fire below always melted them before
they could be drawn up again, and by that means hath rendred all such Attempts
frustrate. In this Town, now call’d <i>St. Jago</i>, reside above six hundred <i>Spanish</i> Commanders,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>and more than twenty five thousand <i>Indians</i> which pay Tribute. They
have also a brave Church and two Cloysters, one belonging to the <i>Dominicans</i>, and
another to the Order <i>La Merced</i>, and likewise a noble Hospital. Not far from
thence is a place call’d <i>Yzaleos</i>, where there are Orchards of <i>Cacoa</i> two Leagues in
square, each of them producing yearly as much as fifty thousand Men are able
to carry. They reckon the <i>Cacao</i> by <i>Contels</i>, which is the number of four hundred;
by <i>Xequipiles</i>, of eight thousand; and by <i>Carga</i>’s, of twenty four thousand. In this
County is a Mountain, whose top smoaking continually consumes by degrees, and
oftentimes covers the neighboring Countrey with Ashes. The Water which flows
from the same differs very much, for some of it is wholsom and fit to drink; some
foul and stinking, and some turns Wood, if laid in the same, to Stone. Here is
also the Beast whose Head is highly esteem’d for the <i>Bezoar</i>-Stone, which it carries
in the same. Here is likewise a little Bear, which in stead of a Mouth, hath a
long Nose with a round Hole in it, and a hollow Tongue, with which it sucks
Honey, and disturbs the Nests of Pismires. The Women in this Place make curious
Earthen Ware, colour’d either red or black with the Mud of two several
Brooks. The <i>Indians</i> call’d the boyling Fountains in this County <i>Hell</i>, because they
bubble up a Bowes-shot high, and make the River <i>Caliente</i>, which, notwithstanding
it hath pass’d half a League through a wide Channel, retains its exceeding
heat. Not far from it lies a Stone, which having a Crack in the middle, sends
forth a thick Damp, and against bad Weather a thundering noise. On the Mountains
grow exceeding large Trees, especially Oak. Here Pismires which are of an
extraordinary bigness, are brought to Market amongst other Provisions.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>St. Salvador</i>, forty Leagues distant from <i>Guatimala</i> Eastward, and seated upon
the River <i>Guacapa</i>, and having about it a small Territory, which by some is accounted
a distinct Countrey or Province.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>Acaputla</i>, a Town of the Natives, situated at the Mouth of the River, and being
as it were, the Port-Town to <i>St. Salvador</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>Trinidad</i>, a Town of great resort, being the greatest Empory and Place of
Traffick for all sorts of Commodities, betwixt the People of <i>New Spain</i> and those

South Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <i>Xeres de la Frontera</i>, on the Confines of this Province, towards the Borders of
<i>Nicaragua</i>, besides several Villages which we shall have occasion to mention.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the middle of a Lake within this Territory is an Island, on which the <i>Indians</i>
had a Tradition, That a Man no sooner set his Foot but he died immediately:
Which Opinion of theirs was chang’d when the <i>Spaniards</i> went thither in Boat-fulls
and return’d safe again, with Relation that they had seen a large Stone Image, resembling
a Woman; before which lay the Ashes and Bones of slain People.</p>

<p class='c010'>Round about the Village <i>Guaymoco</i> grow great Balsom-Trees, which afford
Timber of fifty five Foot long. From this Village leads a Way to the City <i>Salvador</i>,
near which the fore-mention’d River <i>Guachapa</i> runs with so many windings,
that the Traveller is forc’d to cross the same several times before he can come to
the Foot of a Mountain which formerly cast out terrible Flames; but now the
combustible Matter being consum’d, there appears onely a great Hole on the top,
with Ashes in a large compass round about it. At the Foot of the same are two Pits,
one of which smoaks continually in such a manner, that it stifles all those that approach
it; yet the Mountain is well overspread with Cedars and Pine-Trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>Three Leagues farther lies the Village <i>Nixapa</i>; and not far from thence the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Hill <i>Elmal Pais</i>, which consists of great Stones and Ashes, wonderfully mixt together:
No less wonderful is a Brook which flows in the Night till Morning, and
then sinks into the Ground: And in the Countrey <i>Choluteca</i> is another, which hides
it self at Noon, and appears again towards Night. The Cavern which formerly
produc’d Fire and Smoke, now affords good Water to the Village <i>Curcatan</i>, and
City <i>Salvador</i>: Near the Village <i>Yztepegve</i> are five Springs, which cast up Allom
and Sulphur. The Natives <i>Chontales</i> which speak several Languages, flock to the
Village <i>Mimilla</i>, to make Offerings; not far from hence are two Pits, one of
which is full of boyling Water, and the other as cold as Ice: Moreover, <i>Cocori</i> lies
near a high Mountain, on the top of which is a very turbulent Lake.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Havens.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chiefest Haven of this Countrey, which lies along the South-Sea, is <i>Bahia
de Fonseca</i>, Discover’d by <i>Gonsalves Davila</i>, <i>Anno 1522.</i> and so nam’d from <i>Joan Rodrigas
de Fonseca</i>, Bishop of <i>Burgos</i>; In the middle thereof appears the Island <i>Petronella</i>,
with nine others, of which four are inhabited by <i>Indians</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The good conveniency of the Haven <i>Fonseca</i>, induc’d some of the <i>Spaniards</i> to
make a new Passage from the side of the Southern Ocean, to the Northern, <i>viz.</i>
from <i>Panama</i> to <i>Nombre de Dios</i>, designing it to reach from the said Haven <i>Fonseca</i>,
unto <i>Puerto de Carellos</i>, which are distant one from the other forty five Leagues;
most of it good way, except some over-grown Mountains, which might be made
passable with little trouble; to which purpose they built the Town <i>Buena Esperanca</i>,
yet nevertheless the Work remain’d unprosecuted.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are moreover reckon’d as appertaining to <i>Guatimala</i>, the small Provinces
<i>Soconusco</i>, <i>Suchitepec</i>, and <i>Chilulteca</i>, the chief of them being <i>Soconusco</i>, to which belongs
the Town of <i>Gevetlan</i>, where the <i>Spanish</i> Governor hath his Residence; the
rest seem to be onely small Territories about Towns of the same Name, in like
manner as St. <i>Salvador</i>, and St. <i>Miguel</i> before-mention’d.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>New Spain</i>, the chiefest part of the Northern <i>America</i>, reckons in length from
the East-Point of <i>Yucatan</i>, to the place where <i>Mechoacon</i> juts against <i>Guadalajara</i>
three hundred and sixty Leagues; and in breadth from the
Northern parts of <i>Panucos</i>, to the Southern Ocean, a hundred and eighty Leagues;
besides a great part which lies to the Northward, behind inaccessable Mountains
and Wildernesses; inhabited by the <i>Tepecuaenes</i>, <i>Guachucules</i>, <i>Cacatequas</i>, <i>Tecaxquines</i>,
and others; and was, before the <i>Spaniards</i> Conquer’d and Dismember’d it, much
larger than now it is; for as much as it comprehended the whole Province of
<i>New-Gallicia</i>, and reach’d from the furthest Point of the <i>Peninsula</i> of <i>Jucatan</i> Southward
as far as <i>New-Biscay</i>, and the Confines of <i>California</i> Northward; containing
in length seven hundred Leagues and more, and about half as much in breadth:
But since the Conquest by <i>Hernando Cortez</i> and his Followers, the whole Countrey
of <i>New-Gallicia</i> is taken from it, and made a distinct Government or <i>Audiencia</i>, as
the <i>Spaniards</i> call it, of it self.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Original.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>The Natives of the Countrey are of the Race of the <i>Chichimecæ</i>, a Salvage and
Wilde sort of People, of the Province of <i>New-Gallicia</i>, especially in the Parts of
<i>New-Biscay</i>, living in Forests and in deep Caves under Ground; whose Posterity do
still at this day much trouble and annoy the Countrey thereabouts; notwithstanding
all the endeavors of the <i>Spaniards</i>, and the Garrisons which they keep in those
parts on purpose to destroy them. About five hundred years ago, or more, according
to the account of the <i>Mexican Annals</i>, divers Hoards, as they are call’d, of these <i>Chichimecæ</i>,
weary, it seems, of their Woods and subterraneous dwellings, issu’d out into
the more open Air, and fell down in huge multitudes into these Southerly parts
of <i>America</i>, which are now call’d <i>Mexico</i> and <i>New-Spain</i>; not all at once, but at several
times, and under several names, <i>viz.</i> of the <i>Suchimilci</i>, <i>Chalcæ</i>, <i>Tepanecæ</i>, <i>Tlascaltecæ</i>,
and others, who subduing or driving out the People they found in those parts,
Seated themselves in their room: And though at first every Nation or Company
of them, as they came, seiz’d upon some Province apart by themselves, and held
it, as it were, in Soveraignty to themselves, without acknowledgement of any dependance
or subjection to their Neighbors, or those that were there before them;
yet in Tract of time, and by fortune of the Wars, which they made one upon another,
they fell under the Government of one King, <i>viz.</i> the King of <i>Mexico</i>,
which was the chief City of the Province.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The state of the <i>Mexican</i> Kingdom before the <i>Spaniards</i> arrival.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Kingdom, at the time that the <i>Spaniards</i> first Discover’d the Countrey, was
Govern’d by a Prince, nam’d <i>Motezuma</i>; one, who by his Valor and good success in
the Wars, had in a few years of his Reign, before the <i>Spaniards</i> came thither, subdu’d
the better part of a hundred Cities and great Towns to his Dominion; and
held in actual submission to his Government, and Tributary to him, no less than
thirty several <i>Casiques</i> or petty Princes; every one of which paid him Tribute, and
were able upon occasion to bring into the Field an hundred thousand Men: He is
said to have been, for his Person, a wise and good Prince, just, affable, and tender
of his Subjects good: but by reason of some heavy exactions, which his own power,
and the Practise of his Ancestors before him, gave him the confidence to Impose
upon the Conquer’d People, a great part of his Subjects liv’d but unwillingly under
his Obedience, and rather by constraint than otherwise: being also further exasperated
against him by one barbarous Custom, which the <i>Mexicans</i> frequently
us’d, <i>viz.</i> the Sacrificing of Men. Their manner was, whensoever they had any
solemn occasion of doing Honor to their Devil-god <i>Vitzilopuchtli</i>, as they call him,
to send out an Army of Men from <i>Mexico</i>, into some of the subdu’d Provinces, (in
case they had no Enemies nearer Hand) and to fetch in as many Men as they
thought good, to be Sacrific’d; whose flesh likewise afterwards they did eat in a
solemn Banquet. This being a business of their Satanical Religion, and <i>Motezuma</i>
a Prince extremely Superstitious and Devoted to the Service of his gods, it is said,
that he Sacrific’d commonly, one year with another, twenty thousand Men, and
some years, upon extraordinary occasions, not less than fifty thousand: So great
and grievous a Tyranny, by the just Judgement and Permission of Almighty God,
for their great and unnatural sins, did the Enemy of Mankind exercise upon them.
He was likewise much given to Women, but it was onely to such as were counted
his Wives; of which he is said to have had no less than a hundred and fifty with
Child by him at one time.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The bounds of the <i>Mexican</i> Kingdom.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Riches of <i>Mexico</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Bounds of this Kingdom at present are thus; on the East it hath a large
Arm of the Sea, which they call <i>The Bay of New-Spain</i>, or <i>The Gulf of Mexico</i>; On
the West, it hath some parts of <i>New-Gallicia</i>, and <i>Mare del Zur</i>; on the North, the
rest of <i>New-Gallicia</i>, and part of <i>Florida</i>; and on the South, <i>Mare del Zur</i> again, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>part of <i>Guatimala</i>. It extendeth it self in length from <i>Jucatan</i> South-East, to the Borders
of <i>New Gallicia</i> Northward, above eight hundred <i>Italian</i> Miles, and in breadth,
from <i>Panuco</i> to the South Sea, about half so much. It lieth wholly under the <i>Torrid
Zone</i>: nor is it a Countrey generally so mountainous or high seated, as some
others of <i>America</i> are but for the most part level or low; yet is it so fann’d, (for
three parts at least of four, by the cooling Blasts of the Sea, and the Heats otherwise
so moderated with frequent Rains, which it hath constantly three Moneths in
the Year, <i>viz.</i> <i>June</i>, <i>July</i>, and <i>August</i>) that the Air is rendred thereby exceeding temperate,
and the Climate not unhealthful, especially to temperate Bodies, and such as
are never so little us’d to it. A goodly Countrey it is, of inexhaustible Wealth and
Riches, whether we regard the Mynes of Gold, Silver, Brass, Iron, <i>&amp;c.</i> of all
which it hath many, and very good; or the Fruits of the Earth, abundance of
Cattel, plenty of Corn and Grain, of which they have two Harvests; or any other
Commodities and Endowments of Nature, which serve for the enriching of the
World. Amongst other things, it affords <i>Cassia</i>, the Fruit whereof is a thing well
known, and much commended by the Apothecaries for its use in Physick, especially
in Purgations, and removing of all Obstructions of Phlegm, Choler, <i>&amp;c.</i> Such
store of Balm, Amber, all sorts of Gums and precious Liquors, as no Countrey in
the World is better furnish’d with excellent Perfumes and Physick, than the Kingdom
of <i>New Spain</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Tunas</i>-Tree.</div>

<p class='c010'>Among the many other sorts of Trees which this Countrey produces, the most
remarkable is their <i>Tunas</i>, of which, there being five kinds, one is call’d <i>Cumbeba</i>,
from whence proceeds that admirable Tincture, commonly known by the Name
of <i>Cochinele</i>, which is thus made: On the top of this Tree is found a Worm, which
hath the bigness and shape of a great Louse, which so increases, that in one years
time a hundred Trees shall be stock’d from the seed of one of these Animals. The
Worm it self being white, after the Skin is carefully pull’d off, put in cold Water
or Ashes, and so dry’d, becomes <i>Cochinele</i>. The best sort of it is to be had in <i>Tlascala</i>,
and that in so great a quantity, that no less than five or six hundred <i>Arrobes</i> of <i>Spanish</i>
Measure (each <i>Arrobe</i> is as much as five <i>English</i> Bushels) is yearly Transported
thence. The other sort, which grows on the Mountains, and that which is not so
carefully gather’d, call’d <i>Chichimecas</i>, Dyes not so well as the right <i>Cochinele</i>. The
<i>Tunas</i> also bears a Fruit long and whitish, with a smooth Shell, and full of little
Seeds like Figs: The red, which are inferior in taste to the white, colours the
Urine red.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Pine-Apples.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Pine-Apples which grow here differ from the <i>Spanish</i>, for the Pulp is not
inclos’d in a Shell: They have a pleasant smell, and a Pulp, which if eaten much
of, causes an Appetite, it being of a tartish taste; they keep good a long time when
Salted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fruit <i>Cacao</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>But much more beneficial is the <i>Cacao</i>, with which Fruit <i>New Spain</i> drives a great
Trade; nay, serves for Coin’d Money. When they deliver a Parcel of <i>Cacao</i>, they
tell them by five, thirty, and a hundred. Their Charity to the Poor never exceeds
above one <i>Cacao</i>-Nut. The chief reason for which this Fruit is so highly esteem’d,
is for the <i>Chocolate</i>, which is made of the same, without which the Inhabitants (being
so us’d to it) are not able to live, notwithstanding it causes Phlegm and Vomiting
to those that are strangers thereto. When the <i>English</i> Commander <i>Thomas
Candish</i> coming into the Haven <i>Guatulco</i>, burnt two hundred thousand Tun of <i>Cacao</i>,
it prov’d no small loss to all <i>New Spain</i>, the Provinces <i>Guatimala</i> and <i>Nicaragua</i> not
producing so much in a whole year. The Trees on which this Fruit grows are divided
into four sorts, differing in bigness and shape: all of them are very tender,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>for they will not onely grow in no place but on their usual Ground, but cannot endure
the cold Nights Storms, or excesses of Heat; wherefore the <i>Cacao</i>-Trees which
grow out of the Fruit that falls off, come to no perfection, except in shady and
warm Valleys; which is also the reason why the Planters of <i>New Spain</i> plant the
great Leafy Tree <i>Cacaoquanthly</i> (that is, <i>The Mother of the Cacao</i>’s) near the <i>Cacao</i>-Tree,
that it may the better grow under the Shadow thereof; in which manner whole
Woods are planted: In the second year it bears Fruit, which is first ripe in <i>January</i>,
and again in the midst of Summer. Amongst the four sorts the chiefest is <i>Quathuitl</i>,
of an indifferent heighth, and full of sharp-pointed Leaves, which are fast to the
Boughs without Stalks, and bears a great Flower of a yellowish colour, which falling
off, leaves long, tough, and hairy Threds behind them, out of which grows the
<i>Cacavently</i>, a Fruit which is oval, heavy like a Melon, of a Saffron-colour, of a fat
and thick Juice, a bitterish, yet pleasant taste, and very cooling; being dry’d in
the Sun it is thereby made fit to keep; it is likewise highly esteem’d, because the <i>Chocolate</i>
is made of the same. Before the <i>Spaniards</i> made themselves Masters of <i>Mexico</i>,
no other Drink was esteem’d but that of the <i>Cacao</i>; none caring for Wine, notwithstanding
the Soil produces Vines every where in great abundance of it self.
But besides the <i>Quathuil</i>, <i>New Spain</i> hath three other sorts of <i>Cacao</i>-Trees, <i>viz.</i> <i>Mecanal</i>,
pleasant to behold for its heighth, large Leaves and Fruit; the next is the <i>Xochucaual</i>,
which is less than the former; and lastly the least sort, which is call’d
<i>Halcacahual</i>. The Fruit of these four sorts of Trees, though differing in shape, yet
is all one in power and operation.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_275.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spaniards</i> to make <i>Chocolate</i> mix <i>Maiz</i> (by the <i>Mexicans</i> call’d <i>Tlaolli</i>) either
whole or Ground, or boyl’d before with Chalk. Moreover, they put the red Kernels
also in the Drink, which grow in the Fruit of the <i>Achiote</i>-Tree. Of the Kernels,
which are dry and cooling, boyl’d in Water, and stirr’d till it comes to a Pap, they
make Cakes, which mix’d with the <i>Chocolate</i>, gives it a cleansing power, and takes
away all tastes that cause vomiting.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Pepper <i>Mecaxochite</i>, which grows creeping along the Earth, with long and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>fragrant Leaves, round Stalks, hairy Roots, and three long Cods which shoot upwards.
This Pepper tempers the over-cooling property of the <i>Chocolate</i>. Lastly,
it consists also of <i>Xochinacatlis</i>, <i>Tlilxochitle</i>, and the Rozenish Gum, <i>Holli</i>. The <i>Xocinacatli</i>
is a Tree with small Leaves, and great Flowers hanging on long Stalks that
bend downwards, within of a purple, and without of a dark-green colour, of a
sweet smell, and resembling an Ear; and this Flower also gives a pleasant taste and
wholsom operation to the <i>Chocolate</i>. The <i>Tlilxochitle</i> runs up to the tops of Trees
like Ivy; the Flowers, of a darkish brown colour, cleanse the Nerves, strengthen
the Brain, and take away the rawness of the Stomach. The <i>Holli</i> drops out of the
<i>Holquabuytle</i>, a smooth barky Tree full of Moisture, which at first appearance is
white, then yellowish, and lastly black, which kneaded into round Balls and
Roasted, is a remedy against a Loosness and soreness of the Bowels.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nature of the People.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Natives of the Countrey are very ingenious in divers mechanical Arts,
especially in making of Feather-Pictures, a piece of Curiosity wherein they are held
to be incomparably, or rather inimitably excellent; and so industrious at it, that although
the <i>Americans</i> generally are not a People over-much addicted to any kind of
Labor or Study, yet at this they will sit a whole day together, without either
Meat or Drink, onely out of a natural affection they have to the Work, and a desire
to be excellent in it; The Countrey indeed affords them great variety of Birds
and other Fowl, of most rare and exquisite Colours, which is a great advantage to
their Skill, and helps much to the accomplishment of their Work. They Paint
likewise very curiously upon their Cottons; and are held to be generally the best
Goldsmiths in the World; of most perfect skill in the purging and refining of all
sorts of Metals, but especially of Gold and Silver: And yet in other things so
strangely stupid and ignorant, that when the <i>Spaniards</i> first appeared amongst them,
not a few of them (as ’tis reported) took the Horse and Man both for one Creature;
and when the Horse Neighed, they would enquire very seriously what he
said.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Lakes of <i>New-Spain</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>There are likewise many fair Lakes in this Province, but the principal are those
of <i>Chapala</i> and <i>Mexico</i>: the former of which is in the more Northern parts of the
Kingdom, towards the Borders of <i>New Gallicia</i>, and is chiefly famous for the abundance
of good Salt that is yearly made and Transported thence. The other of
<i>Mexico</i> is one of the largest and goodliest in the World, of circular form (as
some say) little less than nine hundred Miles in compass, environ’d with the main
Land, the <i>Peninsula</i>, or Cape of <i>Florida</i>, <i>Jucatan</i>, and the Island <i>Cuba</i>, having two
onely Passages in and out, and both of them well fortifi’d: the one betwixt the
Point of <i>Jucatan</i> and the Isle <i>Cuba</i>, where the Tyde violently enters; and the other
betwixt the said Island and the Cape of <i>Florida</i>, where it goeth as violently out: upon
which Gulf the King of <i>Spain</i> hath always some good Ships in readiness for all
occasions; and by them, ’tis suppos’d, he doth more assure his Estates in those parts
of <i>America</i>, than by all the Garrisons besides.</p>

<p class='c010'>The whole Kingdom of <i>Mexico</i>, or <i>New Spain</i>, is subdivided into these Inferior
Provinces:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The several Provinces.</div>

<p class='c010'>1. The Arch-bishoprick of <i>Mexico</i>. 2. The Bishoprick, <i>Mechoacon</i>. 3. <i>Los
Angelos</i>, or <i>Tlascale</i>. 4. <i>Guaxaca.</i> 5. The Lordship <i>Panuco</i>: And 6. the Province
<i>Tabasco</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Mexico</i>, the chief Province of <i>New-Spain</i>, so denominated from <i>Mexico</i> the chief
City, not only of the Province, but of all <i>America</i>; lying between <i>Tlascale</i> and <i>Mechoacan</i>,
extends in length from North to South, a hundred and seventeen Leagues;
and in breadth along the Southern Ocean, seventeen, but up in the Countrey, fifty
four Leagues: In which circumference lie to the North-East, <i>Lateotlalpa</i>, <i>Mextitlan</i>,
<i>Xilotepeque</i>, and <i>Panuco</i>; Westward, <i>Matalzingo</i>, and <i>Cultepeque</i>; Eastward, <i>Tuzcoco</i>;
South-East, <i>Chalco</i>; Southward, <i>Suchimilco</i>, <i>Tlaluc</i>, <i>Coyxca</i>, and <i>Acapulco</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Bounds of <i>Mexicana</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>It is bounded on the East, with the Gulf of <i>Mexico</i>; on the West, with <i>Mechoacan</i>;
on the North, with <i>Panuco</i>, and some parts of <i>New-Gallicia</i>; and on the South,
with <i>Tlascalla</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nature of the Countrey.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey is both large and rich, containing not much less than one hundred
and thirty Leagues, both in length and breadth; and if it yields any thing to
<i>Peru</i> in the plenty of Gold and Silver, ’tis certain it much excels it in many other
Commodities; as namely, in all sorts of Fruits, abundance of Cattel, plenty of
Corn and Grain; in all which, the advantage this Countrey hath, not only of <i>Peru</i>,
but of all the other Provinces of <i>America</i> beside, is well known: Not to speak
any thing of the great plenty and variety of good Fish, which both the Rivers and
Lakes of this Countrey afford, which is very great; insomuch, that the very Tribute
of the one Lake of <i>Mexico</i> is said to yield an Income of above twenty thousand
Crowns yearly, one with another.</p>

<p class='c010'>The People of the Countrey are generally Industrious and Active, especially
since the <i>Spaniards</i> came among them; rich Merchants, if they apply themselves to
it; and they say likewise good Soldiers, when they are train’d and imploy’d that
way.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chief Towns of <i>Mexicana</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chief Towns and places of the Province are, 1. <i>Mexico</i>, both anciently and
at present, the Metropolis and Capital City; being the Seat of an Archbishop, and
the ordinary Residence of the Vice-Roy, and chief Governors of <i>New-Spain</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the City <i>Mexico</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>This City, by the <i>Indians</i> was formerly call’d <i>Tenustatan</i>, lies in nineteen Degrees
and a half to the Northward of the <i>Equinoctial-Line</i>, rais’d out of a brackish Lake,
full of muddy Water; whose circumference along the Mountains is seventy
Leagues: This Lake swarms continually with Boats, which carry the People to
and again from one inhabited Island to another; four Stone-bridges, no less costly
than artificial, with Arches and Gates in several places, lead from the City to
the Main Continent.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fresh Water which they have in the City <i>Mexico</i>, is led into the same through
Pipes that lie in the bottom of the Lake; but none are to enjoy the benefit thereof,
before they have paid a certain Sum of Money to the King’s Collectors.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, the City divided into Islands, contains above sixty thousand Houses,
which being built on several Isles, have large Bridges, which reach from one to another;
some that lie in the middle of the Lake, they approach in little Boats; round
about the Lake, especially where the way leads from the Continent into the City,
lie several Suburbs, all inclos’d with Walls; between which stand strong Towers,
cover’d on the top: To keep off the force of the Water, the <i>Tenustatans</i> have with
great labor and charge, made a Bank through the Lake, half way along the City: But
the Lake <i>Laguna</i>, from whose bottom <i>Mexico</i> is rais’d, is divided in two parts, the
<i>Sweet Lake</i>, which is higher than the <i>Salt</i>, falls in to the same through Sluces, with
Bridges built on the Bank that leads from the City to the main Land: The <i>Salt-Lake</i>,
which hath brackish and bitter Water, ebbs and flows according as the Wind
blows; no Fish is able to live in the same, because the Water which in the sight
of <i>Mexico</i> falls into the same out of the Mountains, hath a sulphury Ground: All
along the shore, much Salt is made, with which the Citizens drive a great Trade:
There are continually above a hundred thousand Boats (by the <i>Indians</i> call’d <i>Acales</i>,
and by the <i>Spaniards</i>, <i>Canoos</i>) going off and on from one shore to another: The fresh
Water Lake, which is bigger than the salt, and feeds small Fishes, hath above fifty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Suburbs about the same, of which, some boast five thousand, and others ten
thousand Houses: Nay, the Suburb <i>Tescuco</i>, in former times was no way inferior
to <i>Mexico</i> in bigness; since the <i>Spaniards</i> have been Masters of this City, they stopt
up many Moats, to inlarge their narrow Streets.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides three publick Markets, every open place affords all sorts of Provisions
daily; the <i>Indians</i> call the Markets <i>Tianguystly</i>, and the <i>Spaniards</i>, <i>Tianguez</i>; the first
and chiefest stands in <i>Tatelulco</i>, adorn’d with Galleries on three sides; in the middle
of this Square, which is accounted the biggest in the World, stands next to the
place of Execution, a stately Fountain; the Tents which are every Week pitch’d
up here for Trade, amount to above thirty thousand. The second Market call’d
St. <i>John</i>’s, is in <i>Mexico</i>, and swarms continually with People. The third is call’d
<i>Hipolito</i>, from the <i>Guardian-Saint</i> of the City, whither every Wednesday and Thursday
comes such a multitude of People, that this spacious Market is too little for
them; for the sale of every Commodity, a peculiar corner is allotted; but great
Packs are left to be dispos’d of in Boats, which lie near the shore.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the four corners of the City, at present call’d <i>St. John</i>, <i>St. Maria la Rotonda</i>,
<i>St. Pablo</i>, and <i>St. Sebastian</i>, are above four thousand <i>Spanish</i> Families, and thirty
thousand <i>Indians</i>, besides what inhabit <i>Tatelulco</i>, now <i>St. Jago</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Temperature of the Air.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Air in this place is very strange; in the day time, the Sky is generally Serene;
the North Wind against the Evening brings Rain, of which the Mountain
<i>Tepeaquilla</i> lying a little League beyond the City, gives certain Testimonies; for
when a black Cloud appears on the top thereof, it is certain to be blown from
thence over <i>Mexico</i> with Rain: After a moist Evening follows a Star-light Night,
and a pleasant Morning: From <i>September</i> till <i>May</i>, it is generally dry Weather here,
but if it chances to Rain, the Rain is attended with a Storm, which occasions
a sulphurous Fogg, very unwholsom, and so dark, that one Man cannot discern
another, and causes a pain through all the Limbs, nay sometimes Death it
self; wherefore, whensoe’re it approaches, every one keeps close in his House, or
goes into the Countrey.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, it is worthy of observation, how strangely this City is alter’d since
its being Conquer’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>, and especially when <i>Anno 1629.</i> it was overflow’d
by a mighty Deluge; which alteration by <i>Barnabe Cabo</i>, in a Letter to the
<i>Jesuite Hernande Leon</i>, is thus set forth:</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Barnabe Cabo</i>, his Description of Mexico.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Mexico</i> overflow’d.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Mexico</i>, says he, lying in a Valley between high Mountains, hath seventy
Leagues in circumference: The Valley being Oval, is for the most part interspers’d
with Lakes, which the <i>Indians</i>, and after them the <i>Spaniards</i> have digg’d, only
the Lake which washes <i>Mexico</i> is natural; and to stop the Water-falls, there are
Banks and Sluces every where: The Flood before <i>Mexicalcingo</i> flows a Fathom and
a half higher than before <i>Mexico</i>. The four other Lakes to the Northward have
much more Water than the <i>Mexicalcingo</i>, of which, some have scarce four, others
but three Leagues in circumference; when as <i>Mexicalcingo</i>’s Lake reckons fifteen,
and <i>Mexico</i>’s sixteen. On the breaking of the Banks, <i>Mexico</i> hath often suffer’d great
damage, wherefore the Vice-Roy <i>de Valesco</i> took special care to make a vent for
the Water through the lowest Mountains; whereupon the Countrey being Survey’d,
the Northern Coast near the Village <i>Gueguenoca</i>, was found to be the most
convenient. But about the manner of letting the Water out, the Surveyors could
no ways agree; most of them were of opinion to dig Channels, into which the
Lakes might discharge their Waters; others, thought best to make a Gutter under
Ground, which last <i>Valesco</i> put in hand with unhappy success, because the Laborers
who under-min’d the Ground, were choak’d with the falling in of the Sand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>or stifled with the sulphurous Vapors rising out of the Earth: Nevertheless, they
gave not over the Work, though they began it quite another way, for a <i>French</i>-Man,
call’d <i>Henry Martin</i>, advis’d to deepen the River <i>Quaiotitlan</i>, which falls into the
<i>Laguna</i>, and by that means make it a Bay, into which the <i>Laguna</i> might pour her
over-charg’d Waters: Which design, though contradicted by the Jesuit <i>John Sanchez</i>,
was put in practice; by which means the Water fell in a short time so much, that
they could walk dry to the Cliff <i>El Ponnel</i>, lying a League from the City; wherefore
they continually labour’d on this Work, till such time <i>Conde de Getues</i> came
over for Vice-Roy, who judg’d the Charge to be unnecessary, nay Commanded
the Ditches to be broken down, which stopt the Water along the Silver Mines of
<i>Pachuca</i>, that he might see exactly how much it would over-flow <i>Mexico</i>: After
which the Flood rose yearly higher and higher; till at last, <i>Anno 1629.</i> a mighty
Rain falling, swole the <i>Laguna</i> in such a manner, that it over-whelm’d all <i>Mexico</i>,
wash’d down the Houses, all Merchandizes which could not endure the Water,
were spoil’d, and had not they had innumerable Boats to help them, thousands of
People might have perish’d in this Deluge: But at last, <i>Henry Martin</i> restor’d
again the fore-mention’d Channel to its former Perfection, and brought the Flood
which fell down out of the Mountains within the Banks of the River.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Stately Palaces.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Quantitlan</i> digg’d also a Channel of eight thousand Fathom long, and made an
Arch’d Sewer under Ground of the same length, which Sewer hath at every two
hundred Fathoms distance, Vent-holes, and a hole of sixty Fathom deep, and by this
means, diverting abundance of Water, they dry’d <i>Mexico</i> in a short time: When the
Banks and Streets began no sooner to appear, but they fell to work to raise the
Ground, and to lay Bridges, and also to build more Boats. The Citizens likewise
found it convenient to make another deep Sewer for the carrying away of
more Water, notwithstanding it requir’d twenty years labor. The River, which in
a manner runs through the middle of the City, is curb’d by a Wall; a crooked
Bridge, with many Arches, and of a long extent, leads to the City, in which stand
many brave Palaces, with pleasant Walks of Trees about them; the Cloysters of
several Orders of Fryers, appear with high Spires and Turrets, above all other
Buildings.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>And Monasteries.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Franciscans</i> have here four very sumptuous Buildings: The first, Consecrated
to St. <i>Francis</i>, stands in the uppermost part of <i>Mexico</i>, within a large square Court,
and on each a pleasant Walk of Trees: The Cloyster it self is very high, and trebble
Wall’d, with Towers and Galleries about it: In the middle of the City
stands another Tower’d-Cloyster, call’d St. <i>Jago</i>. The third lies a little distance
from it, which being built long, hath a stately Turret, and is call’d <i>Maria de Rodonda</i>.
The fourth, not far from the first, but much smaller, is nam’d <i>San Diego</i>; these
belong to the <i>Franciscans</i>. The <i>Augustin</i> Monks are also no way inferior to the <i>Franciscans</i>,
for magnificent Structures, with spacious Halls, high Towers, and rich
Balconies: The first is denominated from St. <i>Augustine</i>, just behind which appears
<i>San Pabla</i>, less stately than the rest. St. <i>Sebastian</i>, near the <i>Laguna</i>, is built in manner
like a Church, whose Tower ends like a Pyramid. The Cloyster <i>San Cruz</i>, belonging
also to the <i>Augustines</i>, built square, stands near the Market, in the middle of
which stands a stately Fountain: The Court within inviron’d with thick Walls,
amazes the beholders by the pleasantness of its situation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, the <i>Dominicans</i> inhabit two brave Cloysters; the chiefest Dedicated to
St. <i>Dominic</i>, is eight square; to which is adjoyning a pretty large Church, with a
Steeple: The second, which stands on one side of <i>St. Jago</i>, and consists of three several
Structures, is call’d <i>Collegio de Porta Cœli</i>. Opposite to <i>St. Jago</i>, near the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>Market the <i>Jesuits</i> have a stately Colledge, or High-School, where many are
brought up in the Latin and Greek Tongues, whence it is call’d, <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Casa Professa Les
Estudios</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is also another Habitation of Religious Men, call’d <i>Illefonse Sanna Noviciad</i>,
which for State, may vie with any Royal Palace.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cloysters belonging to the <i>Monks</i> of <i>La Merced</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Monks</i> of <i>La Merced</i> dwell in two Cloysters, both Consecrated to the Virgin
<i>Mary</i>, yet Sirnam’d <i>Montseratte</i>, and <i>Carmel</i>: The first lying not far from the
River, is a mean Structure, in comparison to the last; the uppermost Tower of
whose Temple appears above all other Buildings, in the upper part of <i>Mexico</i> near
the Cloyster of St. <i>Francis</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Womens Cloysters.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Women have also fourteen Cloysters here, the chiefest whereof is Dedicated
to <i>Catharine</i> of <i>Siena</i>; but much more splendid is that of <i>Santa Teresa</i>, built like
an Imperial Palace; famous for its stately Gardens, and round Fountain, which
continually spouts Water. The rest, which we shall onely name, are <i>La Encarnacio</i>,
<i>Santa Ines</i>, <i>Jesus-Maria</i>, <i>Laurenso</i>, <i>Las Des-calcas</i>, <i>Santa Clara</i>, <i>Juan de la Penitentia</i>,
<i>Regina Cœli</i>, <i>Santa Monica</i>, <i>las Rocogidas</i>, <i>Jeronymo</i>, and <i>Conceptione</i>; besides the
Almshouses, <i>Real de los Indios</i>, and <i>Nostra Senora del Amor</i>: There are likewise eight
Hospitals, <i>viz.</i> <i>de Dios</i>, <i>del Spiritu Santo</i>, <i>Juan de Doys</i>, <i>de la Misericordia</i>, <i>de san Hippolito</i>,
and <i>de san Lazaro</i>. The three chief Churches bear the Name of <i>Catharine</i>, <i>Martin</i>,
and <i>Vera Cruz</i>; and the Clergy-men thereto belonging, enjoy many stately Palaces,
amongst which are <i>Juan de Lateran</i>, <i>de Christo</i>, and <i>las Nivas</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Vice-Roy’s Palace and Arch-bishop’s Seat.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Residence of the Vice-Roy which lies near the <i>Dominican</i> Cloyster, <i>Porto Cœli</i>,
is so sumptuous a Structure, that it may stand in competition with any of those
Edifices which were so much cry’d up by the Ancients; nevertheless, it is not to be
compar’d to the Arch-bishop’s Seat, built round like a Theatre, whose Luster expresses
the Quality of him that inhabits the same, he being Governor of the Bishopricks
of <i>Fascala</i>, <i>Guaxaca</i>, <i>Mechaocan</i>, <i>New Galicia</i>, <i>Chiapa</i>, <i>Yucatan</i>, <i>Guatimala</i>, <i>Verapaz</i>,
and the <i>Philippinas</i>. This marvellous Structure was begun by <i>Ferdinand Cortesius</i>,
but was finish’d by <i>Sebastian Ramires de Fuenleal</i>; and not much inferior thereunto
is the <i>Casa de Cabildo Alameda</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The gallantry of <i>Mexico</i> at this day.</div>

<p class='c010'>At present, <i>Mexico</i> is thought to be one of the richest Cities of the World,
abounding (if reports be true) in all kind of voluptuous gallantry and bravery,
even to excess: It is suppos’d to contain about six or seven Miles in compass, and
to consist of above an hundred thousand Houses or Families, whereof not the tenth
part <i>Spaniards</i>, but those that are, all Gentlemen, at least as to their garb and
manner of living; for they live most splendidly in all respects, both for Diet and
Apparel.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the first, we have spoken so much already of the general plenty of all things
in the Kingdom of <i>New-Spain</i>, that pertain to this part of pleasure, that it is not
to be doubted: And for the second this may be some instance, <i>viz.</i> that it is no extraordinary
matter to see an Hat-band or Role all of Diamonds, in some ordinary
Gentlemans Hat; and of Pearl among the common Citizens and Tradesmen.
The Coaches (which most Gentlemen keep) almost cover’d with Gold and Silver,
richly beset with Precious Stones, and within ordinarily lin’d with Cloth of Gold,
or the best <i>China</i> Silk that can be gotten; of which Coaches, in time of year, at the
<i>Alameda</i>, as they call it, which is, as it were, <i>The Hide-Park of Mexico</i>, and a place
made of purpose for recreation and delight, a Man shall observe not seldom, above
a thousand or two thousand Coaches, full of Ladies and Gallants coming thither
onely to take the Air, and their Pleasure, both the one and the other attended with
a numerous Train of Servants and <i>Mulattoes</i> of both Sexes. In <i>la Plateria</i>, which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>but onely one Street in <i>Mexico</i>, nigh to the Vice-Roy’s Palace, in less than half an
hours space: with the turn of an Eye, you may see Millions of Wealth in Gold,
Silver, and Precious Stones, in the Goldsmiths and Jewellers Shops thereabouts.
In a word, there is nothing hinders <i>Mexico</i> from being the most absolute City in
the World for delight and bravery, but onely two Inconveniences to which it is
subject: The one is the danger of the Lake, with the Infalls whereof it may seem
to be almost continually threatned, and in the Year 1629. did actually suffer a very
great calamity, the Waters breaking through the Banks, and drowning a great
part of the City, with the destruction of much People, and the loss of all their
Goods intirely, through the avarice (as is suppos’d) of the Vice-Roy that then was,
and some other of the King’s Officers, who diverted the Money that should have
been employ’d for the fortifying and repairing of the Banks, to their own proper
uses: The other is from the nature of the Soil and Ground it self on which it
standeth; which is found to have a tincture of <i>Sal</i> Nitre in it, somewhat strong;
and the Winds partly from the Lake it self, and partly from the Hills about it, raising
the Dust of this Earth constantly every Evening, for many Moneths of the
Year together, so violently, that the Air is even darkned therewith for some time:
The Inhabitants are much annoy’d by it, and made subject to divers Hypocondriacal
Pains and Infirmities, and sometimes kill’d with it, especially such as either
cannot, or care not much to avoid it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The City lieth about sixty Leagues, or a hundred and fifty Miles distant from
the <i>Atlantick</i> or North Sea, from whence by the Port of <i>St. John d’Ullua</i>, or <i>Vera
Crux</i>, (which are the usual Landing-places) there is a fair and easie March to <i>Mexico</i>,
by the Cities of <i>Xalabar</i>, <i>Perotta</i>, <i>Puebla de los Angelos</i>, and <i>Tlascalla</i>, all of them open
and unfortifi’d Places, (as likewise <i>Mexico</i> it self) and the Countrey round about
very rich and well accommodated with all things.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>City <i>Chulula</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The next City of note in ancient times was <i>Chulula</i>, which being built in a fruitful
Plain, had above twenty thousand Dwelling-houses, and as many more Banquetting-houses.
The number of the Temples and Turrets were equal with that
of the days in the Year: The Government thereof belong’d to a Mayor and six
Aldermen, and one chief Priest; for they never went upon the least Design before
they had been at their Devotion; in which the Priest’s Office was onely to
perfume the Idols four times in twenty four hours, <i>viz.</i> in the Morning, at Noon,
after Sun-set, and at Midnight; at which times none durst be absent, but they us’d
also a cruel Exercise on themselves, and one much more cruel on others, for on
usual Feast-days they abstain’d from Meat, Drink, and Sleep, scourg’d their Bodies
with knotted Cords after a miserable manner, evacuated their Seed, that so they
might curb all fleshly Desires, and met every Night in a spacious place, where sitting
down they wounded themselves with Lances in their Legs and Arms, so long
till the Blood gush’d out of the same; which gathering in a Cup, they anointed
their Temples therewith, and dipt the Lances in the same, and then hung them up
before the Temple in Bundles of Straw. Of these were a great number, and the
more, because they never us’d their Lances but once. But on these Days, which
were Consecrated to the Idol <i>Tezcatlipuca</i>, every one besides the Priests wore a new
Rope made of the Hemp <i>Mangey</i>, of a Fathom long, and a thick Knot at the end,
with which they beat themselves so miserably on their Backs, as if they intended to
have broken them: After which the Priests stay’d five days in the Temple, in
which they us’d the like cruelty, eating scarce once in twenty four hours.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Prisoners they us’d after a most horrid manner, <i>viz.</i> in their Temples
stood a round Stage of Stone; to the top of which they ascended by a Square Scaffold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>supported by twenty eight Pillars; behind which appear’d thousands of Mens
Heads, and amongst them the Prisoners that were to be Offer’d sat stark naked,
and guarded by several Armed Men; three Foot from the Steps which led up to
the top of the Scaffold, stood a pyramidical Stone, (by the <i>Indians</i> call’d <i>Quauxicalli</i>)
and behind it two round Chappels, cover’d on the top like Mitres, each had
four Holes in a large Gate, in which sat a horrid Representation, worshipp’d by
six Priests call’d <i>Chackalmua</i>, whereof one call’d <i>Papas</i>, or <i>Topilzin</i>, whose Office was
to pluck out the Hearts of the Prisoners, being in greatest esteem, wore a red Mantle
about his Body, not unlike a long Coat, with broad Fringe, which trail’d after
him upon the Ground, and also a Crown of green and yellow Plumes on his
Head; his Ears and under Lip were likewise adorn’d with Precious Stones: The
other five appear’d in like manner with their Hands and Faces painted red, but having
Leathern <i>Fascia</i>’s about their Heads, and white Coats stitch’d with Black on
their Bodies, they might easily be distinguish’d from the <i>Topilzin</i>; who on a sudden
ran down the Stairs to the Prisoners, and shew’d each of them an Image, (saying,
<i>This is your God</i>) made of <i>Bledo</i> Paste, <i>Maiz</i> and Honey, green Beads for Eyes, and
Grains of <i>Maiz</i> for Teeth: whereupon the Prisoners were led up, and laid with
their Backs on the sharp Stone <i>Quauxicalli</i>; then the five Priests took hold of their
Leggs, Arms and Head, put woodden Collars about the Sufferer’s Necks, whilst
the <i>Topilzin</i> shew’d Reverence to the Idol; which done, with a sharp Stone he cut
open the Breasts of the Prisoners, who in a deplorable condition lay on the pyramidical
Stone, and pulling their Hearts out of their Bodies, shew’d the same reeking
to the Sun, and at last threw them toward the Idol, and the dead Bodies down
the Stairs, where some appointed for that purpose carried the same away; but every
one taking his own Prisoner, and roasting and boyling him, serv’d him up to his
Friends as a great Dainty.</p>

<p class='c010'>This kind of Murdering was not onely us’d amongst the <i>Mexicans</i>, but also by all
the other neighboring <i>Indians</i>, and especially in the City <i>Chulula</i>, which (as we have
said before) signifies <i>The Sanctity of all the Gods</i>: for in this Town six thousand
Children were yearly Offer’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Citizens hereof us’d to drive a great Trade, especially in <i>Cochinele</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Habits were several; for Persons of Note wore Cotton Coats, about the
Edges of which hung Feathers and pieces of Cony-skins: the meaner sort went in
<i>Nequons</i>, or a sort of Linnen Coats made of the hairy Leaves of the Tree <i>Maguey</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. The City <i>Tezuco</i>, full of handsom Streets and fair Houses, is built near the
salt <i>Mexican</i> Lake, yet hath no want of fresh Water, with which it is supply’d by
Gutters from the Mountains under Ground, according to <i>Anthony Herrera</i>, it twice
exceedeth in bigness the famous City <i>Sivill</i> in <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>Quitlavaca</i>, by the <i>Spaniards</i> call’d <i>Venezuela</i>, (because it is, like <i>Venice</i>, surrounded
with Water, and divided into several Isles,) boasted formerly above two
thousand Families: From the Town a Cawsey of twenty Foot broad, and half a
League long, leads through the Lake to the Main Continent.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <i>Yztacpalapa</i>, a very populous Place, and lying part of it in the salt Lake, and
partly on the Main Land; where several fresh-water Pools afford store of Fish,
two Leagues distant from <i>Mexico</i>, to which leads a broad Way; in the middle of
which stands a Fountain, surrounded with high Trees, which produces excellent
Water.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <i>Mexicaltzingo</i>, situate upon the Lake <i>Laguna</i>, a Town consisting of four thousand
stately Houses.</p>

<p class='c010'>7. <i>Cayocan</i>, in a fruitful Plain, containing six thousand, being but a League and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>a half from <i>Yztacpalapa</i>: to which the neighboring Village <i>Houcilopucho</i> was not
much inferior.</p>

<p class='c010'>These three Places, before they were subdu’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>, boasted many
brave Temples and high Towers, whose lustre appear’d at a great distance, but
now being turn’d into Cloysters, they are inhabited by Monks and Nuns.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Salt made here of Earth, though not white, and onely fit to make Pickle of,
is Transported to many Places.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and pleasant Villages about <i>Mexico</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>About <i>Mexico</i> there are also several Villages, the chiefest of which are 1. <i>Mastitlan</i>,
a Town pleasantly seated upon the top of an huge Mountain, in the midst of
most delicate Groves and shady Woods, and reckon’d to contain no less than thirty
thousand Inhabitants in all, dwelling either in the City, or upon the sides of the
Mountain.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Antepecque</i>; this is a Town belonging to the Marquess <i>de Valle</i>, who is of
the Posterity of <i>Cortez</i>, and said to be seated in the most delicious place of all <i>New
Spain</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>Acapulco</i>, a Town seated upon the South-Sea, or <i>Mare del Zur</i>, yet belonging
to this Province. It is a haven-Town, and one of the most frequented upon
the South-Sea, situate upon a large and capacious Bay of about a League broad at
the Entrance, and affording many convenient Stations and Docks for Shipping.
At the bottom of the Bay Westward lieth the Town, with a strong Castle very opportunely
built, both for the command and security of the Port, well wall’d and
fortifi’d with Bulwarks, and having a constant Garrison of four hundred Soldiers
in it, or thereabouts. The reason whereof, I suppose, may be chiefly this, <i>viz.</i> that
from this Port there is the greatest Traffick and Entercourse held betwixt the <i>East</i>
and <i>West-Indies</i>, together with the <i>Philippine</i> Islands.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Silver Mynes.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey hath many rich Mynes of Silver in it, and some of Gold; the
chief of which are by <i>Herera</i> reported to be these, <i>viz.</i> 1. Those of <i>Puchuca</i>, fourteen
Leagues distant from <i>Mexico</i>. 2. Of <i>Tasco</i>. 3. <i>Talpuiana.</i> 4. <i>Cultepeque.</i> 5. <i>Zacualpa.</i>
6. <i>Zupanguo</i>, and divers others.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rest of the Villages are <i>Guatitlan</i>, <i>Tenyauca</i>, <i>Escapusalco</i>, <i>Tacuba</i>, and <i>Suchimilco</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Fountain.</div>

<p class='c010'>The neighboring Province <i>Xilotepeck</i>, which is exceeding fruitful, is also famous
for two Fountains, whereof one near the Village <i>Queretaro</i> produces boyling Water,
which when cool’d, is a wholsom Drink for Cattel: The other for four years is
full of Water, and for four years after it is empty; in great rainy Seasons it is
quite dry, and in droughty Weather it overflows.</p>

<p class='c010'>Between the Villages <i>Queretaro</i> and <i>San Juan</i>, is a Plain which extends it self seven
Leagues in breadth, and seven in length, besides two Leagues farther beyond <i>Quartero</i>,
where a hundred thousand Head of Cattel, and ten thousand Horses, find
plentiful Pasture.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The wonderful Mountain <i>Nevada</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Mountain <i>Nevada</i>, near the City <i>De los Angelos</i>, deserves no small admiration;
for it begins at thirty Leagues end to rise exceeding high, and being flat on
the top, hath a wide gaping Mouth, whose bottom is fathomless; from which at
Sun-rising and setting rises a Smoak up directly towards the Skie, but immediately
after spreading like a Plume of Feathers, it is dispers’d by the Wind, and no
more seen till it appears in a dusky Cloud. With the Smoak are also Ashes vomited
up; yet the Mountain is very pleasantly planted with lofty Cypress, Cedar, Oak,
and Pine-Trees. The neighboring Fields abound likewise with Wheat, Cotton,
and <i>Maiz</i>. There seldom appears any Rain here.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the Foot of this Mountain lies the Village <i>Tepecco</i>, famous for the Crystal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>and Allom gotten there. The Village <i>Ocotlan</i> is also maintain’d by the same: But
<i>Tuculala</i> by Gold-Mines, and fruitful Lands, which are twice a year shaken by
Earthquakes; wherefore the Inhabitants live not in Stone Houses, but in little
Straw Huts.</p>

<p class='c010'>South-Eastward from <i>Nerada</i> is excellent Sugar to be had, and on the Mountain
it self the famous Gum <i>Anime</i>, which drops out of a Tree call’d <i>Jetaiba</i>, which is always
green, with hard white Wood, a pale yellow speckled Bark, three long soft
Leaves hanging one over another on one Stalk, and the Fruit on the middle of the
Body. After the rainy Season is past in <i>October</i>, then they cut a Hole in the Body
of the Tree, out of which the Gum drops: it hath a pleasant smell, and is exceeding
good against the Head-ache occasion’d by Colds.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not far from hence appears the Valleys <i>Matalzingo</i> and <i>Atzompam</i>, which have
excellent Pastures, in which <i>Diego Nunnez de Camargo</i> bred forty thousand Sheep out
of two in ten years time.</p>

<p class='c010'>And these are the chiefest Towns, Villages, and Countreys, which surround the
famous City <i>Mexico</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The first Foundation of the City of <i>Mexico</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Concerning the erecting of this City, the <i>Indians</i> relate thus: That the seventh
Family of the <i>Navatlaca</i>’s, Extracted out of the Countrey <i>Aztlan</i>, rang’d up and
down not without thousands of Inconveniences, from one Countrey to another,
according to the Information which their Sages had given their Spirit <i>Viztliputli</i>,
till at last some of the Priests straying from the Army, or rather Multitude, got into
a Wilderness, full of Brambles and Thorns, and came at length to a Place where
was a Spring of clear Water, in which the Fishes glitter’d like Silver; where taking
up their repose that Night, their Spirit inform’d the oldest of them in a
Dream, that they should find thereabouts a <i>Tunal</i> Tree (whose Leaves grow out of
one another) under which, on a Stone, lay the Heart of the famous Sorcerer <i>Copil</i>:
This <i>Tunal</i> Tree should be discover’d by a Crane on the top of it, which in one
Foot should hold a Bird, and in the other a Bough of the Tree, near which they
were to build a City: The old Priest waking, and relating his Dream, every one
endeavor’d to find out the fore-mention’d Tree; at last they found it, by discovering
on the top a Crane, with spread-out Wings looking up towards the Sun, and
holding in his Claws a small Bird, invested with curious Feathers: Whereupon
they with all speed built a Chappel of Turf and Clods of Earth, and cover’d the
same with Canes, to keep their Idol from the Weather, resolving, so soon as they
could, to build him a better Temple.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lake on whose Isles they setled, abounded with Fish and Fowls, which they
exchang’d with the neighboring People for Stone and Mortar for the building of a
Temple for <i>Viztliputzli</i>, and a new City; to which they made a Cawsey in the Lake
<i>Laguna</i>, and divided it into four great Wards or Divisions, and subdivided them
again into lesser; over which they plac’d peculiar Idols, and order’d a Crane like
that which they had seen on the <i>Tunal</i> Tree to be their City Arms. The dividing
of the Wards occasion’d great dislike amongst the Grandees, judging those to whose
lot they fell, not to be worthy of them; wherefore deserting the same, and travelling
along the Lake <i>Laguna</i>, they setled themselves at last in a sandy Soil, which
they call’d <i>Tlattellulco</i>, and entertain’d a bitter hatred against their Countrey-men
who kept the four Wards of the new <i>Tenustitan</i>, doing them all the mischief they
could; wherefore the Assaulted were necessitated to chuse a King, that they might
be the better able to oppose their Enemies: But that they might not raise a Discontent
amongst themselves about electing a Governor, they judg’d it fittest to take
a Foreigner; amongst whom they found none so capable of so great an Office as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span><i>Acamapixtli</i>, Grand-son to the King of <i>Culhuacan</i>, whereupon sending Ambassadors
thither, they obtain’d their desires.</p>

<p class='c010'>The new King was no sooner Crown’d, but he settled all things in order with
great Prudence, insomuch, that <i>Mexico</i> grew daily to be more famous and fear’d:
But this sudden growth rais’d a jealousie amongst the Neighbors, who dreaded
their growing Power and Valor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Proceedings between the <i>Tapuneca</i>’s and <i>Mexicans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Tapunecans</i> who were also a valiant People, being the nearest to them, and
having <i>Azcapuzalco</i> for their chief City, made it their main design, utterly to root
out the <i>Mexicans</i>, before they grew to be more Populous and Potent; notwithstanding
they had hitherto receiv’d Tribute from them, for delivering the Lake
<i>Laguna</i> to them, which was a quantity of Timber and Plants; yet they demanded
not only more Tribute than formerly, but also in such a manner, as was thought
impossible to have been perform’d, which was, that those Plants which were formerly
brought to them, as growing on the Land, should be set in the Water, so as
to come floating to them, as they grew, to <i>Ascapuzalco</i>, which if they did not pay,
they should expect to be all put to the Sword. The <i>Mexicans</i> much amaz’d hereat,
and not knowing how to produce the demanded Plants, <i>Viztliputzli</i> inform’d the
oldest Priest, that the demands might be satisfi’d; and commanded him to throw
Earth on the Water, and to Sow Seed on the same, which at the usual time produc’d
<i>Maiz</i>, <i>Azi</i>, <i>Chias</i>, <i>Tomates</i>, and the like, with which the <i>Tapunecans</i> being satisfi’d, demand
next a Goose, and a Hen which laid Eggs, out of which the young ones
should appear, when on the floating Clods of Earth, the Nests came opposite to
<i>Azcapuzalco</i>, which by the advice of <i>Viztliputzli</i>, they perform’d fifty years one after
another. Mean while, <i>Acamapixtli</i> (who had inlarg’d <i>Mexico</i> with Streets, Palaces,
Temples, and Markets) dying, would not name any one to succeed him, but left
the choice of the Election to the Commonalty, who Crown’d his Son <i>Vitzilovitli</i>,
and Marry’d him to the King of <i>Tapunecans</i> Daughter, that by that means they
might gain his friendship, and be eas’d of their strange Annual Tribute: Whereupon
<i>Ayauchigual</i>, the King of <i>Tapunecans</i> Daughter being Marry’d to <i>Vitzilovitli</i>, was
within twelve Moneths deliver’d of a Son, which the Grand-father call’d <i>Chimalpopoca</i>,
which signifies <i>A Gun which gives Smoke</i>, and afterwards was satisfi’d with
two Geese, and some Fish yearly from the <i>Mexicans</i>, onely as an Acknowledgment
that they inhabited his Countrey. <i>Chimalpopoca</i> loosing his Parents, in his tenth
year was Crown’d King, with a Bowe and Arrows in his left Hand, and a Woodden
Sword in the right: Soon after he oblig’d his Mothers Father to be kind to the
<i>Mexicans</i>, for they being in great want for fresh Water, he had leave by Channels
to bring the same out of the Mountain <i>Chapultepec</i>, a League distant from <i>Mexico</i>;
to which purpose they made a Pipe of Planks, and hollow Trees joyn’d together
with Clay, quite through the Lake; but this Pipe not being teight and durable,
and the fresh Water by that means mixing with the Salt, they sent Agents to <i>Azcapuzalco</i>,
to request Stones, Mortar, and Work-men to make a substantial Sewer:
This message was ill resented by the Council of <i>Azcapuzalco</i>; <i>What</i>, (said they) <i>do
the</i> Mexicans <i>think, shall a rambling company of people, which on Charity live in anothers
Countrey, Command those that Govern them to be their Servants?</i> This grudge went so far,
that at last they took a Resolution without the King’s knowledge, (for he was suspected,
because of his Grand-chil’d <i>Chimalpopoca</i>) to forbid all manner of Trade
with the <i>Mexicans</i>; nay, to endeavor utterly to root them out; yet some judg’d,
that they ought to spare <i>Chimalpopoca</i>, while others on the contrary said, <i>That he
ought to be destroy’d, because his Father being a</i> Mexican, <i>he would to the utmost of his Power
defend his People</i>; which last being approv’d of, so troubled the King of the <i>Tapunecans</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>that he dy’d of grief; for the Design being soon after put into execution, and
the <i>Tapuneca</i>’s breaking in the Night into <i>Chimalpopoca</i>’s Palace, Murder’d him;
which Murder made the <i>Mexicans</i> thirst for revenge; whereupon, setting themselves
wholly against the <i>Tapunecans</i>, they enter’d into a League with <i>Vezcuco</i>, and
<i>Culhuacan</i>, and chose <i>Izcoalt</i>, for his great Valor, for their King; notwithstanding
<i>Acamapixtli</i> had begotten him on a Slave.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Izcoalts</i> success against the <i>Tapanecas</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Izcoalt</i> was no sooner Crown’d, but he made great preparation for a War, though
against every ones Opinion, because of the Populousness of the <i>Tapunecans</i>; yet it
was concluded on, that they should request Peace, and a place to inhabit on the
main Continent, that so they might remove from the Isles: This Request they
thought could not be deny’d them in <i>Azcapuzalco</i>, provided the <i>Mexicans</i> brought
their Gods thither, and wholly conform’d themselves to the manners of the <i>Tapunecans</i>,
for otherwise they could expect nothing but utter Ruine: Yet though every
one else imbrac’d the Proposal, <i>Tlacaellel</i>, the King’s Nephew, stiffly oppos’d it,
alleging, that it did not agree with the <i>Mexicans</i> quality, to make so mean and slavish
a Proffer; and that they had best consider, first if there were no other means
to be found: and that he would willingly venture his Life in going to <i>Azcapuzalco</i>,
as a Spie, to pry into their whole Designs and Intentions, which was perform’d accordingly;
and soon after returning, he brought information, that the <i>Tapunecans</i>
were making great preparations for War, and made no mention at all of Peace;
which news struck a general fear into all Peoples Hearts; many desiring that they
might save themselves by flight; but <i>Izcoalt</i> putting fresh courage into them, made
an agreement with the People, that if he was beaten by the <i>Tapunecans</i>, they should
eat him up; but if he prov’d Conqueror, they should all be at his Command; to
which all consenting, they boldly march’d with their King to the City <i>Azcapuzalco</i>.
The Front of the Army consisting of the prime Nobility, was led by <i>Tlacaellel</i>, and
the Rear <i>Izcoalt</i> brought up, who was also to give the sign on a Drum, when they
should fall upon the Enemies; who having ten Men to the <i>Mexicans</i> one, suddenly
Sally’d out of the Gates, where they were so briskly entertain’d by <i>Tlacaellel</i>, that
in a confus’d manner they soon ran back into the City, whither the Conqueror
pursuing them, got within the Gates, where he put all to the Sword which he
could meet with; some fled to a steep neighboring Mountain, whither being also
follow’d, they threw down their Arms, and begg’d Quarter, to serve the <i>Mexicans</i>
as Slaves, which was granted them, whilst <i>Izcoalt</i> found an unvaluable Mass of
Treasure in <i>Azcapuzalco</i>, and distributed the Conquer’d Countrey amongst those
who had behav’d themselves best.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Conquest made the neighboring People jealous of the <i>Mexicans</i>, whose Success
and growing Power they dreaded.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Cuyoacans</i> utterly subdu’d by <i>Tlacaellel</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Towns <i>Tacuba</i> and <i>Cuyoacan</i>, though they had Governors of their own, yet
were subject to the <i>Tapunecans</i>, whose General advising those of <i>Azcapuzalco</i> to try another
Encounter, they took up Arms again; but before it came to a Battel, the
<i>Cuyoacans</i> play’d a subtile trick with the <i>Mexicans</i>, for inviting them to an Idolatrous
Feast, after they had Eat, Drunk, and Danc’d, they forc’d them to put on Womens
Apparel, to their no small disgrace and ignomy; which remain’d not unreveng’d,
for the <i>Mexicans</i> made a Poysonous Fume in the Gates of <i>Cuyoacan</i>, which
made Women with Child to Miscarry, and many to fall dangerously sick; yet lastly,
both Parties march’d into the Fields, where whilst <i>Izcoalt</i> was elsewhere ingag’d,
<i>Tlacaellel</i> marching about, came upon the backs of the <i>Cuyoacans</i> with such
eagerness, that they fled to a strong Temple, which soon after was set on fire by
<i>Tlacaellel</i>, who pursu’d the Enemy ten Leagues.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>This Conquest stir’d up the <i>Suchimilcos</i>, the first Family of the <i>Navatlaca</i>’s, to stop
the proceedings of the <i>Mexicans</i>, that they might not, as they had already done to
others, fall upon them; to which purpose they thought to surprize the Conquering
Army; but <i>Tlacaellel</i> who led the Van, march’d in good Order to meet the <i>Suchimilcos</i>,
fell resolutely upon their whole Army, and after a short conflict, put them
to flight, and took the City <i>Suchimilco</i> for <i>Izcoalt</i>, who being Crown’d King there,
Commanded the Conquer’d to make a direct Road betwixt <i>Suchimilco</i> and <i>Mexico</i>,
of four Leagues long, both, that a Trade might the easier be drove between these
two Cities, and to keep them the better in awe: Notwithstanding these examples,
<i>Cuytlavacan</i>, a City built at the Lake <i>Laguna</i>, trusting to the abundance of Boats,
which the Citizens knew how to use with great dexterity, daily molested <i>Mexico</i>
with them by Water, whereupon <i>Izcoalt</i> resolv’d to send his Victorious Army thither,
but <i>Tlacaellel</i> opposing the same, promis’d to subdue the Rebelling City with
a considerable number of Boys, which had skill in the managing of a <i>Canoo</i>, which
being permitted him, he accordingly made himself Master of <i>Cuytlavacan</i>, from
whence the Boys brought a great Booty, and divers Prisoners, whom they sent as
an Offering to <i>Vitzlipultzli</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Tezcuco</i> submits to the <i>Mexicans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>These unheard of Victories being spread far and near, mov’d <i>Tezcuco</i> after several
Skirmishes and Conflicts with <i>Tlacaellel</i>, to submit to the <i>Mexican</i> King, who
chose the Governor thereof for his Prime Councellor. <i>Izcoalt</i> Deceasing, after
having Reign’d twelve years, his Son <i>Muteczuma</i> was chosen his Successor; the Election
and Coronation being perform’d after the following manner.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Coronation of <i>Muteczuma</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The new King mantled in Tygers Skins, was led into the chief Temple before a
Hearth, on which burnt Fire both Night and Day; not far from which stood the
Throne, where sitting down, he Offer’d Blood, which was taken from his Cheeks,
Ears, and Legs; after which, an Orator Congratulated him, in the name of the
Nobility; which done, they ended the Solemnity in a great Dinner, Fire-Works,
and Dancing: At the same time it was establish’d, that all Future Coronations
should be kept with an Offering of Provisions, fetch’d by the King out of the Enemies
Countrey: wherefore <i>Muteczuma</i> going to the Countrey <i>Chalco</i>, took several
of the Natives, whose reaking Hearts he Offer’d to <i>Viztlipuztli</i>: Which done, the
Coronation follow’d, to which an innumerable company of People came flocking
from all the neighboring Provinces: Those which were Tributaries, brought
Presents with them, before which the Heralds carry’d the Coats of Arms belonging
to the Nobility of <i>Mexico</i>, in a good order.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Muteczuma</i>’s Brother taken Prisoner by those of <i>Chalco</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>An example of great Fidelity.</div>

<p class='c010'>Soon after the King’s Coronation, he march’d and fell upon <i>Chalco</i>, the Inhabitants
of which defended themselves very Valiantly, took <i>Muteczuma</i>’s Brother,
among several other Prisoners; to whom the Conquerors proffer’d the Government;
which at first he refus’d, but at last accepted of on this condition, that a
high Mast should be erected with a Scaffold on the top, which made every one
suppose, that <i>Muteczuma</i>’s Brother did in that manner aim at a high Election, but
he at the appointed time, getting on the top of the Mast, call’d with a loud voice,
and spake to the taken <i>Mexicans</i> which were there present to this effect: <i>Chalco
seeks to set me on the Throne, the Heavens will not permit it; learn by me rather to die, than
to live and be guilty of Treason to your Countrey</i>: which he had no sooner said, but with
some Flowers which he held in his Hand, threw himself down from the Scaffold,
which so inrag’d the <i>Chalcoans</i>, that they immediately slew all the other <i>Mexicans</i>
that were there present; which not long after was reveng’d by <i>Muteczuma</i>, who
not onely subdu’d <i>Chalco</i>, but several other Provinces, leaving onely <i>Tlascala</i> unattempted,
that the <i>Mexicans</i> might have a neighboring Enemy to fetch Prisoners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>from for their Offerings, and also by Skirmishing with them, train up their Youth
in Martial Discipline.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_290.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>Thus his Predecessors and he, having Conquer’d divers Provinces, insomuch
that he was now become absolute Emperor over a vast Tract of Land, he resolv’d
to settle the same in good order; to which purpose he erected Courts of Judicature,
with good Laws; built a stately Palace and Temple; ordain’d several Customs
to be observ’d in Religion; which done, and having Reign’d twenty eight
years, he Deceasing, left <i>Ticocic</i> for his Successor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the Temple <i>Cu</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The foremention’d Temple was call’d <i>Cu</i>, being built of Stone, in form like a
Serpent, of an exceeding bigness, in the middle thereof there was a spacious open
place, and round about it Habitations, two Stories high, the lowermost for the
Inferior Priests, and the uppermost for the High Priests; in this place also above ten
thousand People Danc’d in a Circle, on all high Feasts; four great Gates fac’d the
like number of broad Streets, each two Leagues long: On the outmost Gate stood
large Images, the Front of black Stones, Painted between each Lay with red and
yellow Colours, no less Beautiful than Artificial: On each corner of the Temple
were plac’d two Marble Statues of <i>Indians</i>, sitting with their Arms stretch’d
out, and holding a Candle, and on their Heads Plumes of Feathers: Thirty high
steps led up to a round place, set about with Deaths-Heads, which was a Stage appointed
for the slaughter of those, whose Hearts were to be Offer’d to the Diabolical
gods, and whose Heads, their Bodies being eaten, were brought back to the Priests,
who hung them under the Stage, where every Head hanging till it dropp’d off, the
vacant place was immediately supply’d with a fresh Head. At the end of the
Stage stood two Chappels, cover’d like a <i>Cardinal</i>’s-Cap, in one of which sate the
Image of <i>Tiztlputzli</i>, and in the other <i>Tlaloc</i>, to which led a hundred and twenty
Stone steps.</p>

<p class='c010'>But besides this stately Temple <i>Cu</i>, <i>Mexico</i> boasted nine more, standing not far
asunder in a large Plain, all adorn’d with curious Imagery, and set out with large
Pillars, each being Dedicated to a peculiar Idol, and built with magnificent Apartments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>for the Priests to lodge in; the chiefest of them Dedicated to an Idol
call’d <i>Tezeatlipuca</i>, or <i>Lord of the Humble</i>. This Temple was ascended to by eighty
steps, and had before it a spacious Court; within a low and broad Gate appear’d
a high Vail, which open’d into a spacious square Hall, hung with Tapestry, at
the end whereof stood large Images, and beyond which were several Rooms,
in which Assemblies met, Scholars were taught, Judges sate, and Priests Resided.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Tlacaellel</i> resigns the Kingdoms to <i>Ticocic</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Axayacan</i> chosen King.</div>

<p class='c010'>But to return again to <i>Muteczuma</i>, his Funeral was no sooner finish’d, but the
four Prime Councellors were attended by the Commissioners of <i>Tezcuco</i> and <i>Tacuba</i>,
in order to the Election of a new King: <i>Tlacaellel</i> being the chief amongst the
Dukes, was by a general Vote Saluted King, as being most worthy thereof, for
his special Services shown in behalf of the Empire of <i>Mexico</i>: But he humbly refusing
the same, was desir’d to Nominate another, whereupon he making choice
of <i>Ticocic</i>, <i>Muteczuma</i>’s eldest Son; the Council immediately bor’d a hole through
his Nose, and hung an Emrauld in the same. But before he receiv’d the Crown,
he was forc’d, according to the Custom, to fetch in some of his Enemies for an Offering,
which though he perform’d, yet he lost more <i>Mexicans</i> than he took Prisoners,
not without sufficient testimony of Cowardise; which being ill resented by
the People, he was Poyson’d in the fourth year of his Reign, and succeeded by his
Brother <i>Axayaca</i>, by the appointment of <i>Tlacaellel</i>; who having attain’d to a great
Age, and left the Charge of his Children to the new King, departed this Life, to
the great sorrow and grief of the whole Empire; by the States whereof he was Bury’d
with great Solemnity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>His Victory against the <i>Teguantepecks</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the mean time, <i>Axayaca</i> went with a considerable Army to the remote Province
<i>Teguantepek</i>, to fetch Prisoners to be Offer’d at his Coronation; and marching
before alone, Challeng’d his Antagonist, the King, to a single Combat, which
he refus’d, and chose rather to fall upon <i>Axayaca</i> with all his Forces; whereupon,
the <i>Mexicans</i> cunningly feign’d flight, ambuscaded themselves till the Enemies pursuing
them, gave them their desir’d advantage, for rushing out of their Ambuscade,
they set upon the <i>Teguantepecks</i>, so disorder’d, that they easily put them to flight,
and had the pursuit of them as far as <i>Guatulco</i>, a noted Haven upon the South-Sea;
from whence <i>Axayaca</i> returning Victor, receiv’d a Crown for a Reward; yet
notwithstanding these Proofs of his Valor, the Lord of <i>Tlatellulco</i> Challeng’d him;
whereupon he sent Agents thither, with proffers, that since the Citizens of <i>Tlatellulco</i>
were of one Blood with the <i>Mexicans</i>, whom they deserted upon the dividing
of the Wards and Towns, just before the Election of the first King <i>Acamapixtli</i>,
they should, if they pleas’d, be receiv’d anew into fellowship and alliance with the
<i>Mexicans</i>, acknowledging one and the same King for their Supreme Head and Governor:
But the Ambassadors being scorn’d and laugh’d at for their proffers, returning,
related the same to <i>Axayaca</i>, who immediately marching thither to take
revenge, sent part of his Army to fall on the Enemy by Water; whilst himself
falling upon them by Land, put the Lord of <i>Tlatellulco</i>, with his whole Army, to
flight, which was so closely pursu’d, that they forc’d their way into the City with
them, put the Governor to Death, and laid the Town in Ashes; those which
went by Water, having had no less success.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Autzol</i> succeeds him.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Axayaca</i>, after eleven years Reign, Deceasing, bequeath’d his Crown to <i>Autzol</i>,
who sought to promote his Election by ingaging with the mighty Province <i>Quaxutatlan</i>,
whose Inhabitants, though but a little before, they had been so bold as to
demand Tribute of the <i>Mexicans</i>, yet terrifi’d at the approach of <i>Autzol</i>’s Army,
fled over an Arm of the Sea, where they had been secure, had not <i>Autzol</i> invented a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>floating Isle of Planks, by which he got over his whole Army; upon which the
amaz’d  <i>Quaxututlans</i> immediately submitted themselves to the <i>Mexicans</i>, who pursuing
their Victory, extended their Dominions to <i>Guatimala</i>, over a Tract of three
hundred Leagues.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Autzol</i>’s Generosity and Magnificence.</div>

<p class='c010'>The new King having now subdu’d all his Enemies, and made himself glorious
by his Victories, was also ambitious to be as much extoll’d for his Generosity
and Magnificence; to which purpose he distributed all the Wealth which was
brought unto him from the neighboring Countreys, amongst the Poor and the Nobility;
to the first he gave Clothes and Provisions; to the last, Plumes of Feathers
and Arms. Moreover he caus’d all mean Houses to be pull’d down and new ones
to be built in their places. Lastly, he consulted how to bring fresh Water into
<i>Mexico</i>, which was plac’d in a brackish Soil: Upon this Design he was so bent,
that when one of his Sages disswaded him from it, alledging, <i>That the Water would
drown the City</i>, he, in stead of following his Advice, banish’d him his Presence, and
upon his flying to <i>Cuyaocun</i>, caus’d him to be fetch’d from thence and Executed.
Then prosecuting his Design, he cut the Ditch before <i>Cuyaocun</i>, by which means
great store of fresh Water came flowing into the Lake <i>Laguna</i>, which the Priests
welcom’d with strange Ceremonies; for some perfum’d the Water, others Offer’d
Quails Blood, whilst others play’d on several Musical Instruments, with many
other Ceremonies, which are at large describ’d in the ancient <i>Mexican</i> Chronicles,
kept in the <i>Vatican</i> Library at <i>Rome</i>. But the Prophecy of the Executed Sorcerer
was in a manner fulfill’d; for the Water overwhelm’d a great part of <i>Mexico</i>, and
divided the City into Isles: But to prevent farther Mischief, <i>Autzoll</i> caus’d Banks
to be rais’d, and Channels digg’d; and not long after, in the eleventh Year of his
Reign, he deceas’d: After which the <i>Mexican</i> Kingdom tended towards its period,
as the ensuing Story will declare.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amongst the <i>Mexican</i> Nobility, <i>Mutexuma</i>, a melancholy Man, yet very prudent,
who resided in a stately Apartment near the great Temple <i>Cu</i>, that there he might
the better converse with <i>Viztlipuztli</i>, was elected King; which he no sooner heard,
but fled from hence: but being found out, he was against his will led to the Grand
Assembly, and from thence to the holy Hearth, where for an Offering he drew Blood
out of his Cheeks, Ears, and Legs; and, according to an ancient Custom, the <i>Council
of State</i> boring a Hole in his Nose, hung an Emerauld in the same; after which
the Lord of <i>Tescuco</i> saluted him with a Speech; which (since it is mention’d by
<i>Joseph d’ Acosta</i>, together with several other Speeches of Congratulation to their
Kings, which were taught to Schollars, to make them expert in their Language)
it will not be amiss to be annexed here, that of many this one may serve for a pattern
of the <i>Mexicans</i> Eloquence, which is as followeth:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Lord of <i>Tescuco</i> his Speech to <i>Muteczuma</i>.</div>

<p class='c017'>“The great happiness, most noble <i>Muteczuma</i>, which is befall’n this Realm by
your Election, may easily be conjectur’d from the general joy, none besides
your self being able to undergo an Office, in the management whereof so
much Prudence is requir’d: It is a most certain testimony that God loves <i>Mexico</i>,
that he hath given its Inhabitants understanding to make such a Choice. Who
can doubt, but that you who have expatiated through the Heavens, and convers’d
with <i>Viztlipuztli</i>, may easily Govern us Mortals on Earth? Who can despair,
but that the Vertue inclos’d within your Breast, will extend to the Widows
and Orphans? Therefore rejoyce, O <i>Mexico</i>; the Heavens have granted us a
Prince without Vice; Merciful, and not a Violator of the Laws; Affable,
not despising common Conversation. And you, O King, let not this great Preferment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>occasion any alteration in your so long known Vertues: The Crown
breeds care for the publick good; the troubles thereof must extend over the
whole Realm, and every one in the Realm.”</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Preparation for the Coronation of <i>Muteczuma</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>His Grandeur.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The ruine of the <i>Mexican</i> Empire prognosticated.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Muteczuma</i> having heard out the Speech, would willingly have answer’d the
same, but could not utter a word for Tears, which gush’d from his Eyes. Before
he went out to fetch Prisoners for Offerings at his Coronation, he first setled his
Houshold Affairs. And whereas till this time the Kings had been serv’d in their
Palaces by ordinary Citizens, he took Knights, and the chiefest of the Nobility,
intending thereby to make a distinction between the Nobility and the common
People, and add more Majesty to the Royal Dignity. This done, <i>Muteczuma</i>
marching against a certain rebellious Province, fetch’d a considerable number of
People to be Offer’d to <i>Viztupuztli</i>. At his Return the Coronation-Day was appointed,
against which thousands of People came to <i>Mexico</i>; even their very Enemies
of <i>Tlascala</i>, <i>Mechoacan</i>, and <i>Tepeaca</i>, which were never conquer’d by the <i>Mexicans</i>,
flock’d thither in great numbers. All those Countreys which were under
Tribute bringing unvaluable Treasures, came in vast Multitudes, which so throng’d
the City, that the very tops of the Houses were fill’d with Spectators, no King in
<i>Mexico</i> ever going to the Throne in such splendor; nor was ever any King so
much fear’d by his Subjects, none of the common People daring to look in his
Face; neither did he ever set Foot on the Ground, but was always carried in a
Chair on the Shoulders of his prime Nobility; he never wore a Suit of Clothes
but once, nor ever us’d a Cup or Dish after it was once foul’d; he strictly maintain’d
the Laws which he had made, and often went himself in a Disguise, to make
a strict enquiry after all Affairs whatsoever; by which means the <i>Mexican</i> Power
was now arriv’d to the highest top: but, as other Realms, grown top-heavy with
good Fortune, turn at last topsie-turvy, just such a Misfortune befell <i>Mexico</i>; but
not without several fore-running signs of its destruction: for in the City <i>Cholola</i>
their God <i>Quezalcoalt</i> inform’d them, that a strange People were coming to take
possession of the <i>Mexican</i> Dominions; and their Soothsayers prognosticated the same,
for which <i>Muteczuma</i> committed them all to Prison, and doubtless had put them all
to death, had not they escap’d with the help of the Master of their diabolical Art;
and though they escap’d themselves, yet their Wives and Children were all put to
death upon the King’s Command: Soon after which appear’d a mighty Comet,
or blazing Star for a whole year together; the great Temple <i>Cu</i> was set on Fire,
and burnt to the Ground none knew how; the Water which was thrown on the
same to quench it, burnt like Brimstone; in the Skie appear’d three fiery Heads at
noon-day, and out of a long Tail shot Sparks on the Earth; the <i>Laguna</i>, between
<i>Mexico</i> and <i>Texcuco</i>, began to swell into a Tide, which turn’d some Houses topsie-turvy;
a shrill Voice was heard in the Night crying on the Water, <i>Children, your
ruine is at hand; whither shall I carry you that you may not be lost?</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>A miraculous story of a Bird.</div>

<p class='c010'>No less strange is what <i>d’ Acosta</i> relates of a Bird presented to <i>Muteczuma</i>, not
unlike a Crane, which the Fishermen had taken on the <i>Laguna</i>; on the shining
Forehead of which there appear’d the resemblance of two Armies Engag’d, and one
defeated by the other, and that whilst the Sages, call’d to interpret the meaning
hereof, sat in Consultation, the Bird vanish’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Another of a Country-man.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, there goes a Tradition, That a Countrey-man being at his Labor,
was taken up by an Eagle, and carried through the Air into a gloomy Cave, where
a Man lay fast asleep snoaring, when on a sudden he heard a Voice afar off, saying,
<i>Do you know that Man?</i> whereupon the Countrey-man taking special notice of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>dormant Man, knew him, by the Royal Apparel, to be <i>Mutexuma</i>; after which
the Voice was heard again, saying, <i>How soundly doth he sleep: the time is coming
which provides Punishments for many Crimes; burn the Snoarer with the Torch which he holds
in his Hands, he will feel no pain</i>: Not long after he being inform’d hereof, and looking
on his Thigh, found the same burnt, to his no small amazement.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>News of the arrival of the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet.</div>

<p class='c010'>Having now possess’d the Throne fourteen years, he receiv’d news of a
Fleet, and therewith a Draught of the Men and Vessels painted on Cloth. This
startling him, he immediately advis’d with his Council, who judg’d it convenient
to secure the Coast along the Southern Ocean with strong Watches; yet nevertheless
<i>Ferdinand Cortesius</i> Landed with five hundred Foot and sixty Horse, took the
City <i>Potanchanum</i>, march’d through the Countrey <i>Sicuchimalar</i> to <i>Tascalleca</i>, where
they had a sharp Conflict, in which the <i>Spaniards</i> were in great danger; and had
not they had six Field-Pieces with them, which did as much affright as hurt the
<i>Indians</i>, they had without doubt been cut off there. In <i>Chiurutecal</i> they were in as
much danger; for certainly the <i>Spanish</i> Army had been set upon in the Night, had
not a Woman inform’d them of it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Muteczuma</i> committed to Prison by <i>Cortesius</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Mean while <i>Muteczuma</i> consulted with his Sorcerers to destroy <i>Cortesius</i> by Charms,
who then was marching through <i>Chalco</i>, whereupon a considerable number of Sorcerers
went thither to the top of a high Mountain, where, as they were beginning their
Incantations and Charms, their Idol <i>Tezcalipuca</i> appear’d to them; and in an angry
manner told them, That <i>Muteczuma</i> should lose his Crown and Life; and to confirm
his words, he shew’d them a dreadful spectacle; for looking about, they saw
the City in a light flame. This being told to <i>Muteczuma</i>, he resolv’d to make himself
as secure as he could, and went to meet <i>Cortesius</i> with costly Presents, delivering
him the Crown in the presence of all his Council; to which purpose he took one
<i>Marina</i>, experienc’d in the <i>Castilian</i> Tongue, with him for his Interpreter; all things
then seeming to end in Friendship. But they continu’d not long in that state;
for <i>Cortesius</i>, whose whole Design was to bring <i>Mexico</i> under the <i>Spaniards</i> Subjection,
not long after accus’d <i>Muteczuma</i>, that <i>Coalcopoca</i> had on his Commands
storm’d the new <i>Spanish</i> City <i>Vera Crux</i>, which he could no way excuse; and notwithstanding
<i>Muteczuma</i> deliver’d him <i>Coalcopoca</i>, with fifteen of his Nobles Prisoners,
who were all burnt with green Wood; yet he was committed Prisoner, to
the great discontent of the <i>Mexicans</i>, who said, “That they were now come to a
fine pass, to be thus fool’d by a few Strangers, who had imprison’d their King,
trampled upon their ancient Images, endeavor’d to murther them all, and in despite
of them brought their mortal Enemies, the <i>Tascaltecans</i> and <i>Guazuzingans</i>, into
<i>Mexico</i>.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cortesius</i> marches against <i>Velasquez</i>’s Party.</div>

<p class='c010'>About this time there were certain Ships come to <i>Vera Crux</i>, which was a new
Port-Town of this Countrey, that the <i>Spaniards</i> had built since their coming thither,
and had Landed near upon a thousand Men; which was an Accident that had
like to have spoil’d the Design of <i>Cortesius</i> and all his Company at <i>Mexico</i>, these
Men being sent by <i>James Velasquez</i>; Governor of <i>Cuba</i>, expressly against <i>Cortesius</i> and
his Men, upon pretence that they had acted not conformably to the Commission
which they had receiv’d from him, and gave him no account of their proceedings;
which in a great measure was true: for it must be confess’d, that <i>Cortesius</i> and his
Men finding themselves to have fall’n upon an Adventure that was certainly rich
and good, and having got such footing and interest in the Countrey already, by
their Success and Victories, and chiefly by their Confederacy with so many of the
Natives and People of the Countrey, revolted to them, did almost at first, by a general
consent, renounce their Commission, and dependency upon <i>Velasquez</i>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>profess’d to act immediately from and for the King of <i>Spain</i>. What pretences they
had for such a Resolution, seemingly at least irregular, is not so well known. Whatever
they were, they proceed in it, and the whole Company (excepting onely some
few, who yet went along with the rest) chuse <i>Cortesius</i> anew for their Commander
in chief, and appoint likewise by common consent, all other Officers of Justice,
both Civil and Military, among themselves: and to give the better colour at Court
to their Proceedings, they send <i>Portocorrero</i> and <i>Monteio</i>, two of their Principals, into
<i>Spain</i>, with a rich and noble Present to the Emperor, both to make report of the
State of the Countrey, and to procure immediate Commission from his Majesty, to
proceed; after which they advance towards Mexico, as hath been said. <i>Velasquez</i>,
being at <i>Cuba</i>, and understanding their Proceedings, labor’d to intercept both their
Messengers and Present, but could not; and therefore sent <i>Pamphilius Narvaez</i> with
eleven Ships, and about nine hundred or a thousand Men to apprehend <i>Cortesius</i>,
and oppose his Proceedings. This hapned about the time that the Differences were
but newly calm’d betwixt the <i>Spaniards</i> and the People of <i>Mexico</i>; and though it oblig’d
<i>Cortesius</i> to leave the City in a wavering and unsetled condition, yet he took
such order, that <i>Muteczuma</i> still remain’d under the Guard of the <i>Spaniards</i> as before,
assisted with thousands of their Friends of <i>Tlascalla</i>, and he himself taking the rest,
and some few <i>Spaniards</i> along with him, with undaunted courage and resolution
marches against <i>Narvaez</i>: and such was his good fortune, that not onely <i>Narvaez</i> became
his Prisoner without much blood-shed, but likewise all his Men joyn’d with
him in his Design, through the favour of the Chancery or supream Court of <i>St. Domingo</i>,
and by the procurement of the Licentiat <i>Vasquez de Ayllon</i>, a Judge of it, who
was sent with <i>Narvaez</i> to accommodate the Differences. With this Recruit <i>Cortesius</i>
marches back again to <i>Mexico</i>; but at his coming finds things in a very bad condition;
for the Citizens, gather’d together under the Command of one <i>Quicuxtemoc</i>,
had recourse to Arms, and for three days and three Nights vex’d the <i>Spaniards</i>
with continual Stormings, notwithstanding what-ever Commands they had to the
contrary from their imprison’d King, who at last, looking out of a Window,
endeavoring to appease them, was hurt with a Stone, of which he soon after died,
as they say, who would not have the <i>Spaniards</i> thought to have murder’d him, as the
<i>Mexicans</i> say they did, with divers other Noble-men, and some of his Children, the
very Night they fled. However it were, not long after his Death, out of extream
necessity, and chiefly for want of Victuals, the <i>Spaniards</i> were forc’d to leave the City
in the night-time, and with the loss of four hundred and fifty of their Men, who
were either slain or taken Prisoners at the passing of a Draw-bridge, the rest making
a heavy Retreat to their Friends at <i>Tlascalla</i>. There is standing at this day in
<i>Mexico</i>, upon the place where so many of them were kill’d, a certain Hermitage,
which they call <i>Los Martyres</i>, or <i>The Hermitage of the Martyrs</i>, though but improperly,
if upon that occasion, as one of their own Writers confesses, though he alledges no
other reason.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Mexico</i> taken by the <i>Spaniards</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Retreat of the <i>Spaniards</i> out of <i>Mexico</i> hapned to be upon the tenth of <i>July</i>
after mid-night, in the Year 1520. which the <i>Spaniards</i> at <i>Mexico</i> call <i>The Doleful
Night</i>. Nevertheless the undaunted <i>Cortesius</i> being got, though with much difficulty
and trouble, by reason of the pursuit of the <i>Mexicans</i> for a good part of the
Way, to his sure Friends of <i>Tlascalla</i>, neither lost his Courage, nor gave over his Resolution
of yet gaining <i>Mexico</i>, especially the way being now laid open, and sufficient
occasion given by the Death of <i>Muteczuma</i>, and the provocations of the
<i>Mexicans</i> themselves, to make himself absolute and sole Lord of the Place: wherefore
having sent for, and procur’d a competent Supply of fresh Soldiers from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span><i>Santo Domingo</i>, or <i>Hispaniola</i>, <i>Almeria</i>, <i>Cuba</i>, and other places, being in all nine hundred
Foot, eight hundred Horse, and seventeen Pieces of Ordnance; he joyns himself
with the Auxiliary Forces of <i>Tlascalla</i>, which were no less than a hundred thousand
Men, Arm’d with Bowes and Arrows: and with this Army marches again
towards <i>Mexico</i>, and Besieges it both by Land and Water, <i>viz.</i> with the help of
thirteen <i>Brigantines</i> or <i>Galliots</i>, which he had built upon the Lake, and six thousand
<i>Canoos</i>, or little Boats, which his Friends and Confederates had procur’d him. By
which means, and by his Army on Land, in a short time he cut off all Provision
from the City, and after a Siege of full three Months or more, and a most stout and
obstinate resistance made by the People within, in which they are said to have lost
above a hundred thousand Men, beside those which perish’d by Famine, Sickness,
or otherwise, he took it by Storm upon <i>Tuesday</i> the thirteenth of <i>August 1521.</i> Sackt
it first, and then burnt it to the Ground; yet afterwards he caus’d it to be Re-built
again, far more Beautiful than at first it was; as in due place we shall further see.
They speak not of above fifty <i>Spaniards</i> slain during the whole Siege, six Horses,
and not many <i>Tlascaltecans</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cortez</i> advanc’d to Honors.</div>

<p class='c010'>In this manner, and with so little Charges to the Conqueror, there fell to the
Crown of <i>Spain</i> the richest and goodliest Kingdom (one of them) of the whole
World, <i>viz.</i> the Kingdom of <i>Mexico</i>, which the Conquerors presently nam’d <i>New
Spain</i>; and in reference to which name, the <i>Catholick King</i> hath ever since stil’d himself
in the plural number <i>Hispaniarum Rex</i>, or <i>King of both Spains</i>; and all by the Valor,
Prudence, admirable Resolution, and happy Conduct of <i>Cortez</i>; who was at first
but a private Adventurer in the <i>American</i> Plantations and Discoveries, though otherwise
a Gentleman of a good Family in <i>Spain</i>, born at <i>Medellin</i> in the Country of
<i>Estramedura</i>. The Emperor <i>Charles</i> the Fifth, who was also then King of <i>Spain</i>, for
his great Services, endow’d him deservedly with many great and rich Territories
in the Provinces of <i>Tlascalla</i>, <i>Mechoacan</i>, and other parts thereabouts, made him
Marquess of the Valley, <i>viz.</i> of <i>Guaxata</i>, (which is his chief Title) a rich and flourishing
Province of that Countrey, Captain General, or Commander in Chief, of
all the Military Forces of <i>New-Spain</i>, and General Discoverer of all the Maritime
parts and Coasts of <i>America</i> towards the South-Sea, assigning him in propriety the
twelfth part of whatsoever should be discover’d, to him and his Heirs for ever; but
deny’d him the Government of <i>Mexico</i> out of reason of State, though ’tis said, he
much desir’d it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The grand Haven <i>Acapulco</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Among the famous Havens which lie along the South Sea, and Northern Ocean
the chiefest is <i>Acapulco</i> before-mention’d, whither all Merchandize is sent to be
transported to <i>China</i>, which is above two thousand Leagues distant from thence; in
which Voyage they generally spend fourteen Months; four Sail, each of eight hundred
Tun, appointed for this Trade; generally two of them set Sail to <i>China</i> in <i>March</i>,
and returning in Summer, have no sooner drop’d their Anchors, but the other two
set out from <i>Acapulco</i>, from whence the way by Land to <i>Mexico</i>, is seventy two
Leagues over steep Mountains, dangerous Rocks, and several Rivers; the chiefest
whereof are, first, <i>Del Papagayo</i>, or <i>De las Balsas</i>, which runs exceeding strong, which
the <i>Indians</i> cross on bundles of Canes ty’d upon <i>Callabashes</i>: Next <i>San Francisco</i>,
which though the biggest, yet hath many shallow places to wade over. The <i>Mustichoes</i>
are no small Plagues to those that travel this way, for their Poysonous Stings
are the occasions of many Ulcerated Wounds, and oft-times Death it self.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this way lies also the Countrey <i>del Valle</i>, from which <i>Ferdinand Cortesius</i> receiv’d
the Title of Earl.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>The Mouth of the Haven <i>Acapulco</i> gapes a full League North and South, and
within exceeding large, hath a nook call’d <i>Boca Grande</i>, where the Ships Ride safe
at an Anchor: More Easterly appears a Land Inlet, (by the <i>Spaniards</i> call’d <i>Puerto
del Marques</i>) secur’d against all Winds; near which is the City of <i>San Diego</i>, to
which belongs a Fort, with six Bulwarks, lying on a Promontory; the main of
the City is one large Street, consisting of fair and stately Houses, and leading directly
to the Haven; the Church which is of an oblong square, hath a high Steeple
in the middle.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Spilbergen</i>’s Expedition.</div>

<p class='c010'>A <i>Dutch</i> Admiral, one <i>Joris Spilbergen</i>, after he had done the <i>Spaniards</i> all the mischief
he could along the South Sea, ran with five Sail under the Fort <i>Acapulco</i>,
which fir’d ten Guns at him; whereupon, the <i>Dutch</i> Admiral Manning a Boat,
with a white Flag, they agreed upon a Cessation, and the <i>Spaniards</i> went aboard
of the Admiral, to whom <i>Pedro Alvares</i>, and <i>Francisco Menendus</i>, having been a
considerable time in <i>Holland</i>, and speaking the Language of that Countrey very
perfect, promis’d that all his Demands should be satisfi’d; yet <i>Spilbergen</i> was suspicious
that the <i>Spaniards</i> had a design upon him, wherefore he came and lay close
under the Castle with his five Sail, and made ready his Guns: But this suspicion
was soon clear’d, when <i>Alvares</i> and <i>Menendus</i> proffer’d to stay as Hostages, till the
Governor of the Town sent the Admiral thirty Oxen, fifty Sheep, some hundreds
of Poultry, Coals, Oranges, Cittrons, and the like fresh Provisions; as also Wood
and Water; during which time, the Prisoners being set at liberty, several Persons
of Quality came to visit the Admiral, amongst whom was Captain <i>Castilio</i>, one
that had serv’d twenty years in the <i>Low-Countrey</i> Wars; and <i>Melchior Hernando</i>, Nephew
to the Vice-Roy of <i>New-Spain</i>, who desirous to see the Ships that durst set
twice upon <i>Rodrigo de Mendose</i>, Admiral of the King of <i>Spain</i>’s mighty Fleet, stood
amaz’d that such little Frigats durst Ingage with so many great <i>Spanish</i> Ships; and
carry’d the Admiral’s Son to the Governor of the City, call’d <i>Georgius Perro</i>, who civilly
entertain’d him: Eight days <i>Spilbergen</i> spent here at <i>Acapulco</i>, admiring the
courteous Entertainment of the <i>Spaniards</i>, and the more, because that having News
but eight Moneths before of the <i>Dutch</i> Fleet setting out, they had in that short time
made all things ready for resistance, the Fort having seventeen Brass Guns, and
four hundred Soldiers, besides many Noblemen and Reformades, whereas at other
times there us’d not to be above forty Men, and four Guns in the same.</p>

<h4 id='c261' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. II.</span><br /> Mechoacan.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Bounds and Description of <i>Mechoacan</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The next Province of <i>New Spain</i> is the Bishoprick of <i>Mechoacan</i>, which hath
on the North-East, <i>Panuco</i>; on the East, <i>Mexicana</i>, properly so call’d; on
the South part, <i>Tlascalla</i>; on the West, the Main Ocean, or <i>Mare del Zur</i>;
and last of all, more directly Northward, <i>Xalisco</i>, which is a Province of <i>New Gallicia</i>:
The Name signifieth in the <i>American</i> Language, as much as <i>A Fish Countrey</i>;
and so it is, having many fair Lakes and Rivers in it, abundantly well stor’d with
Fish. The Countrey so exceedingly pleasant and healthful, that ’tis usual for sick
Persons of other Provinces to come hither to recover their health, only by the benefit
of a good Air. The Soil so abundantly fertile of all sorts of Grain, that of
four measures of Seed, it hath been often observ’d, they have reap’d the next Harvest,
more than so many hundred measures of the same Grain. Very well Wooded;
and by reason of its many Rivers and fresh Springs, equally rich in good Pasture:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>and besides great plenty of Medicinal Herbs and Plants, it affordeth good store of
Amber nigh the Sea Coasts, Mulberry-trees, and consequently Silks; much Honey,
Wax, and divers other Commodities, both for necessity and pleasure. The
People of the Countrey are generally tall, of a strong active Body, and a good
Wit, especially in comparison of other Natives; not unskilful in divers curious
Manufactures, the most excellent Feather-Pictures, afore-mention’d, being said to
be found in this Province. They seem more generally inclin’d to the Humors and
Customs of the <i>Spaniards</i>, than any other <i>Americans</i>; and receiv’d the Preaching
of <i>Christian Religion</i>, when time was, with much willingness; so that the Countrey
is now entirely <i>Christian</i>, and divided into several Parishes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Languages belonging to the <i>Mechoacans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Languages which are spoken in <i>Mechoacan</i> are several, as the <i>Otomian</i>, <i>Chihcimian</i>,
and the <i>Mexicans</i>, which is common through all <i>New Spain</i>, and the <i>Tarascan</i>, a
neat and brief Language, which properly belongs to this Countrey.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Tygers.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Lions and Wilde Dogs of this Countrey devour great numbers of Cattel
yearly, yet the greatest mischiefs happen from the Tygers, which often fetch People
out of their Houses, notwithstanding the Doors are lock’d, for they break in
thorow the Walls and Roofs, with much eagerness and strength: Of the greatness
whereof, <i>Jacob Bontius</i> tells us this story, That the Governor <i>Peter Carpentier</i> set
a Trap without the Walls of <i>Batavia</i>, of great Timber, Pleited with Iron, Baiting
it with a Goat; which taking effect, the Tyger that was caught therein, impatient
of such close Imprisonment, rent the Timber, and getting out, left the Goat untouch’d.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Hugo Linschot</i> relates, That the Tygers in the <i>West-Indies</i> hurt no <i>Spaniards</i>, exercising
their cruelty onely on <i>Indians</i>; and that finding a <i>Black</i> and a <i>White</i> Man sleeping
together, they devour the <i>Black</i> and not the <i>White</i>: How far these assertions
deserve to be credited, may appear by an evident contradiction of the first, for it
is well known, many <i>Spaniards</i> in the <i>West-Indies</i> have been eaten by the Tygers.</p>

<p class='c010'>General <i>Fedreman</i> marching in this Countrey at the Head of his Army, was assaulted
by a Tyger, which in despight of them all killing a <i>Spaniard</i>, and three <i>Indians</i>,
escap’d from them; no Trees serve for a refuge against their fury, for they
climb up to the top thereof, and fetch down their Prey; their Claws are so exceeding
Venomous, that whoever is scratch’d with the same, is never to be cur’d; there is no
Beast but they will venture upon, wherefore they lie in the Bushes, from whence
they rush out upon them; but this disadvantage they have, that most other Beasts
are too nimble Footed for them, for they are a very heavy Creature, whatever hath
been deliver’d by the Ancients concerning the Tygers swiftness.</p>

<p class='c010'>As to the difference which they make in Humane Flesh, it is thus far true: That
they find more sweetness in Womens Breasts than other parts, and chose a <i>Black</i>
Man before a <i>White</i>: Concerning the first, <i>France</i> gives a sufficient testimony,
when two Tygers, in the time of King <i>Lewis</i> the Twelfth, breaking loose,
left a great number of Women lying Breastless in the Road. The second is confirm’d
by <i>John Johnston</i>’s Relation of a strange accident that happen’d in <i>Bengale</i>,
<i>viz.</i> A <i>Moor</i> dreaming that a Tyger fetch’d him out of the Ship, hid himself the
next Night between Decks, of which the Master asking the reason, was inform’d
concerning his Dream, which prov’d prophetick, for about Mid-night
a Tyger leapt into the Ship, and devouring the <i>Moor</i>, went away without touching
any one of the <i>Hollanders</i>, of which there were thirty: But a Sea-man walking
on the shore escap’d more wonderfully, for a Tyger setting upon him behind, and
a Crocodile before, he leaping from betwixt them, discover’d to the Tyger the
Crocodile, to whom the Tyger directly running, and ingaging with the Crocodile,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>spar’d the Sea-mans life: Notwithstanding the cruelty and mischief of these Tygers,
the <i>Indians</i> are led by their sottish Superstition to worship them; because, as
they say, the Devil often appears to them in that shape.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Squerrils.</div>

<p class='c010'>Besides the Tygers, the Inhabitants of <i>Mechaocan</i> are exceedingly molested with
Squerrils, which not only carry much Fruit into their Holes, but also under-mine
the Houses, so that they often sink or fall on one side, the mischief being the worse,
because they increase daily. Most of them bear four young at a time, which on the
third day run about for Prey, and can scarce be taken, because of their exceeding
swiftness, leaping a great distance from one Tree to another; their Tails serve
them on divers occasions; for leaping they use it like a Wing, and at their crossing
over a River, for a Sail; in tempestuous Weather, they stop their holes therewith,
to keep out the Wind.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Several kinds of them.</div>

<p class='c010'>There are six several sorts of these Squerrils; the first call’d <i>Tlilic</i>, cover themselves
with their Tails; the second <i>Quapatchli</i>, is as big again, and can never be
made tame; the third <i>Techallotl</i>, with a bald Tail and great Eyes; the fourth <i>Talmototly</i>,
hath a thick Head, and a Tail full of black and white streaks; the fifth <i>Quimitchpatlan</i>,
hath a little Head and long Legs, and leaping from one Tree to another,
seems to flie; the last sort call’d <i>Yztactechalotl</i>, is whitish.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Foxes.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Foxes do also great mischief here, their Urine smells so horribly, that forty
days after, none are able to abide near the place where they have urin’d, and on
whatsoever Stuff or Cloth a drop thereof chanceth to light, the stink can never be
wash’d away.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Bird <i>Auras</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Here breeds also a sort of Birds, call’d <i>Auras</i>, which are not unlike Moore-Hens;
they flie exceeding high in the Air, feed on nought but stinking Carrion,
which they scent at a great distance; they have a hairy Head and Neck, and ugly
Face: Some of the Fowls of this Countrey stay here all the year long, others go
away, and return at certain times.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ingenuity of the Natives.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Natives, since the <i>Spaniards</i> coming thither, have gotten their Habits and
Language, learn’d all sorts of Trades; their Tables, Chests, and Cupboards made
of  <i>Brasile</i>-Wood, are no way inferior to the best that are made in <i>Europe</i>. Painting
is also in great esteem amongst them: They make handsom Clothes, Shooes, and
strange Copper Locks. They have a peculiar Art in Tilling their Ground: They
teach the <i>Spanish</i> Dogs several tricks, but not feeding them well, they cause them
to run from them, and turn wilde, whence they are call’d <i>Cimarrones</i>, because they
do much hurt to the Cattel.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Inhabitants, when a Feaver or Ague is upon them at the highest, leap into
cold Water: against other Sicknesses they use Herbs, whose soveraign Power Experience
hath long since taught them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since the <i>Spaniards</i> made <i>Mechoacan</i> a Bishoprick, they have built ninety four
Schools, fifty Churches, several Hospitals and Cloysters, inhabited by <i>Franciscan</i>
and <i>Augustin</i> Monks.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are said to be in this Bishoprick a hundred and fifty Towns or Burroughs
(besides many scatter’d Villages) most of which have Free-Schools erected in
them, for the Training up of Youth in the <i>Christian</i> Religion, good Literature and
Arts; and few of them without an Hospital for the Sick: of which Towns the
principal are as followeth:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Principal Towns.</div>

<p class='c010'>1. <i>Zinzoutza</i>, the Seat of the ancient Kings of <i>Mechoacan</i>. 2. <i>Pascuar</i>, a City
forty seven Leagues distant from <i>Mexico</i>, once a Bishop’s See. 3. <i>Valladolid</i>, the Metropolis
or chief City of the Province, since the Episcopal Chair was remov’d from
<i>Pascuar</i> thither. It lieth upon a great Lake, equal almost for bigness to that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span><i>Mexico</i>, and is about seven Leagues distant from <i>Pascuar</i>, towards the East. 4. <i>St. Michaels</i>,
a good Town, forty Leagues Westward of <i>Mexico</i>, and in the Way to the
<i>Zacatecas</i>, but lying in a Road that is somewhat dangerous, being not a little infested
with Salvages on both sides of it. 5. <i>St. Philips.</i> 6. <i>La Conception de Salaya</i>,
seventeen Leagues distant from <i>Valladolid</i>, and a convenient Stage for Travellers,
being indeed, with the two last mention’d, built chiefly for the defence and securing
of the Countrey against the Salvages. 7. <i>Guaxanata</i>, a Town on the Borders
of <i>Panuco</i>, where there are very rich Mynes of Silver. 8. <i>Leon</i>, another Town
likewise of very rich Mynes, twenty four Leagues distant from <i>Valladolid</i>, and threescore
from <i>Mexico</i>. 9. <i>Zamorra.</i> 10. <i>Villa de los Lagos</i>, and others.</p>

<p class='c010'>Towards the Sea there is 1. <i>Acatlan</i>, but two Miles distant from the Sea-Coast,
and a small Town, yet by reason of a safe and very good Harbor which it hath for
Shipping, a Place of no little Trading. 2. <i>Natividad</i>, another well known and
convenient Haven upon <i>Mare del Zur</i>, pertaining to this Province, and from whence
they usually set Sail for the <i>Philippine</i> Islands. 3. <i>St. Jago de buena Speranza</i>, so call’d
by the <i>Spaniards</i>, perhaps from the abundance of good Pearls they found upon this
Coast. 4. <i>Colyma.</i> 5. <i>Zacatula</i>, and some others.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Province, as we said, was at first a distinct Kingdom of it self, yet subordinate
and Tributary to that of <i>Mexico</i>; the King whereof nam’d <i>Tamgaiva</i>, or <i>Bimbicha</i>,
(as <i>Laet</i> reporteth) at the first coming of the <i>Spaniards</i> thither, after the Conquest of
<i>Mexico</i>, voluntarily submitted himself to them, and was Baptiz’d. Nevertheless afterwards,
upon a pretence of I know not what Treason intended by him against
them, and which the <i>Spanish</i> Writers themselves professedly think to have been
feigned, by command of <i>Nunnez de Gusman</i>, President of the <i>Chancery</i> of <i>Mexico</i>, he
was most inhumanely burnt alive, and his Kingdom seiz’d upon by the <i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Description of <i>Tlascalla</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The Bishoprick of <i>Tlascalla</i>, formerly call’d <i>Tlascalteca</i>, <i>Tlaxcala</i>, and <i>Tlascalan</i>,
is a Province of <i>New Spain</i>, which extendeth it self entirely from one
Sea to another, <i>viz.</i> from the <i>Atlantick</i> to <i>Mare del Zur</i>, with which it is
bounded on the East and West Parts, lying otherwise, and for the most part betwixt
the Provinces of <i>Mexicana</i>, last spoken of, and that of <i>Guaxata</i>, which followeth,
containing in length from one Sea to the other, not much less than an hundred
Leagues, and in some places fourscore in breadth; but towards the South
Sea growing much narrower. It is a Countrey exceedingly plentiful both in Corn
and Cattel, full of rich Pasturage, and so plentifully stor’d with <i>Maiz</i>, Wheat, and
other Grain, that it is accounted as it were the Granary of <i>America</i>; besides Deer,
all manner of Venison, and great store of Fowl. There is likewise Copperess, Allom,
Silver-Mynes, <i>Manna</i>, <i>Anime</i>, and Liquid Amber, with a sweet smelling Gum
which drops out of a Tree. The Rivers feed no Fish, because they fall with exceeding
force from the Mountains; onely near <i>Topoyanco</i>, is a deep Lake of fresh
Water, inhabited round about by <i>Indians</i>, enjoying the pleasure and profit of the
many <i>Cumbeba</i>-Trees, which yield <i>Cochinele</i>, producing yearly above two hundred
thousand Duckets worth of that Commodity. In this Lake swim black Hedge-hogs,
whose Flesh is good and wholsom to eat.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The ancient State of the <i>Tlascallans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The People of this Countrey, when the <i>Spaniards</i> came first amongst them, liv’d
in the form of a Common-wealth, or Free-State, refusing to be subject to the King of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span><i>Mexico</i>, with whom they had almost continual War; and upon that account, as
hath been said, assisted <i>Cortesius</i> in the Conquest of the Kingdom, without whose help
’tis most certain he had never been able to do any thing. They enjoy therefore many
special Priviledges and Immunities more than other <i>Americans</i> do. They pay
no Tribute, but onely a handful of Wheat yearly for every Person, by way of acknowledgment,
otherwise living, under the Protection of the <i>Spaniards</i>, wholly in
the Form of their ancient Government. In former times they were great Man-eaters,
and not onely eat the Flesh of their Enemies, but also of one another, insomuch
that Man’s-flesh hung in publick to be sold.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>River <i>Zahuatl</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The River <i>Zahuatl</i>, which rushes out of the Mountain <i>Xicoleucalt</i>, oftentimes
overflows all the Countrey near it, and washes away divers Houses. <i>Zahuatl</i> signifies
<i>Scabby Water</i>, because all those, especially Children, that wash in the same, are
sure to be Scabby. On its Banks the <i>Spaniards</i> have built many Houses, the fashion
whereof is now also imitated by the <i>Indians</i> of this Province, who formerly built
quite after another manner; for they made low Houses of Earth, Wood and Stone,
with large and strange Chambers; some a Stones-cast one from another, others
close together, had narrow crooked Streets that ran betwixt them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Tlascallans</i> Language.</div>

<p class='c010'>In this Province are two sorts of Languages spoken, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Mexican</i>, and that
of the <i>Ottomons</i>, who formerly deserting <i>Mexico</i>, chose the <i>Tlascallans</i> for their
Protectors: They are a toilsom and painful People.</p>

<p class='c010'>To the Northward of <i>Tlascalla</i> are Mountains, which all the year long, except
three Moneths, are cover’d with Mist; and the Woods on the tops of them are a
great shelter to Lyons, Tygers, Wolves, and wild Dogs, call’d <i>Adives</i>, and other
wild Beasts, which do much hurt to the small Cattel. Here are also many Serpents
and Adders.</p>

<p class='c010'>The whole Province is said to contain two hundred good Towns and Burroughs,
and more than one thousand Villages, all of them exceedingly populous,
and suppos’d to contain in the whole above a Million and half of Natives, besides
<i>Spaniards</i>, who have some few Colonies in the Countrey for securing of it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and Villages.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chief Towns of the Province are 1. <i>Tlascalla</i> it self, which denominates the
whole Countrey as the Metropolis, and where the Bishop’s See was at first, till in
the Year 1550. it was remov’d to <i>Puebla de los Angelos</i>. It is a fair Town, and commodiously
seated in the midst of a large and fertile Champain of threescore Miles in
compass. It consisteth of four large and beautiful Streets or Quarters, and in the
midst of them where they all meet, hath a <i>Piazza</i>, or Market-place, equal to that
of <i>Mexico</i>, and able to receive twenty or thirty thousand Persons conveniently, to
Buy and Sell in it; and whose Shambles seldom shew less than fifteen thousand
Sheep, four thousand Oxen, and two thousand Hogs.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Puebla de los Angelos</i>, or <i>The City of Angels</i>, a Town built by <i>Sebastian Ramirez</i>,
a Church-man, and he that was the first President, or chief Governor of <i>Mexico</i>, under
the Crown of <i>Castile</i>. It was built in the Year 1531. almost in the Road-way
from <i>Vera Crux</i> to <i>Mexico</i>, and seated in a very delicate and fertile Countrey, and of
a good Air. It is a Bishop’s See, and valu’d at twenty thousand <i>Ducats</i> of yearly
Rent, the City it self suppos’d to contain about fifteen hundred Families; where
there is abundance of excellent Cloth made, and for fineness not yielding to the
best of <i>Spain</i>. Its chief Edifices are, the Cathedral and four stately Cloysters, belonging
to the <i>Dominicans</i>, <i>Franciscans</i>, <i>Augustines</i>, and <i>Capuchins</i>; as also a Free-School
for five hundred <i>Indian</i> Children, endow’d by <i>Ramirez</i> with a yearly Revenue.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>Zempoallan</i>, seated upon a River of the same Name.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>Napalaca</i>, in the Valley <i>Ocumba</i>, ows its original to an <i>Indian</i> call’d <i>Juan</i>, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>at first had onely one House, and a Herd of Hogs there, till upon his invitation,
all the neighboring People came from the tops of the Hills; insomuch, that in a
short time, the place was Peopled by thousands of Families.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <i>Guaxacingo</i>, all hitherto great and ancient Towns of the Natives.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <i>Segura de la Frontera</i>, a <i>Spanish</i> Town, built by <i>Cortez</i> presently upon the Conquest
of <i>Mexico</i>, for the securing of the Confines, as the Name importeth.</p>

<p class='c010'>7. <i>Vera Crux</i>, a Town built by <i>Cortez</i> and his Companions, at their first Landing,
and where afterwards, by a Stratagem, and out of a resolution either to Conquer
or Die in the Countrey, he caus’d all his Ships to be burnt, that his Soldiers
might not so much as think of returning back from whence they came. The
Town was at first built five or six Leagues up within Land; but the place being
found not to be so healthful, the Inhabitants in a short time deserted it, and seated
themselves upon a Bay of the Sea, right over against <i>St. John D’ Ullua</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>8. <i>Medellin</i>, another <i>Spanish</i> Town, built likewise by <i>Cortez</i>, in memory of his
own Birth-place, which was <i>Medellin</i>, a small Town of <i>Estramadura</i>, a Province of
<i>Spain</i>, but was afterwards destroy’d by some <i>Spanish</i> Commanders, out of malice to
<i>Cortez</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, <i>St. John D’ Ullua</i>, a noted, and the most usual Port to all this Province,
and likewise to the City of <i>Mexico</i> it self, from the North Sea: but of difficult entrance,
especially to such as are not well acquainted with the Passage, or want
Guides, by reason of certain Rocks and Quicksands, wherewith the Mouth of the
Haven is said to be bar’d; but within, the station is more safe. It hath likewise two
strong Bulwarks or Forts rais’d, on either side of the Entrance one, to defend the
Passage; besides a strong Castle, built since Captain <i>John Hawkins</i> surpris’d twelve
Ships richly Laden within the Haven, and thirteen others that arriv’d with a new
Vice-Roy from <i>Spain</i>, valu’d at near sixty Tun of Gold, of which he might easily
have made Prize, had he not trusted to the Vice-Roys Promise, to give him all satisfaction
he should require, by which being deceiv’d, he lost all his Fleet but two
Ships.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Great increase of Crocodiles.</div>

<p class='c010'>Between <i>Tlascala</i> and <i>Los Angelos</i> are the Fountains, out of which the River hath
its Original, which gliding by <i>Machaocan</i> and <i>Zacatula</i>, falls into the South Sea:
This River is so exceeding full of Crocodiles, that they have made several places
which formerly were Inhabited on its Banks, utterly desolate; for the Females laying
generally Eggs as big as those of a Goose, increase prodigiously; and were it
not that the <i>Indian</i> Mice, call’d <i>Ichneumones</i>, destroy’d them, they would grow still
to greater numbers: But this Animal creeping in at the Crocodiles Mouth, eats
his way out of the Belly again; Water-Serpents, Hawks, <i>Buffeloes</i>, and especially
Tygers, are also their mortal Enemies, for they throwing the Crocodiles on their
Backs, rend open their Bellies: They are more desirous of Mans flesh here than in
any other place, because the River of <i>Tlascala</i> hath but small store of Fish; in the
day time they lie cover’d in the Mud, from whence they rush forth, and set upon
those that happen to pass by them; they pursue the <i>Canoos</i> in the Water, and strike
down the Rowers with their Tails.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Burning Mountain <i>Popatepeck</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Eight Leagues beyond <i>Tlascala</i>, appears the Mountain <i>Popatepeck</i>, which for ten
years ceas’d smoaking, till <i>Anno 1540.</i> it broke forth in such a manner, that the
Countrey all about was terrifi’d therewith; for it vomited not onely a black
Smoak, but also horrible Flames, which sometimes being blow’d downward,
burnt the Corn in the Fields, and the Ashes thereof flying as far as <i>Guaxocingo</i> and
<i>Chulula</i>, burnt a great deal of the Town to the Ground; every one endeavor’d by
flight to secure themselves, with intention never to return thither again; but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Flame and Smoak abating, Captain <i>Diego de Ordas</i> went up to view the place,
whence the Fire was cast forth; which curiosity and presumption of his, had like
to have cost him his Life, for the sulphury Smoak breaking forth on a sudden, had
almost stifled him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rivers of <i>Mexicana</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, the Bishoprick of <i>Tlascala</i>, is on the North Coast wash’d by the River
<i>Papoloava</i>, since call’d <i>Alvarado</i>, from a <i>Spanish</i> Commander, who first Steer’d his
Course thither: The next Stream nam’d <i>Banderas</i>, is so call’d, because the Natives
held white Clothes on Poles, to invite the <i>Spaniards</i> ashore. The third is <i>Almeria</i>, on
which, <i>Cortesius</i>, a year after the taking of <i>Mexico</i>, built the Town <i>Medellin</i>, as aforemention’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>Along the <i>Tlascallan</i> shore, wash’d by the Northern Ocean, lie the Isles <i>Blanca</i>,
<i>Verde</i>, and <i>Sacrificios</i>: The first receiv’d its denomination from <i>White Land</i>, the other
from <i>Green Trees</i>; and the third, because <i>Joan de Greyalve</i>, who first Discover’d <i>New
Spain</i>, Landing on this Island, found a Bloody Altar there, with Sacrific’d People
with open’d Brests, chopt off Arms and Legs.</p>

<p class='c010'>The River <i>Almeria</i> falling into the Ocean opposite to the <i>Sacrificios</i>, the <i>Spanish</i>
Ships came often to an Anchor there; but in these latter times, they have forsaken
the same, because the Northern Winds us’d to blow very hard against the shore,
and spoil’d many Vessels: But <i>Henry Hawks</i> gives this reason, That a dreadful apparition
of Spirits frighted the <i>Spaniards</i> from thence.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Province <i>Tepeaca</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the Bishoprick <i>Tlascala</i>, is also compriz’d the Province <i>Tepeaca</i>, whose Metropolis
was built by <i>Cortez</i>, when with great Loss he was sent from <i>Almeria</i>. The
Soil thereabouts is barren and stony; the Water which they have in the City, is
brought in Pipes from a River which flows out of the Mountains into the Market
place. The plain Countrey hath many good Pastures. The Inhabitants thereof
speak four sorts of Languages; of which, the commonest is the <i>Mexican</i>; others
use the <i>Popolucan</i> or <i>Otoman</i> Tongues.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Alyoxuan</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Village <i>Alyoxucan</i> appears afar off on a high Mountain, on whose top is a
Lake of a hundred and fifty Fathom in circumference; the Water whereof is very
cold, and of a bluish Colour, and neither Ebbs nor Flows, to which the Villagers
climb along a narrow Path.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not far from thence, in the Plain, are two other very deep Lakes: The first
call’d <i>Tlacae</i>, is a League in circumference, and breeds delicate white Fish, not
above a Fingers length: The second nam’d <i>Alchichican</i>, about the same bigness,
which in stormy Weather is very turbulent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange sort of Bird.</div>

<p class='c010'>Amongst the Fowls of this Countrey, the most noted is a little Summer Bird,
with a long crooked Tail, speckled Feathers; feeds on nothing but Flowers and
the Dew; about Harvest time, when the Rain ceases, it hangs fast with its Bill on
a Tree, and as soon as the first Rain falls, it revives again.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this Countrey <i>Tepeaca</i> are five Villages, in each of which is a <i>Franciscan</i> Cloyster
and convenient Hospital.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this Countrey they gather the Water in the time of the Rainy Moneths, in a
digg’d Pool, which every Morning produces little Toads with long Tails, which
in few days fall off; but these little ones growing to be great, make a most dreadful
noise in the Night: From <i>October</i> till <i>March</i>, not one drop of Rain falls in this
Countrey; during which time, the Northern Winds make a dry and wholsome
Air, yet oftentimes a tempestuous Sea, to the loss of many Ships.</p>

<p class='c010'>Farther up into the Countrey, between <i>Vera Crux</i> and <i>Los Angelos</i>, lies the Village
<i>Rinconanda</i>; and also <i>Xalapa</i> and <i>Perota</i> built of Straw Houses in the middle of
a Wood of Cedar and Pine-Trees, inhabited by the <i>Spaniards</i>, for the accommodating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>of Travellers: To which purpose there are likewise Inns built near the
Spring <i>Fuente de Otzumba</i>, which gushes out of a high Rock.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not far from hence is the Populous Village <i>Chetula</i>, where a small number of
<i>Spaniards</i> dwell amongst thousands of <i>Indians</i>, who chiefly make use of Mules to carry
their Loads.</p>

<h4 id='c268' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. IV.</span><br /> Guaxata.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Description of <i>Guaxata</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Between <i>Los Angelos</i> and <i>Guatemala</i>, lies the Bishoprick of <i>Antiquera</i> or <i>Guaxata</i>
largely taken; it hath on the North, the Bay of <i>Mexico</i>; on the South, <i>Mare
del Zur</i>; on the East, <i>Jucatan</i> and <i>Chiapa</i> which is one of the Provinces of
<i>Guatimala</i>; on the West, <i>Tlascalla</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Division.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey extendeth it self upon the South Sea about an hundred Leagues
in length, but from the Sea to the Borders of <i>Tlascalla</i>, one hundred and twenty;
Eastward not above half so much; having a good Air, and a Soil no less fruitful,
especially in Mulberry-Trees, and abundance of Silks, which the Countrey
affordeth, more than any other Province of <i>America</i> besides; nor is it less rich
in Mines of Gold and Silver, there being scarce a River in the whole Countrey,
but the Sands of it are said to be Tinctur’d more or less with that yellow Metal;
also Crystal and Copperess. It yieldeth likewise great plenty of <i>Cassia</i> and <i>Cochinele</i>,
two rich Commodities; and the People generally, if they would take pains, might
be the wealthiest, ’tis thought, of any other in <i>America</i>: But whether it be through
any voluntary contempt of Riches, or through any natural sloathfulness, as yet
they seem to Pine in the midst of plenty, living, for the most part of them, little
better than from Hand to Mouth; nevertheless, exceeding liberal of what they
have, especially to such as bear the Habit of Religion, and attend the service of
their Souls; maintaining in a plentiful and good manner, as ’tis said, no less than
one hundred and twenty Convents of Religious Men, of several Orders, in this
onely Province; besides Hospitals, Schools for the training up of Youth, and other
places of publick Charity; it is said also to have three hundred and fifty Villages,
and near as many brave Countrey Houses. It is subdivided into many particular
Provinces; which, because they are many and but small, in comparison of
some other, we may call <i>Wapentakes</i>, or Hundreds, rather than Provinces: The
principal whereof are these that follow, <i>viz.</i> 1. <i>Misteca.</i> 2. <i>Tutepecque.</i> 3. <i>Zapoteca.</i>
4. <i>Guazacoalco.</i> 5. <i>Gueztaxatla</i>: and 6. the <i>Valley of Guaxata</i>, from whence <i>Cortez</i>, after
the Conquest of <i>Mexico</i>, had his Title given him by the Emperor, <i>Marquess of
the Valley</i>. It is the richest and most pleasant part of the whole Province, extended
in a continu’d Tract together, full sixteen Leagues or more, lying about fourscore
Southward of <i>Mexico</i>, and wanting neither Mines of Gold and Silver, nor any other
of the prime and best Commodities of the <i>New-World</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Languages.</div>

<p class='c010'>In this Countrey they speak thirteen sorts of Languages, of which the <i>Mexican</i> is
most us’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Poisonous Herb.</div>

<p class='c010'>Amongst the Plants which grow here, is an exceeding Poysonous Herb, which
kills those whosoe’re pluck it, though a long time after, that is to say, if it be of a
Years growth, it kills not before the Years end; if a Moneth old, at the Moneths
end; if a Day, on the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey formerly suffer’d also many inconveniencies by Earthquakes,
but of late they are somewhat abated, which the <i>Spaniards</i> ascribe to <i>Martialis</i>, Protector
of the Cathedral at <i>Antequera</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span><i>Misteca</i> is divided into <i>Alta</i> and <i>Baxa</i>, both of which have Rivers and Brooks
that afford Gold, whither the <i>Indian</i> Women taking Provisions, go for several days,
and gather Gold in Troughs, which they exchange at the <i>Spanish</i> Markets for
Provisions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Cave.</div>

<p class='c010'>Not far from the Village <i>Cuertlavaca</i>, lies a high Mountain, remarkable for a
strange Cave, whose Entrance is very narrow, at the end whereof appears a square
Place of fifty Foot; upon one side whereof stand Pits with Steps; near which begins
a crooked Way of a League long; at the end of which is a spacious Place
with a Fountain of good Water; from the Foot of which flows a small Brook:
But because none have made any farther discovery of this Cave, the other parts of
it remain yet unknown.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the top of <i>St. Antonio</i>, the <i>Indians</i> live with their Families in Caves between
the Rocks.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not far from hence appear two Mountains, whose tops, though they lie at a
great distance from one another, at the bottom they are so near, that a Man may
step from one to the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>The six Rocks <i>Pennoles</i>, formerly Garrison’d by the Kings of <i>Mexico</i>, have Gold,
Lead-Mynes, and a Root which is us’d in stead of Soap.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Village <i>Totomachiapo</i>, is a Cave of half a Mile long, at the end whereof the
Water prevents a farther discovery.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Rocky Countrey <i>Zapotecas</i> formerly bred very salvage Inhabitants, Mantled
in Furrs, but now Civiliz’d, clad after the common manner.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Americans</i>, whether Extracted from the ten Tribes of <i>Israel</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The People spread over <i>Guaxacualco</i>, <i>Yluta</i>, and <i>Cueztxatla</i>, observe Circumcision,
according to an ancient Custom; from whence some have in vain sought for a testimony,
that these <i>Americans</i> should be originally extracted from the scatter’d
Tribes of <i>Israel</i>; but the <i>Tartars</i> more immediately, who at last crossing the <i>Straits</i>
of <i>Anian</i>, furnish’d the desolate Countrey of <i>America</i> with Inhabitants: But this
Opinion is without any probability of truth; for it will never follow from their
Circumcision, that the <i>Tartars</i>, the greatest People on Earth, must owe their original
to a few <i>Israelites</i>, Prisoners, since that Ceremony was never thought on by
them till they embrac’d the <i>Mahumetan</i> Religion. And though they had been Circumcis’d
before <i>Mahomet</i>’s time, this would be no testimony that they were extracted
from the <i>Israelites</i>: for how many People embrac’d Circumcision, which
were never extracted from <i>Abraham</i>’s Seed? It is affirm’d by <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, that
the <i>Cholchians</i>; by <i>Philo Judæus</i>, the <i>Egyptians</i>; by <i>Herodotus</i>, the <i>Moors</i>; by <i>Strabo</i>,
the <i>Troglodytes</i>; by <i>Cyprian</i>, the <i>Phœnicians</i> and <i>Arabians</i> Circumcis’d themselves from
all Antiquity, which is to this day observ’d by some of them. It also plainly appears
by the Prophet <i>Jeremiah</i>, that the <i>Egyptians</i>, <i>Edomites</i>, <i>Ammonites</i>, <i>Moabites</i>, and
<i>Ishmaelites</i>, had the same Custom anciently amongst them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and chief Villages of <i>Guaxaca</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Towns of principal note inhabited by the <i>Spaniards</i> in this Province, are
1. <i>Antequera</i>, in the Valley aforesaid, a stately City, and beautifi’d with a fair Cathedral
Church, built with Pillars of the finest Marble, of great heighth and
bigness. The River which glides by the Walls, springing out of the Ground, runs
to the Mountain <i>Coatlan</i>. Not far from thence lies the Village <i>Herrera</i>, which boasts
four hundred <i>Spanish</i> Families, though some say that the greatest part of them are
<i>Indians</i>, who pay the <i>Spaniards</i> Cotton Cloaks and Nuts for Tribute.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Illephonso de los Zapotecas</i>, lies on a Mountain belonging to the <i>Mixes</i>, anciently
a salvage, strong, and long-bearded People, who speak a gross Language, and in
former times went naked, onely a white Deer-skin, Tann’d in Man’s Brains, about
their Middle. They maintain’d continual War against the <i>Zapoteca</i>’s, and could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>never have been subdu’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>, had it not been for their Dogs, which
kept them in such awe, that thirty <i>Spanish</i> Soldiers ventur’d to live in <i>Illephonso</i>
amongst thirty thousand <i>Mixes</i>, who now drive a Trade in Cotton, <i>Maize</i>, and
Gold.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>San Jago de Nexapa</i> appears at a great distance on a high Mountain, where also
twenty Soldiers with their Dogs were wont to awe the cruel Natives.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. The last Place, built by <i>Gonzales de Sandovall</i>, <i>Anno 1522.</i> is <i>Villa del Espiritu
Santo</i>, Commands fifty <i>Indian</i> Villages, which with great difficulty were brought
to submit to the <i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The River <i>Aquivicolco</i> affords a convenient Harbor, the Mouth thereof being a
hundred and ninety Paces broad.</p>

<p class='c010'>Upon the Southern Ocean is the Haven <i>Guatulco</i>, where the Ships that Sail to

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Bounds and Description of <i>Panuco</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Panuco</i> is the most Northerly Province of <i>New Spain</i>, by some call’d <i>Guasteca</i>,
bounded on the East with the Gulf of <i>Mexico</i>; on the West with <i>Uxitipa</i>, a
Countrey of <i>New Gallicia</i>; on the North with some undiscover’d Countreys
of <i>Florida</i>, from which it is divided by the <i>River of Palms</i>; on the South with <i>Mechoacan</i>
and <i>Mexicana</i>. It is call’d <i>Panuco</i>, from a River of that Name, which turning
from the Mountains <i>Tepecsuan</i> in <i>New Gallicia</i>, and dividing <i>New Biscay</i> from
the Province of <i>Zacatecas</i>, passeth through the midst of this Countrey also, and at
last empties it self into the Gulf.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey is reckon’d to be about fifty Leagues in length, and not much
less in breadth; of a fruitful Soil, having some Mynes of Gold in it, and once very
populous till the <i>Spaniards</i>, about the Year 1522. dispeopled it by their insatiable
cruelty.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Conquest of it difficult.</div>

<p class='c010'>Before <i>Ferdinand Cortesius</i>, <i>Francis de Garay</i> attempted to Conquer this Province,
but after much pains to no purpose, he return’d with but a small remnant of those
he carried with him; and though <i>Cortesius</i> subdu’d the Countreys <i>Ayotetextetlatan</i>
and <i>Chila</i>, yet it was not without many considerable Losses; for the Inhabitants
being valiant and cruel, not fearing the <i>Spanish</i> Bullets, ran in amongst them, and
made great slaughter, and (according to an old Custom in <i>New Spain</i>) drank their
Blood.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Barbarous Customs of the People.</div>

<p class='c010'>These People, on their Festival Days call’d <i>Raeaxipo Veliztli</i>, which signifies <i>A
Flaying of Slaves</i>, us’d to pull off the Skins of a certain number of Slaves, with which
they walkt about begging Alms from Hut to Hut, and whosoever deny’d them,
was sure of a Blow in the Face with the bloody Skin; of which so long as there
was but one Lappet remaining, they went a Begging; and whatsoever they got,
was employ’d in Uses and Necessaries belonging to their Idolatry. On the foremention’d
Days they also us’d other barbarous Customs, amongst which this was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>one: The Priest challenging the Slave which was to be Offer’d, to Fight for his
Life, he had one of his Feet ty’d to a great round Stone, and having a Sword to
offend, and a Shield to defend himself, Encountred with the Priest, who was Arm’d
after the same manner, whom if he conquer’d, he not onely preferv’d his Life, but
gain’d the Name of a valiant Man.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_309.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange usage of Prisoners.</div>

<p class='c010'>They also dealt strangely with Persons that were yearly to be Offer’d to their
Idols: for after having wash’d them, they put on them the Clothes of the Idol, and
gave them the same Name, every one honouring them as a God; were permitted
to walk up and down, but guarded by twelve Men, that they might not
escape; for then the chiefest of the Guard was to supply the others place: Moreover,
they resided in the chiefest Apartments of the Temple, eat of the best,
were serv’d like Princes, and attended through the Towns by Persons of the
greatest Quality, who led them through the Streets; where they no sooner play’d
on a little Pipe, but all People came running to them, fell at their Feet and worship’d
them: In the Night they lock’d them up in a Cage, secur’d with Iron Bars,
and at the appointed time flay’d them alive.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and Villages.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chief Towns now remaining, and inhabited by the <i>Spaniards</i>, are 1. <i>St. Lewis
de Tampice</i>, a Colony of <i>Spaniards</i> situate on the Northern Bank of the River <i>Panuco</i>,
at the very Mouth of it; where it hath a very large Haven, but so barr’d with
Sands, that no Ship of any great Burden can enter or abide in it with safety; and
yet the River otherwise so deep, that Vessels of five hundred Tun, might Sail up
threescore Leagues at least within Land, and thereby visit the rich Mynes of <i>Zatatecas</i>
on the one side of it, and of <i>New Biscay</i> on the other, at pleasure, and without
fear of much opposition.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>St. Stevan del Puerto</i>, on the South side of the same River, eight Leagues distant
from the Sea, or Gulf of <i>Mexico</i>, at present the Metropolis or chief Town of the
Province, built by <i>Cortesius</i> in the place where stood old <i>Panuco</i>, which was likewise
the Metropolis, or Head Town of the Natives, before the <i>Spaniards</i> burnt and destroy’d
it.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>3. <i>St. Jago de las Valles</i>, which is a Fronteer Place, and enjoyeth certain special
Immunities, and some fair Possessions also for defence of the Countrey against the
Salvages. It is twenty five Leagues distant from <i>St. Stevan del Puerto</i>, lying in an
open or Champain Countrey, and is fenc’d about with a Wall of Earth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Miles Philips</i> his Voyage.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Miles Philips</i>, an <i>Englishman</i>, put ashore by Captain <i>John Hawkins</i>, in the Bay of
<i>New Spain</i>, <i>Anno 1568.</i>, suffer’d great hardship before he came to <i>Panuco</i>, from whence
returning, he made mention of a City lying along a River of the same denomination,
(which is there not above two Bowe shoots-broad,) in a pleasant Countrey,
containing two hundred <i>Spanish</i> Families, beside the antient Inhabitants and <i>Negro</i>’s,
which all drive a great Trade in Salt, which is made in Pans Westward from the
River: <i>Philips</i> travelling from <i>Panuco</i> to <i>Mexico</i>, saw by the way the Villages <i>Nohete</i>,
by the <i>Spaniards</i> call’d <i>Santa Maria</i>, and a Cloyster of white <i>Monks</i>: Next he
view’d <i>Mestitlan</i>, where some grey <i>Monks</i> had a House, and the Town <i>Puchuen</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Chilton</i>’s Journal.</div>

<p class='c010'>Another account of this Province is taken from a Journal kept by <i>John Chilton</i>,
four years after <i>Philips</i>’s Voyage; he having a <i>Spaniard</i> for his Convoy, left <i>Mexico</i> to
find out <i>Panuco</i>; in three days time they reach’d the City <i>Mestitlan</i>, where he observ’d,
that twelve <i>Spanish</i> Families liv’d amongst thirty thousand <i>Indians</i>. The City
built on a high Mountain, full of Woods, is surrounded with Villages, through
which run many brave Springs; and the Air about them is no less wholsom than
the Ground fruitful; the High-ways are shaded with all sorts of Fruit-Trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Village <i>Clanchinoltepec</i>, four times more Populous than <i>Mestitlan</i>, belongs to
a <i>Spanish</i> Nobleman, who built a Cloyster there for nine <i>Augustin</i> Monks, of which
Order there also reside twelve in the City <i>Guaxutla</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, they travel’d over the plain Countrey <i>Guastecan</i>, to the Village <i>Tancuylabo</i>,
inhabited by a tall People, with blue Painted Bodies, and Pleited Hair,
hanging down to their Knees, going stark naked, but never without a Bowe and
Arrow. They esteem nothing more than Salt, as being the onely Cure against
certain Worms that grow between their Lips. From hence they travel’d to <i>Tampice</i>,
in which Journey they spent nine days; and coming thither, were inform’d,
that of forty <i>Christians</i> which dwelt in the same, the <i>Indians</i> had slain twelve, whilst
they were gathering of Salt. From hence they came to <i>Panuco</i>, then in a manner deserted,
because of the <i>Indians</i> oppressing the <i>Spaniards</i>, of which, at that time, there
were but ten, and one Priest. <i>Chilton</i> falling sick here, resolv’d nevertheless to
change that unwholsom Air and barren place for a better; to which purpose, getting
a Horse, he took an <i>Indian</i> behind him for his Guide, but loosing his way in a
thick Wood, happen’d amongst a Company of wild People, which dwelt in Straw
Huts, twenty of them immediately surrounding him, brought him some clear
sweet Water to drink, out of a Gilt <i>Venice</i> Glass, which having drunk, two naked
Men led him into the high-way; which ended at the Gate of the Wall’d City <i>Santo
Jago de las Valles</i>, inhabited by twenty five <i>Spanish</i> Families, who inform’d <i>Chilton</i> of
the great danger which he had been in, for the People which gave him the Water
were Man-eaters, who not long since, had burnt an <i>Augustine</i> Cloyster, built on a
Mountain, had taken away, and eat the People, of which they had in all likelyhood
gotten the <i>Venice</i> Glass; and had they not observ’d <i>Chilton</i> to be sickly, he had without
doubt been eaten by them, and his Skin, with some of his Hair, (that being a
great Ornament amongst them) been hung about their middle.</p>

<p class='c010'>During <i>Chilton</i>’s stay in <i>St. Jago</i>, <i>Frans de Page</i> came thither with forty Soldiers
from the Vice-Roy <i>Henry Manriques</i>, and took five hundred <i>Indians</i>, good Bowe Men
out of the Neighboring Villages, <i>Tanehipa</i> and <i>Tameclipa</i>, with which he design’d to
go to the Silver Mines at <i>Zacatecas</i>: <i>Chilton</i> joyning with this Company, came to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>great River <i>De las Palmas</i>, which separates <i>New Spain</i> from <i>Florida</i>, where they spent
three days in vain, seeking to find a passage over; wherefore they at last took pieces
of Timber, which joyning together, and standing upon, they were Tow’d over
by Swimming <i>Indians</i>; being gotten on the other side, they March’d over steep
Mountains, and thick Wildernesses, and came at last to <i>Zacatecas</i>, on whose Silver
Mines, the richest in all <i>America</i>, work’d above three hundred <i>Spaniards</i> daily.</p>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Bounds and Description of <i>Tabasco</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The last Countrey belonging to <i>New Spain</i> is <i>Tabasco</i>, bounded on the North
by the Northern Ocean, and on the East with <i>Jucatan</i>; and however
some account it a distinct Province, yet others make no mention of it, letting
it pass for that part of <i>Jucatan</i> which lies about the City <i>Tabasco</i>, from which
it seems to be denominated: The Ground level and without Mountains, hath
many great Woods of Cedar-Trees, <i>Brasile</i>, and others. Here are also many good
<i>Indian</i> Fruits, as the <i>Manmeyes</i>, <i>Zapotes</i>, <i>Aguacates</i>, and <i>Guajabos</i>. For three Moneths
they have continually dry Weather, the rest of the year being for the most part
rainy; which vicissitude of Moisture and Heat makes the Countrey exceeding
fruitful, insomuch that they have three or four Harvests of <i>Maiz</i> in a year.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vines, Figs, Lemmons, Oranges, Rice, Barley, and all sorts of Garden-Herbs
grow here also in great plenty.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Pools, Brooks and Lakes, abound likewise with all manner of Fish: and
for Sea-Fish, besides the <i>Tortugas</i>, and <i>Yguanras</i>, the <i>Manate</i>, or <i>Sea-Cow</i>, is of principal
note.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fish <i>Manate</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Fish is terrible to behold, having a Head like an Ox, little Eyes, two
Feet near the Head in stead of Fins, two round Holes in stead of Ears, round
bones like Balls in its Brains, a short Tail, and bristly Skin: The Females have
two Dugs, with which they suckle their Young.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Birds.</div>

<p class='c010'>Peacocks, Pheasants, Parrots, Quales, Hens, Pigeons, with several sorts of Birds
altogether unknown to the <i>Europeans</i>, are here in great abundance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Beasts.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Woods also abound with Tygers and Lyons, which do no little hurt to the
Inhabitants, Wild Hogs, Deer, and Rabbets, are likewise here in great plenty;
and Turtles of an exceeding bigness: Likewise Apes, Polecats, and Squerrils,
which do very much hurt to the Fruit-Trees, especially the <i>Cacao</i>. The <i>Musticho</i>’s
are a great annoyance to the People, and disturb their rest at Night.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Languages of the Natives.</div>

<p class='c010'>Since the <i>Spaniards</i> have conquer’d <i>Tabasco</i>, they have forc’d the Inhabitants to
observe their Laws and Customs. They speak three sorts of Languages, amongst
which that most us’d, call’d <i>Chontal</i>, is copious of Words. The second, <i>Zoques</i>, is
spoken on the Mountains which divide <i>Chiapa</i> and <i>Tabasco</i>. The <i>Mexican</i> Tongue
was first brought thither by the Garrisons which <i>Muteczuma</i> plac’d there in the
Forts <i>Zimatlan</i> and <i>Xicalango</i>, and is the most spoken, in regard it hath not onely its
Accents, but is also of great use, partly because it is understood in most places of
<i>America</i>, and partly because the Priests have made Songs in that Tongue, with
which the <i>Tabascans</i> are much delighted.</p>

<p class='c010'>The chief City <i>Nostra Sennora de la Vittoria</i>, already mention’d in <i>Jucatan</i>, was so
call’d by <i>Ferdinand Cortesius</i>, from the great Victory which he obtain’d over the
Indians when he march’d first towards <i>Mexico</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus far of the Description of the several Parts and Divisions of <i>New Spain</i>, differing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>in Customs and Languages, though most of them have some affinity with
the <i>Mexicans</i>, who by force of Arms had made a way to the supream Empire. All
of them acknowledge a Creator, but have no Name to express the Word <i>God</i>. But
besides the Creator of the World they have made to themselves Gods of many other
Creatures; amongst which are the Sun, Moon, Stars, and the Manes of the Deceased,
the care of whose Burial they committed to the Priests, which was sometimes
in the Fields, sometimes in their Houses; others carried their dead Bodies
to the Mountains, some buried them in Temples; and as they either burnt or buried
the Body, so they buried or burnt their Clothes and Riches with them, especially
of Persons of Quality, whilst those that accompanied the Corps sung a
mournful Song; after which they Feasted. The Heirs of Noble-men that had been at
the Funeral put themselves all into Mourning. A Person, after he is dead, is stretch’d
out upon the Floor, where he lies till all his Friends come to Present and Complement
him, as if living: But at the death of an eminent Person they not onely
bring him Presents, but proffer him his Slaves, Steward, Butlers, Dwarfs, and
Houshold Priest, (all which a Lord must keep) that they may serve him in the other
World. The Priests which perform’d the Funeral Ceremonies, walk’d before the
Corps with the Image of the Idol which the Deceased had appropriated to himself,
(for every Lord, according to the greatness of his Quality, bore the Name
and Apparel of some Idol or another;) other Priests beat on Drums, play’d on Pipes
and singing Dirges, perfum’d the Way with Myrrh, whilest the Servants and Relations
made a doleful cry; a Herauld also carried the Coat of Arms and Trophies
of the Deceased, artificially painted on Cloth; at last they pyl’d sweet Wood
about the Corps, which being lighted, and the Body burnt to Ashes, a Priest in a
frightful Dress, Vizarded with a gaping Mouth, long Teeth, and fiery Eyes, came
on a sudden, and with a long Stick stirr’d the Ashes about, and gathering it in an
Urn, buried the same with the fore-mention’d things.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The Idols in <i>New Spain</i> are represented in terrible Figures, to which they Offer
humane Sacrifices.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>The Priests, divided into higher or lower Orders, acknowledge a supream
Head, which they call <i>Papas</i>. Each Idol had a peculiar sort of Priests: Those that
serv’d <i>Viztlipuzli</i>, obtain’d their Places by Inheritance; but others were chose by
the Commonalty, unless they had been bred Priests from their Infancy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cloysters dedicated to the ancient <i>Mexican</i> Religion.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Mexican</i> Cloysters in the time of <i>Heathenism</i> were generally built in the
chiefest Temples, in a great <i>Piazza</i>, or square Court, where for the most part
two Monastical Houses stood one against another, the one inhabited by a Fraternity
of Recluses, and the other by a Sisterhood; which last being Maids of
twelve or thirteen years of age, call’d <i>The Penitential Daughters</i>, swept the Temple,
prepar’d Meat for the Idols and Priests, which was plentifully supply’d from the
Alms and Offerings that were daily brought in to the Priests, consisting of little
Cakes made like Hands and Feet, besides other strange Meats, which being set before
the Idols, was soon after taken away again, and eaten up by the Priests: They
were under a Governess, who employ’d them in making Embroideries to adorn
the Temple; and sometimes rose up with the Priests at Mid-night, and play’d on
Pipes, perfum’d the Temple, and scourg’d themselves till the Blood ran down
their Backs, besmearing their Faces therewith, and leaving it on a whole year;
then going into a large Chamber, where a Cistern stood for that purpose, they
wash’d it off again; after which, if they committed the least uncleanness, they were
put to a most miserable Death; which was judg’d upon seeing a Rat run through
the Nuns Chamber, or a Batt flying by it, or finding any piece of Cloth gnaw’n
by a Mouse or Rat; for they suppose that the fore-mention’d Creatures dare not
come into a hallow’d place, unless defil’d. In this recluse manner they were onely
confin’d to live a year, which being expir’d, they had free leave to Marry.</p>

<p class='c010'>The House opposite to the Nuns in the same square place of the Temple, was
inhabited by Youths of eighteen and twenty years of age, whose Heads were
shaven like Monks, and pleited Tufts hung from the Crown down to their
Backs; they liv’d also mean and chaste, kept the Priests Clothes and Perfuming-Vessels,
carried Wood for Offerings, and kept always burning Lamps before <i>Viztlipuztli</i>’s
Altar. Amongst them were also Boys of a less Age, whose Office was to
gather Flowers and Herbs to strow the Temple with, to sharpen the Priests Lances,
which they Let themselves Blood with every Night in the Legs, and carry
them Water. These Youths, Cloth’d in Nets, fell on their Faces on the Ground
when they met with a Woman, and went four and four, or six and six together to
beg Alms, and by turns watch’d the fore-mention’d Fire; in the Morning they
drew Blood out of their Thighs, with which they anointed their Temples down
to their Ears, and when the Blood look’d black, wash’d it off again in a consecrated
Bath, which their strict and severe Life endur’d a whole Year.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Mexican</i> Religion abhorr’d by the neighboring People.</div>

<p class='c010'>The particular Religion of the <i>Mexicans</i>, compos’d of cruel slaughters and
butcheries of Men, reign’d a long time against the minds of the other <i>Indians</i> that
were under their Dominion, every one beginning more to abhor the cruel flaying
of living People, and tearing out the Hearts of Men for Offerings; and the rather,
because they were forc’d to fetch them out of their Enemies Countrey with the hazard
of their own Lives, insomuch that they were ready long before to have embrac’d
another Doctrine, if any other Teacher had but appear’d amongst them;
which was the chief reason why they so easily receiv’d the <i>Roman</i> Religion: for
when <i>Cortesius</i> had conquer’d the City <i>Mexico</i>, the <i>Mechoacan</i> Agents entreated him
to send them Teachers to prescribe them Laws, according to which they might
live, because their Idolatry, which had long oppress’d them, was not to be suffer’d
any longer, because of the Cruelties which were requir’d of them in the performance
thereof.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Processions.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>Their Processions were stately, and after this manner: The chiefest Nuns raising
a Paste of <i>Bledoi</i>-Seed and parched <i>Maiz</i>, kneaded it with Honey, of which they
made an Idol resembling their Deity <i>Viztipuztli</i>, across whose Nose and Forehead
they drew a blue Stroke; his Head they adorn’d with a Plume of Feathers, and
in the left Hand plac’d a round Box, in the right a crooked Staff like a Serpent, and
Wings behind on his Shoulders; at the appointed Feast-day the Nuns meet before
Sun-rising, in new white Apparel, with Garlands of <i>Maiz</i> about their Heads
and Necks, which hung down below the left Shoulder, their Faces painted
with several colours, about their Arms hung Parrots Feathers from their Elbows
down to their Hands: Thus adorn’d, they carried the kneaded Idol to a Court,
where the Youths that inhabited a Cloyster in the same Temple, fetching the Idols
blue Throne, with great Reverence set it down at the lower Step of the Temple,
at which the People threw Dust on their Heads; which was no sooner done, but
the Boys ran with all speed to the Mountain <i>Chapultepec</i>, a League from <i>Mexico</i>,
whither the Multitude following them in manner of Procession, made all short
Prayers and Offerings there; from thence hastening into the Champain Fields <i>Atlacuavaya</i>,
they perform’d the like Service as before; which done, they went to the
Village <i>Cuyoacan</i>, a League farther; from whence they came back in all haste with
their Idol into <i>Mexico</i>: Wherefore this Processioning for its expedition was call’d
<i>Ipaina Viztliputli</i>. The Idol being brought into the Temple, was by four Cords
made fast to his Throne, hoised up to the Cieling with the noise of Drums and
Trumpets, whilst the fore-mention’d Youths strow’d the Temple both within
and without full of Roses; after which the Nuns gave the Boys the resemblances
of Bones made of the same Dough with the Idol, with which they were to cover
the Floor of the Chappel; then appear’d the Temple-Priests, with Scarfs about
their Bodies, Garlands on their Heads, and Strings with Flowers about their Necks,
each going in order according to his quality to the place where the Bones lay;
which being Consecrated with Songs and Dances, were religiously worshipp’d for
Bones of the Idol; after which six of the Priests went down to the Stone <i>Quauxicalli</i>,
on which the Prisoners lying upon their Backs, had their Hearts pull’d out;
which being finish’d, the Maids and Boys before-mention’d went to meet one another,
Dancing to the sound of Pipes, Drums and Songs; which their nearest Relations
answering, Danc’d round about them, whither the whole City and Countrey
People all about came flocking in great numbers.</p>

<p class='c010'>During this high Feast none, upon great Penalties, durst eat any other Food
but the Cakes made of the same Dough of which the Idol was made; neither were
they permitted, though Children, to drink till the Afternoon.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, the Priest climb’d up to a Chappel strow’d with Roses, in which the
Idol sitting, they disrob’d him, broke his holy Arms and Legs into little pieces,
which they distributed amongst the common People, who receiv’d them with
great Reverence, and with tears in their Eyes, imagining they eat the Body of their
God; for which honour every one paid a tenth part of the Charge which had
been spent in this high Feast. Then a Priest admonish’d them how they should
lead their Lives, since they were united with their God; which ended, they all
went to their several Habitations in a wonderful good order from the Temple.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ancient Attire of the <i>Mexicans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Concerning the <i>Mexicans</i> Apparel, it is a sufficient testimony, that they are no
way of the same original with the several barbarous Nations, that run up and
down naked in <i>New Spain</i>: for the Inhabitants of <i>Mexico</i> went antiently Cloth’d in
Cotton: On their Heads they wore a high Plume of red Feathers; about their
Necks, over their Shoulders, Breast and Back, a kind of large <i>Thorax</i> of Feathers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>curiously pleited; each Arm adorn’d with Armlets, and their Middles girt with
broad white Girdles full of red Streaks; in stead of Garters they wore Laces of
Feathers, as also a little above their Ancles. Their Priests besmear’d all their
Bodies, especially the Head, with an Ointment, whose special vertue was to make
their Hair grow exceeding long, which they braided with broad Cotton Strings;
they also smutch’d themselves with a kind of blacking Stuff; when they went to
make Offerings to their Idol in Caves, Woods, or on high Mountains, they bedawb’d
themselves with an Ointment made of Spiders, Salamanders, Adders,
Scorpions and Toads, which the Temple-Boys caught for them in great abundance.
This Ointment they made with many Circumstances; for having roasted
the fore-mention’d Vermine on the Hearth of the perpetual Fire before <i>Viztlipuztli</i>’s
Altar, and stamp’d the same in a Mortar with Tobacco, living Scorpions, the Seed
<i>Ololuchqui</i>, (to which they ascrib’d a power of representing Visions) hairy Worms,
and Soot, they kneaded all together, put the Ointment in Pots, and plac’d it before
the Idol, thenceforth reputing it a sanctifi’d Medicine, that would prove good
against all manner of Diseases; wherefore the Priests being always sent for to the
Sick in stead of Doctors, perfum’d the Patient, shav’d his Hair, hung Snakes Bones
about his Neck, and order’d him at a certain Hour to bathe himself, and in the
Night to watch before a Fire-hearth, and to eat no Bread but what had been
Offer’d to their Idol. Moreover, the said Ointment is thought to have another
power, <i>viz.</i> to make those that anointed themselves with the same, valiant and
strong; which the common People believ’d, because the Priests would go through
Woods and Wildernesses that abounded with ravenous Beasts.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_315.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>These <i>Heathens</i> also seem’d to have something of Circumcision and Baptism; for
they not onely cut off a piece of the Infant’s Ears and privy Members, which they
Offer’d to their Idols, but also wash’d them as soon as they came into the World,
putting into their Hands such Tools as were of use in their Fathers Profession.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Nuptial Solemnities.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Marriages also were celebrated with great solemnity: The Priest having
ask’d the Bride and Bridegroom, If they would joyn together in Matrimony? if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>they both consented, he ty’d the Brides Scarf, and Bridegrooms Coat together, and
so accompanying them home, led them nine times about the Fire-hearth: If the
Bride had no Impediments, then the Bridegroom made Presents to her Father and
Mother, Offerings to the Gods, and a brave Dinner to the nearest Relations; after
which an Inventory was drawn of what each of them had brought, that upon
their being Divorc’d, (which was very common amongst the <i>Mexicans</i>) each might
have his share; and if they had Children, the Man was to keep the Sons, and the
Woman the Daughters; nor were they permitted, on pain of death, being once parted,
to joyn together again.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Feast <i>Texcoalt</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>On the ninteenth of May they kept the Feast <i>Texcoalt</i>, Consecrated to the Idol
<i>Tezcatlipuca</i>, before whom they Offer’d a Slave, which was done after this manner:
Towards the Evening the Multitude coming into the Temple, the Priests pulling
off the Idols old, put on new Apparel, hung him full of Precious Stones and Armlets,
set Plumes of Feathers on his Head; which done, the Curtains behind which
he stood, were drawn, and a Priest Cloth’d exactly like the Idol coming forth,
turn’d himself round, blow’d a kind of Trumpet towards the four Winds, and ate
Earth, which all the People imitated: whereof those which had committed any
hainous Offence, Offer’d Incense to the Idol, and weeping, begg’d forgiveness of
their Sins. Those that were Soldiers besought him to grant them store of Prisoners,
and strength to conquer their Enemies; for which they would return him thanks
with Offer’d Prisoners.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Feast of <i>Texcoalt</i> lasting ten days, ended on the twenty ninth of <i>May</i> with
peculiar Ceremonies; for in the Morning a company of Priests, black all over,
carried on their Shoulders a large Chair of State richly adorn’d; in which sat their
Idol <i>Tezcatlipuca</i>, and Priests with long pleited Hair, and Clad in the same Apparel
with the Idol, which they set down at the Foot of a pair of Stairs which led up
to a Chappel; whither the attendant Youths and Virgins came and spread Carpets
before it, and green Boughs of <i>Manghey</i>; after which two Priests carried the
Idol into a spacious Court in the Temple, several others walking before, each with
a perfuming Vessel; when they threw their Perfumes on the Consecrated Hearth,
they held their Hands towards the Idol, desiring him that he would send their
Prayers to Heaven: Next follow’d the Multitude, who scourg’d themselves till
the Blood ran down from their Backs. So soon as the Procession was ended,
the represented <i>Tezcatlipuca</i> was hoised up to the Cieling, and abundance of Flowers
strow’d before the Altar; which done, every one went home to Dinner, whilst
the Youths and Virgins adorn’d the Idol, and plac’d Meat before him: Lastly,
the Votaresses came two and two with Baskets of Bread, and Dishes of Meat:
their Governess in a white Sur-Coat over a red Vest, with Wings on her Shoulders,
and broad Girts, at which hung <i>Calabashes</i> fill’d with holy Reliques and
Flowers: Moreover, she conducted the Votaresses to the Steps of the Altar on
which the Idol sat; where having eaten Bread they came back, and the Temple-Servants
went in their places, and carried the Meat which stood on the Altar to the
Priests Cells, who by that time were to have Fasted five days: this done, the People
came all to the Temple again, to be present at the end of the Feast: then a
Slave, who had represented the Idol a whole year, appear’d, to whom everyone
having shew’d Reverence, the chief Priest cutting open his Breast, tore the Slave’s
Heart reaking out of his Body, and shew’d it to the Sun; then the Consecrated
Youths and Maids made a great noise with Drumming, Singing and Dancing about
the Body till Sun-set; after which the Virgins going up to the upper Chappel,
plac’d Bread and Fruit, made up like dead Mens Bones and Heads, before the Idol,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>where, after it had stood a little while, the Servants went up and fetch’d it down,
whilst the Youths and Maids went to their several Cloysters.</p>

<p class='c010'>Much after the same manner, and with such like brutish Ceremonies, not worth
mentioning, was also celebrated the Feast of <i>Quetzatcoalt</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the inner part of the Temple stood a Stage, on which upon Festival Days the
People Acted Drolls; in which they sometimes feign’d themselves deaf, blind,
lame, and the like, and begg’d to be cur’d of their Idols; sometimes were dress’d
like Serpents, Adders, Crocodiles, or other ravenous Beasts, in which postures
they fought one with another.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Computation of Time amongst the <i>Mexicans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Those Feasts were all kept on certain times, according to the Mexican Almanack,
in which the Year was divided into eight Moneths, and each Moneth into
forty five Days, which together made three hundred and sixty: The five remaining
Days, to compleat the Year, they kept apart, on which all Affairs whatsoever were
laid aside, as Selling, Buying, Offerings, <i>&amp;c.</i> nothing else being thought on but
Feasting one another for the passing away of the time. The first Day of their Year
was on the twenty sixth of <i>February</i>. Each Moneth had a peculiar Name and Sign.
Moreover, they divided the Year into four parts by as many Representations, <i>viz.</i> a
House, a Rabbet, a Cane, and a Flint to strike Fire with; and Figur’d it out by
a Wheel with four Spikes jutting out round about it, colour’d green, red, blue, and
yellow, and in the middle thereof a Sun; each Spike signifi’d thirteen years,
wherefore it had thirteen Divisions, distinguish’d by the four fore-mention’d Representations:
At each Division of the Wheel they set down what remarkable
things should happen that year by certain Characters; as, a Man in red Apparel
typifi’d that Year when <i>Ferdinand Cortesius</i>, clad in Red, conquer’d <i>Mexico</i>. When
the Wheel was fill’d with fifty two years Prognostication, then on the last Night
they broke all their Pots and Vessels in pieces, and blew out their Candles, because
they believ’d, that at the end of the said fifty two years the World would be at an
end, and therefore they had no need of Housholdstuff, or ought else: But so soon as
the Day appear’d again, they play’d on Pipes, Trumpets, and Drums, rejoycing that
God had deferr’d the destruction of the World fifty two years longer; then they
bought new Utensils and Candles, and made solemn Processions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Art of Writing.</div>

<p class='c010'>Concerning the Art of Writing amongst the Inhabitants of <i>New Spain</i>, <i>Joseph
Acosta</i> tells us, That some old Books, containing ancient Passages, the Course of the
Heavens, nature of Beasts and Plants, were found in <i>Jucatan</i>, according to the Relation
of a Learned <i>Indian</i>, but were all burnt by Command of a <i>Spanish</i> Bishop, because
he suppos’d them to be full of Matter touching the Black Art. Their Histories
they describ’d with the Representations of the Things. Rhetorick and Poetry
the Children were taught by Rote in the Schools, so that they never forgot what
they had once learnt; But at present they use <i>Spanish</i>  Letters or Characters.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ancient Government.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, the Government of <i>Mexico</i> hath ever been kept in a good Order, the
King’s Power being exactly limited, that nothing might be lost of the common
Priviledges. The fourth King <i>Icoath</i> made Earls, who next to the Lords of <i>Tezcuco</i>
and <i>Tacuba</i>, had right to the Crown; which was like a Mitre turn’d up behind, and
rising before with a Point. According as they increas’d in Power, so they advanc’d
in Royal Dignity; in which <i>Muteczuma</i> the Second exceeded all others: And to
manifest his splendor, his House for all sorts of Creatures, and many other things,
might serve for a sufficient testimony: for in it he kept Sea-Fish in salt Water,
River-Fish in fresh Water, and all manner of Beasts in peculiar places: The Birds
were kept in great Aviaries, surrounded with golden Rails. Next to the Kings follow’d
four Earls call’d <i>Atlacohecalcatl</i>, which signifies <i>Princes of the Throne Launces</i>, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>Weapon much us’d amongst the <i>Mexicans</i>. The next in Degree were the <i>Tlacatecatl</i>,
or <i>Man-cleavers</i>; <i>Esauahuacatl</i>, or <i>Blood-shedders</i>; <i>Tsallancalqui</i>, or <i>Lords of Blackness</i>,
without all which the King durst not take any Business in hand. High and
lesser Courts of Judicatory, where Matters of Life and Death were try’d, were in
most Cities; and other Courts also for petty Quarrels, Controversies, and the
like. The Collectors brought their Revenues to the Court every Moneth. The
chief thing which preferr’d both Rich and Poor to Places of Honor, consisted in
Valour and heroick Exploits. Their Arms were chiefly sharp pieces of Flint made
fast to a Stick, with which they could at one Blow chop off a Horses Head. They
also us’d Pikes, Clubs, and Lances, and sometimes Slings: For defensive Armour,
they had Helmets and Shields, made of Tygers, Leopards, and Lyons Skins. They
always fell upon their Enemies unawares, their Design being generally to take
Prisoners rather than to kill them; for they reserv’d them for Offerings to their
Idols. <i>Muteczuma</i> made several Commanders over his Armies, giving them a
Power one above the other, which were to be distinguish’d by several Marks; for
the chiefest ty’d the Hair on the top of their Heads with a red String, betwixt
which stuck a brave Plume of Feathers; at the end whereof hung as many Tassels
as they had done noble Exploits. To this Order belong’d also the King, who wore
one of the same Marks, with which King <i>Muteczuma</i> and his Son stand Carv’d on a
Rock. The <i>Ayulas</i>, or <i>The Order of the Eagle</i>, consisted of valiant Men. The <i>Grey
Knights</i> were of less Quality, and wore Collars which reach’d up to their Ears,
the lower part of their Body being naked. Persons of greater Dignity, when going
to the War, were Arm’d from Head to Foot: Which Order was also permitted to
wear Cotton-Clothes, and Shoes richly embroider’d with Gold and Silver; they
us’d painted Vessels, and had Lodgings provided for them at Court.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Education of Youth.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, it is worthy of observation, what great care the <i>Mexicans</i> took in the
bringing up of their Children; to which purpose they had Schools near to their
Temples, in which Youth was taught to Sing, Dance, Morality, Obedience, and
also Martial Discipline. Children of noble Extract had Learned Men for their
Tutors. Their Punishments for Transgressions were very severe, the Masters forcing
their Scholars to Fast and Watch, carry great Burthens of Provisions to the
Army, and be in the midst of Engagements. Others, whose Fancy led them to a
holy Life, willingly embrac’d the Services of the Temple.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their manner of Dancing.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their manner of Dancing in <i>New Spain</i> was very strange and differing; they us’d
pretty Instruments, and Songs which contain’d antique Passages, according to the
Times; they in their Motions imitated Shepherds, Fisher-men, Plowmen, Hunters,
and the like: Sometimes they Danc’d in <i>Mascarades</i>, with a Man on their
Shoulders, making the same Motion with his Hands in the Air, as the other with
his Feet on the Ground. They had also Tumblers and Dancers on the Ropes,
which shew’d strange Tricks on an erected Pole. But above all Dances, the <i>Mitotes</i>
was the chief, which was generally Danc’d in the King’s Palace, or inner Court of
the Temple; in the middle of which they plac’d a great Drum and a hollow Tub
on a large Image; round about which the most eminent Persons made a Ring, Sang
sweetly, and Danc’d leisurely, when on a sudden two that are more nimble,
with divers Motions came into the midst of them, and Danc’d exactly after the
sound of the Drum and hollow Tub, which was seconded with the noise of Flutes
and Pipes.</p>

<h3 id='c281' class='c001'>CHAP. VI.<br /> New Gallicia.</h3>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Bounds and Extent of <i>New Gallicia</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>New Gallicia</i>, by some call’d <i>Guadalajara</i>, from the chief City. This whole
Province is the most Northern Countrey of all <i>America</i>, that is inhabited
to any purpose by the <i>Spaniards</i>. Here, ’tis true, they are scatter’d up and
down in all the parts of it, but it is at a huge distance, and for the most part onely
where the Mines are. It is bounded on the East and to the South, with the Kingdom
of <i>Mexico</i> or <i>New Spain</i>; on the West, with the Gulf or Bay of <i>California</i>;
Northward, for so much as is yet discover’d, with <i>Quivira</i> and <i>Cibola</i>, lying between
eighteen and twenty eight Degrees of Northern Latitude, that is, from <i>La Natividad</i>,
a Port so nam’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>, in the Confines of <i>New Spain</i>, to the most
Northerly Borders of <i>Cinoloa</i>, a part of this Province, containing, as is suppos’d,
not much less than three hundred Leagues in length, and in breadth much more;
and whereof not a tenth part is either us’d or frequented by the <i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Temperature and Nature of the Countrey.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Air is generally here very temperate, inclining rather to Heat than Cold,
and subject now and then to sudden Storms of Rain, and great Claps of Thunder,
which yet do not hinder, but that the Countrey is held to be reasonably healthful,
and the People observ’d to live generally to a good old Age. The Soil, by reason
of the Climate, would be a little inclining to Drought, but that, besides the frequent
Rains which it hath, it is constantly moistned with fresh Morning Dews,
which make it for the most part wonderfully fruitful, almost beyond belief, yielding
for every Bushel of Wheat that is sown, threescore; and of <i>Maiz</i>, two hundred
for one; besides great plenty of Sugar-Canes and Cochinele; both which nevertheless
the <i>Spaniards</i> are said to neglect in some sort, employing themselves wholly
about richer Commodities: for the Countrey affords them good store of Mines of
Silver and Brass, but of Gold or Iron, not many as yet have been found. The Rivers
abound plentifully with Fish, and the Woods with Venison, and some other
wild Beasts. The Countrey is generally more mountainous than plain, frequently
shaded with Woods, and whole Forrests of the stateliest Pine-Trees and Oaks that
are to be seen; amongst which breed abundance of Wolves, which do great mischief
to the People, as also Scorpions and <i>Mustiecho</i>’s. The Hurts receiv’d from
Scorpions, are heal’d with the Juice of the Fruit call’d <i>Queon</i>; those from the <i>Mustiecho</i>’s,
by Vinegar and the Juice of Lemmon. Here is likewise a green Stone,
accounted a soveraign Medicine against the Gravel.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Several sorts of <i>Tunas</i>-Trees.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Trees peculiar to this Countrey, are, the <i>Tunas</i>, already spoken of in <i>Guatimala</i>,
and thought to be the same we vulgarly call <i>Indian Fig-Trees</i>, and are distinguish’d
into six sorts.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first, by the <i>Portuguese</i> call’d <i>Cardon</i>, hath sharp Prickles, thick Leaves, full
of slimy Juice, an odoriferous Flower, oval Fruit, cover’d with an Orange-colour’d
Rind, and small Roots: The Fruit within consists of a white juicy, and
well tasted Pulp, full of black Seed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second hath a round Body full of Boughs, with Star-like Prickles hanging
downwards, the Flower white, and the Fruit very like that of the <i>Cardon</i>,
onely smaller.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>
<img src='images/i_320.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>The third is the <i>Caxabra</i>, which shoots up to a great Tree full of prickly Cods;
at the utmost end grows a large white Flower; the Fruit, which is as big again as
an Egg, is pleasant and cooling.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fourth sort hath a straight Body full of Prickles, runs lesser and lesser to the
top; at the end of the small Boughs, each thick Leaf produces another; the Wood,
if kindled, burns like a Candle.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fifth, nam’d <i>Cumbeba</i>, grows out of small Roots, with three or four corner’d
thick Leaves, full of Prickles, the Flower somewhat less than the former, the Fruit
oval, hard and red, having a white and juicy Pulp: The Prickles of this <i>Cumbeba</i>-Tree
are so sharp, and stick in so deep, that they can scarce be pull’d out. This is
that sort of <i>Tunas</i> that produces <i>Cochinele</i>, which is a Worm that grows under the
Leaves, and is cover’d with a Skin, which being neatly taken off and dry’d in the
Sun, as formerly mention’d, becomes a rich Commodity. <i>Joseph de Acosta</i> tells us,
that the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet, <i>Anno 1578.</i> carried so much <i>Cochinele</i> to <i>Spain</i>, as amounted to
two hundred eighty three thousand seven hundred and fifty Ryals.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the last sort of the <i>Tunas</i> is the <i>Unirumbeba</i>, which hath a straight Body full
of Prickles, on the top whereof grow divers prickly Leaves, not unlike those of
the Palm-Tree: It is onely found in barren places, remote from the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, all kind of Fruits transplanted hither from <i>Spain</i> thrive very well,
as Apples, Pears, Granats, Figs, Peaches, Apricocks, Muskmelons, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Root <i>Castanuela</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Batata</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Root <i>Castanuela</i> affords a much better Feeding for Swine than Acorns. But amongst
many other Roots which are found here, as the <i>Xiquimas</i>, <i>Taca</i>, <i>Cochuco</i>, <i>Cari</i>,
<i>Totora</i> and <i>Mani</i>, the chief is the <i>Batata</i>, which is fat, sweet, and windy; it runs over
the Ground with a tough green Sprig, the new Fibres taking Root dispersedly up
and down, being yellow without, and within full of milky Juice; the Leaf resembling
a Heart, is of a pale yellow colour on the top, and douny underneath;
roasted in Ashes, it eats better than a Turnip: It is divided into three sorts.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first, call’d <i>Omenapo yeima</i>, when boyl’d, shews like red <i>Betel</i>, but Dyes of a
Skye-Colour; the innermost Skin, which is of a dark Red, yields an Ink-like Juice.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>The second sort, call’d <i>Parro</i>, differs little from the first, onely the Body, Root,
and Veins of the Leaves, are of a Purple colour.</p>

<p class='c010'>The third sort <i>Jetiope</i>, being white, hath a very good rellish, and cures the
Ague.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Pepper, which is here call’d <i>Axi</i>, grows in the warmest Valleys, and the
more by being often water’d: there are of it divers kinds, differing in colour,
smell, and taste one from the other; for one sort is green, yellow, or red; another
sort yields a strong musky scent; and one sort is sharper, another milder: the
Veins and Kernels thereof are eaten with Salt.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Herb <i>Cevadilla</i> cures all manner of Sores.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Beasts.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey also breeds an innumerable company of Deer, Hogs, Goats,
Sheep, Oxen, and Horses; and of hurtful Creatures, Pismires, which do great
mischief to the Plants, and Locusts, which fall in huge swarms on the Corn, and
cannot be frighted from the same by any means whatsoever. The want of Water
is also no small prejudice to the Fields.</p>

<p class='c010'>The biggest River, call’d <i>Guadalajara</i>, with many windings runs North-westward
into the Southern Ocean; and four Leagues from the City of the same, falling
down from a steep Rock, it makes such a horrible noise, that it deafens those
which approach the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lake <i>Mechoacan</i> opens here also with a wide Mouth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Two sorts of Hedge-hogs.</div>

<p class='c010'>The River before mention’d, produces all manner of Fish in great abundance;
and also a sort of Hedge-hogs, call’d <i>Iguana</i>, which live both in the Water, and on
the Land, and are of two sorts: The first, call’d <i>Senembi</i>, is four Foot long, of a
deep green colour, with black and white Spots, hath a scaly Skin, white Spots on
each side of the Head, a row of sharp Prickles from the Head to the Tail, wide
Nostrils, great black Eyes, and little Teeth. The second sort, call’d <i>Tejaguacu</i>, differs
from the first, in having white Spots on a brown Skin, a longer Tail, and a
red Tongue, which is slit. Both sorts are reported to fast eight Moneths together;
and though often terribly wounded, and dead to all imagination, yet live a great
while after; and though they swim up and down in Rivers, yet they Lay their
Eggs in the Sand: their Flesh boyl’d is both wholsom, and of a good relish.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The manner of the <i>Spaniards</i> living.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spaniards</i> which inhabit <i>New Gallicia</i>, drive a considerable Trade in Merchandizing,
Husbandry, breeding of Cattel, and working in the Mines: They use
Wayns and Carrs, drawn by Oxen, Mules, and Horses, to carry their Loads, as also
<i>Spanish</i> Weights and Measures. They are little troubled with any other Mischiefs
but what may happen from the treacherous Natives, who take all opportunities to
run into the Woods, that there they may exercise their <i>Pagan</i> Religion in freedom;
in which having spent some time, they gather a considerable number together, and
oftentimes fall unawares on the <i>Spaniards</i>, who use Leather Shields and Helmets,
and furr’d Cotton Clothes, to secure them from the Arrows which the <i>Indians</i>, lying
in Ambuscades, shoot at them out of the Bushes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Nature, Habits, and Customs of the Natives.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Natives, though subtile, are lazy, and will not work, unless for great Rewards.
They wear Cotton Shirts, square Cloaks of the same Stuff, made fast with
two Buttons on their Breasts; Drawers, and soal’d Shoes: Flag-Matts serve them
for Beds, on which they lie under Cotton Clothes: About their Necks, Arms,
and Legs, they wear green Stones, and Snale Shells for an Ornament. Their
greatest Recreation is Dancing, their Musick being nothing else but the noise or
sound of a piece of hollow Wood. Horse-flesh, and Bread made of <i>Maiz</i>, is by
them accounted a great Dainty. The Drink <i>Cacao</i> is also highly esteem’d amongst
them; but much more the Wine that they make of <i>Maquey</i>, which is the wonderful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>Tree that affords many necessary things, <i>viz.</i> Syrrup, Honey, Oyl, Vinegar,
Yarn, Needles, Water, and Wine; every Man making it his Business to plant and
preserve the same with great care near his House, notwithstanding they grow in
several places of the Fields; they have broad thick Leaves with sharp ends, out of
which is drawn a Thorn, which serves them for a Needle or Pin. These Leaves
have a hairy Filament about them, which serves in stead of Thred: the young
Sprout being cut, produces a sweet Juice, which boyl’d, makes good Wine; when
grown sowre, serves for Vinegar; but being twice boyl’d, becomes a Syrrup; and
being hung over the Fire a third time, a perfect Honey: Also the Wood being
spungie, keeps Fire as well as Match. Moreover, the Inhabitants when they travel,
carry Leather Bags with them full of <i>Cacao</i>, <i>Maiz</i>, and Pepper, mix’d together.</p>

<p class='c010'>Over each Village in this Countrey the <i>Spaniards</i> have plac’d an <i>Indian Casique</i>,
<i>Alcalde</i>, and <i>Alguazil</i>, where all sorts of Provisions are sold at a Set-price.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Casiques</i> are succeeded by their Heirs, who resent nothing worse than Affronts,
and take pride in nothing more than their Valour.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Moors</i> or <i>Negro</i>’s which are brought hither from <i>Guinee</i>, do all manner of
hard Labour.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Guachichiles</i> and <i>Guamares</i> area valiant People, and have each their peculiar
Language, utterly different from the <i>Mexican</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Division of <i>Nova Gallicia</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey comprehends these inferior Provinces: 1. <i>Guadalajara</i>; 2. <i>Xalisco</i>;
3. <i>Chiametta</i>; 4. <i>Couliacan</i>; 5. <i>Cinoloa</i>; all of them on the Western Shore.
6. <i>Zacatecas</i>, to which some add <i>Nova Biscaia</i> and <i>Nova Mexico</i>, though others treat
of them as distinct Countreys apart from the rest.</p>

<h4 id='c284' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. II.</span><br /> Guadalajara.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Bounds of <i>Guadalajara</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Guadalajara</i> is bounded on the West, with <i>Xalisco</i>; on the South and South-West,
with <i>New Spain</i>; and on the North, with <i>Zacatecas</i>. It is a Countrey
exceeding pleasant, and rich in all kind of Commodities, but especially
in its Mines of Silver. It is well water’d with the River <i>Barania</i>, which runneth
through the midst of it, and with divers other Streams: yielding abundantly
both Wheat, <i>Maiz</i>, and some other Grain. In a word, there is nothing said of the
properties of <i>New Gallicia</i> in general, either for Soil, Climate, or People, but is peculiarly
verifi’d of this Province.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and Cities.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chief Towns are 1. <i>Guadalajara</i>, which gives Name to the whole Province.
It is seated on the Banks of the River <i>Barania</i>, in a most delectable and sweet Air,
and a rich Soil, by advantage whereof it is become the Metropolis of <i>New Gallicia</i>,
honour’d with an Episcopal See, which was translated thither from <i>Compostella</i> in
the Year 1570. with the Courts of Judicature, and the Residence of the King’s
Treasurers for that Province. This City was built on the Plain <i>Molino</i>, by <i>Nunnez
de Guzman</i>, in the Year 1531. The neighboring Mountains afford store of Timber.
All manner of <i>Spanish</i> Plants grow here likewise in great plenty. In the City is a
Cathedral, several Cloysters, inhabited by <i>Augustine</i> and <i>Franciscan</i> Monks. The
Bishop of this City belongs to the Arch-bishop of <i>Mexico</i>. The Air very temperate,

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Xalisco</i>, or <i>Galesco</i>, as some call it, is bounded on the North, with <i>Couliacan</i>;
on the South, with some parts of <i>New Spain</i>; on the East, with the Province
of <i>Guadalajara</i>; and on the West, with the Gulf or Bay of <i>California</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey is chiefly fertile in <i>Maiz</i> and Mines of Silver, not altogether so apt
for Herbage and Pasture as some other Countreys about it. The People were Cannibals
before the <i>Spaniards</i> came amongst them, eating Man’s-flesh; were much
given to quarrelling and Contentions amongst themselves, but by this time, ’tis
suppos’d they are reasonably well reclaim’d both from the one and the other.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns of chief note.</div>

<p class='c010'>In this Countrey, besides many other goodly Streams, is the great and famous
River <i>Barania</i>, on the Banks whereof are seated most of their principal Towns,
as 1. <i>Xalisco</i>, which gives Name to the whole Province, and to a large Promontory
or Foreland on the Western Coasts, which shoots it self out into the Bay of <i>California</i>,
right over against certain Islands, which the <i>Spaniards</i> call The <i>Three Maries</i>.
This was an ancient City or Town of the Natives, but sack’d and taken by <i>Nunnez
de Gusman</i>, in the Year 1530.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Compostella</i>, built by the aforesaid <i>Gusman</i>, and so nam’d from the City in
<i>Spain</i>, so famous for the Grave of <i>James</i> the Apostle, who (according to the <i>Roman</i>
Writers) was buried there, lies near the South Sea on a barren Soil, within the
<i>Torrid Zone</i>; yet the Ground breeds many sorts of Vermine, besides other noxious
Creatures; amongst which the <i>Capybara</i> roots up whole Trees and other Plants in
the Night. This Beast, resembling an indifferent large Hog, hath short Legs and
Claws, thick Head, with a Beard, wide Ears, and on each Jaw-bone twenty four
Teeth, besides two Tusks, but no Tail; it goes slow, but swims exceeding fast,
and dives under Water for a considerable time together; they often feed together
in great Herds, and make a terrible noise.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns of principal note.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chief Town of this Province is <i>Sant Sebastian</i>, call’d from the River upon
which it stands; it was built by Captain <i>Franciscus de Yvarra</i>, <i>Anno 1554.</i> who discovering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>many Silver Mines, hath made several Melting-houses, in which the Silver

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Next to <i>Chiametla</i>, Westward and Southward of <i>Cinoloa</i>, lies <i>Couliacan</i>, Coasting
all along the Bay of <i>California</i>, which it hath on the West; on the
East it hath <i>New Biscay</i>; and on the South, <i>Xalisco</i>. The Countrey is not
defective in any kind of necessary Provision, but more especially it aboundeth with
Fruits of all sorts. But the <i>Spaniards</i> look onely at the Mines, of which they have
some few in this Countrey. The People were generally Cloth’d with Cotton-Wooll
when the <i>Spaniards</i> came first amongst them, but yet never a whit the more
modest, being exceedingly given to Venery, and that in a more shameless and
beastly manner than many other <i>Americans</i> who went naked.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spanish</i> Towns are these, 1. <i>Hiustula</i>, seated on the Banks of a fair River,
distant about a days Journey from the Sea. 2. <i>Quinola.</i> 3. <i>Quatrobarrios</i>, an old
Town of the Natives, but new nam’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>. 4. <i>El Leon</i>, an old Burrough.
5. <i>Couliacan</i>, the chief Town of the Province. 6. <i>St. Michael</i>, in the Valley
of <i>Arroba</i>, two Leagues distant from the Sea, in a rich and plentiful Countrey, both
for Corn and Fruit, whither it was remov’d from the Banks of the River <i>Orala</i>,
where it first stood; it was built by <i>Nunnez de Gusman</i> in the Year 1531. after he
had burnt the Towns, and destroy’d a great number of the Natives, Inhabitants of
the Countrey.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Nunnez de Gusman</i> first Discoverer of this Countrey.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Serpents worshipp’d by the Natives.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey was first discover’d by the aforesaid <i>Nunnez de Gusman</i> (after he
had built <i>Guadalajara</i>) after this manner: Marching from <i>Chiametla</i> to <i>Piatzala</i>, he
ruin’d this Province with Fire and Sword: he likewise conquer’d the Countreys
of <i>Zapuatun</i> and <i>Piaztla</i>; the first being a Plain, lay inclos’d within high Mountains,
where the <i>Spaniards</i> met none but Women, till they came to a great River
call’d <i>De la Sall</i>, whose Banks on each side were well inhabited; the second juts
against the Ocean, and is water’d by a River of the same Denomination. Here,
within the Houses, (which are built after a strange manner) lay thousands of Serpents
mingled together, with their Heads sticking out on the top and at the sides,
and hissing with open Mouth at those which approached them. The Inhabitants
shew’d great Reverence to these Serpents, because (as they said) the Devil often appear’d
to them in that form. And this seems to be a Custome amongst them from
the Tradition of <i>Eves</i> being tempted by the Devil in the shape of a Serpent: Nor
was this Superstition peculiar onely to these <i>Indians</i>, forasmuch as divers Nations
of the ancient <i>Heathens</i> of other parts of the World, worshipp’d the Likeness of a
Serpent. And even amongst the <i>Greeks</i>, according to <i>Plutarch</i>, <i>Hesychius</i>, <i>Clemens
Alexandrinus</i>, and others, it was no unusual thing in their religious Worship to call
on <i>Eva</i>, and at the same time to shew a Serpent. <i>Plutarchus</i> and <i>Ælianus</i> say, That
the <i>Egyptians</i> honour’d a Serpent for their God. The same saith <i>Erasmus Stella</i> of
the old <i>Prussians</i>; <i>Sigismund Baro</i>, of the <i>Liflanders</i>; and <i>Alexander Guaginus</i>, of the
<i>Sarmatians</i> and <i>Samogethes</i>. Moreover, some write, that in the Province of <i>Calecut</i>
are Serpents with exceeding great Heads, and weighing as much as a great Hog,
to which the King shews great Reverence; so that it seems the Devil takes delight
to be worship’d in that shape wherein he work’d the Fall of Man-kind.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Gusman</i> leaving <i>Piaztla</i> march’d to <i>Bayla</i>, where he found the great River <i>De Mugeres</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>and the Countrey full of Woods and Pastures: thence travelling upwards
along <i>Mugueres</i>, they ascended to the top of a Mountain, where they were assaulted
by the Inhabitants of the aforesaid Village <i>Quinola</i>, whom nevertheless they soon
put to flight; but not long after receiv’d a shrew’d Repulse at the Entrance into a
Wood built full of Houses; yet nevertheless being at length Conquerors, though
not without sufficient loss, they march’d farther in amongst the Mountains, till
their Provisions beginning to grow scarce, and they seeing no likelihood of getting
to an end of this troublesom Journey, at last their Necessities forc’d them to
retire.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Flying Fishes.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Flood which comes out of the Sea up to the City <i>St. Michael</i>, through the
River <i>Cignatlan</i>, abounds with Fish, and especially the <i>Guarapucu</i>, which is seven
Foot long when it comes to its full growth; it hath no Scales, but smooth Skin
of a Silver colour mix’d with Green: from the Head to the Tail runs a crooked
Line of thin Scales on each side; it swims exceeding swift, feeds on lesser Fishes,
and spawns in the Sea: the Flesh being wholsom and good to eat, is salted up
against Winter. At the same Place is also the <i>Piracarba</i>, which shines exceedingly,
having Silver-colour’d Scales, a broad slit Tail, a long white Beard, four great
Fins, and a little Head. Farther into the Sea are a sort of flying Fish, call’d <i>Pirabebes</i>,
which rise by thousands up out of the Water, so escaping the <i>Dolphins</i> and
other Fish which prey on them; yet sometimes they are snatch’d up by the Birds,
or else by the Fishes, when they dive down into the Water to wet their own
Wings, which consist of a thin Skin, distinguish’d in length by tough Fins. These
flying Fish also differ much one from another, for most of them are like Herrings;
others have a thick Head, round before like the Dolphins.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, the Countrey about <i>St. Michael</i> was always well inhabited. The
Houses, being artificially built, were adorn’d on the top with many obscene Images,
and venereal Representations: But since the <i>Spaniards</i> have conquer’d this
Countrey they have destroy’d them, and built other Houses in their stead, and also
bestow’d much cost and labour on the Silver Mines <i>De las Virgines</i>.</p>

with <i>Couliacan</i> on the South. This Country, besides the general fertility of the whole

the <i>Americans</i> are; is exceedingly well water’d with Rivers, which descend
from those Mountains <i>Tepecsuan</i>, not above thirty or forty Leagues distant from

as yet remain unreduc’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Nunnez de Gusman</i>’s Travels.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Province was also discover’d by <i>Nunnez de Gusman</i>, who having rested
some Weeks in <i>St. Michael</i>, proceeding on his Way, he Ferried over the River <i>Petatlan</i>,
which receiv’d that Denomination because the Houses were cover’d with

<p class='c010'>Between <i>Petatlan</i> and <i>Tamochala</i> lie several desolate Wildernesses, and Woods of
the <i>Brasile</i>-Tree.</p>

<p class='c010'>But <i>Gusman</i> travelling up twenty seven Leagues along the fore-mention’d River
<i>Tamochala</i>, came to the Province <i>Cinoloa</i>, where they stay’d six Weeks, by reason
of the abundance of Rains; during which time the Villagers provided them
Turtle-Doves, Hares, Rabbets, and all sorts of Fowls; but at last deserted their
Habitations in the Night: after which the <i>Spaniards</i> crossing <i>Tamochala</i> went along
a barren Desart, where (had they not found Water in certain Wells, and likewise
store of Juice out of the <i>Tunas</i>-Trees) they had without doubt perish’d; at last getting
over the River <i>Yaguinu</i>, they found a deserted Village, out of which a broad
Path led along the Stream; whither <i>Gusman</i> marching, he came into a Plain, where
he spy’d several <i>Indians</i>, which after some resistance were routed by the <i>Spanish</i>
Horse.</p>

especially the more Western part of it, is very rich in Silver Mines, no Province of
this part of <i>America</i> richer; but not so apt either for Wheat or <i>Maiz</i>. But the Eastern
parts of it are abundantly stor’d with all sorts of Fruits, the Woods every

giving Entertainment to some Bird or other.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and Villages.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Towns are 1. <i>Las Zacatecas</i>, forty Leagues distant from <i>Guadalajara</i>, and
fourscore from <i>Mexico</i>, but neighbor’d with most rich Mines, and therefore both
Garrison’d and well peopled by the <i>Spaniards</i>; for ’tis suppos’d there are no less

who having subdu’d and quieted the Natives, and thereby gain’d to himself the
Government of these Countreys, granted the propriety of some Silver Mines both
to the <i>Spaniards</i> and to the Natives, and by that means drew so many of them thither,
that in a short time it became the chiefest and best peopled town of the whole

<div class='sidenote'>Several Mines discover’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The aforesaid <i>Franciscus de Yvarra</i>, <i>Anno 1554.</i> discover’d the Mine call’d <i>Sant
Martin</i>, and since also <i>Lucas Avinno</i>, the Mine <i>Del Sombrereto</i>, lying near the City <i>Del
Erena</i>: but the Mines <i>De los Ranchos</i>, <i>Chalchuites</i>, <i>De las Nieves</i>, and <i>Del Frisuillo</i>, would
produce much more Silver, if the Mine-works were stor’d with Quicksilver. The
Vice-Roy of <i>New Spain</i>, nam’d <i>Lodowick de Velasco</i>, order’d a certain number of Soldiers,
Slaves, Horses and Mules, for every Mine, to defend the Workmen from the
Assaults of the Natives, which oftentimes Sallied out upon them. Moreover, <i>Velasco</i>
sent Priests through all the Countrey to Preach the <i>Gospel</i>: But <i>Yvarra</i> having
the care of the Priests, guarded them with a company of Soldiers, and in his Way
discover’d the Valley <i>San Juan</i>, and the River <i>De las Nacos</i>, where he conquer’d
the rebelling Natives.</p>

<p class='c010'>Near the Silver Mine <i>Sant Martins</i> the Monks built a Cloyster; after which <i>Yvarra</i>
gave free leave to all that would, to dig in the Mine at <i>Avinno</i>, which he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>bought, on condition they should pay the real fifth part of what they got, to the
<i>Spanish King</i>: which Priviledge stirr’d up many, insomuch that <i>Avinno</i> in a short
time grew very populous. <i>Yvarra</i>, though having brought his Business to this pass,
could not rest, but sent <i>Antonius Pacheco</i> to a Valley in <i>Guadiana</i>, to build the foremention’d
City <i>Durango</i>, where several Rivers make a convenient and delightful
place for Habitation, whither <i>Yvarra</i> follow’d three Moneths after, and finish’d the
new Town. But the chiefest Silver Mines, which borrow their Denominations
from the Province <i>Zacatecas</i>, are continually guarded by five hundred <i>Spaniards</i>,
and as many Slaves.</p>

stor’d with all manner of Provisions, and erected there by him, as a place of defence
against the <i>Chichimecæ</i>, who (though the <i>Spaniards</i> kept the place with strong
Guards) kill’d above four hundred of their Horses and Mules; which loss no way
daunted him, so as to change his Resolution of going to <i>Topia</i>: whither travelling,
he found many snowy Mountains, and suffer’d extream Cold, which kill’d most of
their Horses; being seen fifteen days after to stand so stiffly frozen, as if still alive:
at last getting within the Borders of <i>Topia</i>, after he had suffer’d many inconveniences,

Rock, without any ordinary way of access to it, but by a pair of Stairs hewn out
of the hard Stone, or else by certain Ladders, which the Inhabitants let down and
take up as they please. And likewise of a third, which they call <i>Conibas</i>, containing,
as they say, no less than seven Leagues in length, and about half so much in breadth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>seated upon a Lake, but scatteringly built, and much of the space taken up with
Mountains and many fair Gardens, in the midst of which the Town standeth;
of all which more hereafter. This is certain, that the Countrey to which they give
the Name of <i>New Mexico</i>, is of a vast extent, reaching from the Mines of <i>St. Barbara</i>
in <i>New Biscay</i> Eastward, and to the North-East, above two hundred Leagues already
discover’d, but doubtless taking up no small part of those Countreys which
are sometimes assign’d to <i>Florida</i>, if not of the Confines of <i>Virginia</i> also.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Travels of <i>Ruyz</i>, <i>Espejus</i> and others.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey was first, <i>Anno 1581.</i> discover’d by a <i>Franciscan</i> Monk, nam’d
<i>Augustine Ruyz</i>, who with two other Monks of his Order, got eight Soldiers of
<i>Conde de Coruna</i>, Vice-Roy of <i>New Spain</i>, for his Companions; with whom he travell’d
from the Valley <i>Sant Bartholomew</i>, to the Province <i>De los Tiguas</i>, where one
of the two Monks was kill’d by the Natives, which occasion’d such a fear amongst
the Souldiers, who judg’d themselves too weak to make any resistance, that they
resolv’d to return, notwithstanding all the arguments which <i>Ruyz</i> us’d to disswade
them from it; yet nevertheless he and his Brother <i>Franciscus Lopez</i> and four <i>Indians</i>,
went onward of their Journey; which news the Souldiers carried back to
the <i>Franciscans</i> in <i>Sant Bartholomew</i>; who fearing their Brethren would be destroy’d,
sent several Souldiers and a Monk, call’d <i>Bernardyn Beltran</i>, after them, who were
also accompanied by <i>Antony Espejus</i>, who spent a great part of his Estate in raising of
Men, providing Arms and Provisions, loading therewith a hundred and fifty
Horses and Mules; with which he travell’d direct North from the fore-mention’d
Valley, and after two days Journey found a People call’d <i>Conchi</i>, who went naked,
and liv’d in Huts built together like a Village: They were Govern’d by <i>Casiques</i>,
fed on Hares, Deer, Rabbets, <i>Maiz</i>, <i>Calabashes</i>, and Melons. Several adjacent Rivers
afford them plenty of Fish. They were amaz’d at the Crosses which the <i>Spaniards</i>
there erected, till they were inform’d of a Crucifi’d Saviour. <i>Espejus</i> being
every where kindly Entertain’d amongst them, and conducted twenty two Leagues
farther, came amongst the <i>Indians</i> call’d <i>Passaguates</i>, of the like Constitution with the
<i>Conchi</i>’s; who had skill in Minerals, and judg’d that there were many Silver Mines
in that Countrey. From whence the <i>Passaguates</i> travell’d with the <i>Spaniards</i> to the
Borders of the <i>Los Tobosos</i>, who no sooner saw them, but they fled, because a few
years before they had been miserably dealt with by the <i>Spaniards</i>; but being inform’d
by the Interpreters, that they needed not be afraid of any thing, they all appear’d,
and conducted <i>Espejus</i> to the Borders of the <i>Patarabueyes</i>; which People possess a
large Countrey, Stone Houses and Villages built in good order. Great Rivers
which come out of the North, and others that disembogu’d into the North Sea, afforded
them all sorts of Fish; as also the Woods plenty of Venison, Fowls, and
wholsom Plants. In some Pools also the salt Water afforded Salt.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Valour of the Inhabitants may sufficiently appear by the rough Entertainment
which the <i>Spaniards</i> met withall the first Night; for the <i>Patarabueyes</i> fell so
fiercely upon them, that had not the Watch given notice thereof in time, none had
escap’d with Life; nevertheless five Horses were kill’d, and a considerable number
of Men wounded: after which retreating, they went upon a neighboring Hill,
whither <i>Espejus</i> sent his Interpreter, and an <i>Indian</i> the same Countrey, to inform
them, That the <i>Spaniards</i> came not to molest them, and if they pleas’d to come to
them, they should meet with none but Friends; which was the more easily credited,
because the <i>Casiques</i> receiv’d some Presents; after which being reconciled, they
conducted the <i>Spaniards</i> twelve days Journey up a long River, whose Banks were
inhabited in several places. From thence they reach’d to a Place, inhabited by a
People richly Cloth’d, who also seem’d to have some knowledge of God; for in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>their Discourse they pointed up to Heaven, call’d the Creator and Preserver of all
things <i>Apalito</i>, and signifi’d that they had receiv’d that Knowledge formerly from
those that were left of <i>Pamphilius Narvaez</i>’s Army, who having rang’d through
<i>Florida</i> were driven hither.</p>

<p class='c010'>These People also Presented <i>Espejus</i> many tann’d Skins, with which he went to
a great Village, the Inhabitants whereof were very courteous, and barter’d them
for brave Plumes of Feathers and Cotton Cloaks, streak’d with blue and white:
but <i>Espejus</i> having no Interpreters whom they could understand, could not learn
by what Name they were known; yet by signs they express’d what time of the year
they had Precious Stones brought to them; and also what their Countrey produced;
and also that abundance of those Riches was to be found in a Province about
five days Journey Westward from thence, whither they freely offer’d to conduct
the <i>Spaniards</i>, which accordingly they did, bearing them company one and twenty
Leagues to the next Province, inhabited by a People whose Name also they could
not be inform’d of, yet staying three days amongst them, they were Entertain’d with
Presents and Dances both Night and Day. The Countrey afforded them also store
of Venison and Fruits: Those that understood Minerals, judg’d that there were
likewise several Gold Mines.</p>

<p class='c010'>Leaving this Province, they entred into a great Wilderness of Pine-Trees, in
which they travell’d twelve Leagues in fifteen days, without seeing either Man
or House; but at the end of the Wood they spy’d a Village of Straw Huts, where
there were great quantities of white Salt, and Deer Skins neatly dress’d. The People
of the Place courteously Entertain’d the <i>Spaniards</i>, and conducted them along
the River <i>Del Norte</i>, to <i>New Mexico</i>: The Banks of the River on each side was planted
with Nut-Trees and Vines, which spread themselves out above three Leagues;
through which they had scarce pass’d three days together, when they saw ten populous
Villages pleasantly seated on the said River, from whence came many thousands
of the Natives to meet <i>Espejus</i>, who was not so much amaz’d at the great
number of People, as at their extraordinary Civility and decent Habits; for they
Entertain’d him with well dress’d Meat, roasted Poultrey, and pleasant Fruits:
Their Garments were Cotton Cloaks, Deer-skin Breeches, Shoes and Boots of good
Leather. The Women wore their Hair neatly Comb’d and Pleited. Their Houses
were almost four Stories high, handsomely built, and divided into fair Chambers,
had Stoves or Cells under Ground against the Cold in the Winter. Every Village
was Govern’d by a <i>Casique</i>, whose Commands were publish’d by the <i>Alguaziles</i>. Each
House had a peculiar place in which their Idol stood, before whom they set Meat
twice a day. Near the High-ways stood Temples very curiously painted, wherein
their Deity, as they say, diverted himself in his Progress from one Village to another.
At certain Distances near their Plough’d Lands, stood <i>Portico</i>’s, supported on
four Columns, under which the Husband-man us’d to eat, and take his Noon-sleep.
Besides their Swords, which were strong enough to cut a Man through the Middle,
they us’d Bowes and Arrows: Their Shields were made of Deer Skins.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Espejus</i> having stay’d here four days, went to the Province <i>De las Tiguas</i>, which
had sixteen Villages; in the chiefest whereof, call’d <i>Poala</i>, <i>Augustine Ruyz</i> and his
Brother Monk <i>Franciscus de Lopez</i> had been slain, besides four others; wherefore
the People being conscious of this Crime, and fearing that Revenge would follow,
fled to the Mountains, from whence they could not be enticed, whilst the <i>Spaniards</i>
found their Houses full of Provisions and some Minerals.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now those being dead whom they sought for, some thought it convenient to return;
but <i>Espejus</i> and <i>Beltran</i> perswaded the contrary, alledging, That farther up,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>according to the <i>Indians</i> information, lay several Provinces which were worth the
discovery, and advis’d that the chiefest part of their Forces might stay there, whilst
they and some few resolute Men went farther upon the Discovery, which accordingly
was perform’d. <i>Espejus</i> having travell’d two days, came into a fruitful
Province, jutting against <i>Cibola</i>, in which he found eleven Villages, inhabited by
above fourteen thousand People, who were clad in Skins and Cotton, worshipp’d
many Idols, and receiv’d the <i>Spaniards</i> with great Civility.</p>

<p class='c010'>The like Entertainment they met withall in the Countrey <i>Los Quires</i>, wash’d by
the River <i>Del Norte</i>; near which stood five Villages, inhabited by about fifteen
thousand People.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thirteen Leagues farther they found <i>De los Cunames</i>, having also five Villages, the
chiefest of which being <i>Cia</i>, boasted (as above mention’d) eight Market-places:
The Houses, made of Lime, were neatly Painted, and compris’d in all above
twenty thousand Persons, all civil People, who presented <i>Espejus</i> and his Company
with handsom Cloaks, set good boyl’d Meat before them, and shew’d them rich
Minerals, and the Mountains out of which they got the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of the like Constitution were the Inhabitants <i>De los Amires</i>, which being thirty
thousand in number, resided in seven well built Villages, lying North-West from
<i>Cunames</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>After this they march’d Westward, and found the eminent Village <i>Acoma</i>, mention’d
before, built on an exceeding high Rock, to which led onely a narrow Path
up a pair of Stairs cut in the Rock; as also many Wells to receive Rain, besides
what they have out of a River, led by Moats round about their Plough’d Lands.
The <i>Spaniards</i> staying here three days, were Entertain’d with all sorts of good Meat,
Dances and Drolls.</p>

<p class='c010'>From hence travelling twenty four Leagues more Westerly, they entred the Province
of <i>Zuny</i>; where the erected Crosses which had remain’d there till that time,
were sufficient testimonies of <i>Cornaro</i>’s having been there, after he was deserted by
<i>Andreas de Cuyocan</i>. <i>Casper de Mexico</i>, and <i>Antonius de Guadalajara</i>, being setled on <i>Zuny</i>,
(otherwise call’d <i>Cibola</i>) and speaking the <i>Indian</i> Tongue better than their Native
Language, inform’d <i>Espejus</i>, that sixty days Journey farther lay a great Lake,
whose Shores were crown’d with many brave Villages, inhabited by a People
which wore Golden Armlets and Ear-rings; whither <i>Franciscus Vasquez</i> had gone
a second time, had not Death prevented him. This Information so encourag’d
<i>Espejus</i>, that notwithstanding it was so great a Journey, yet he resolv’d to venture
thither, though the Monk <i>Beltran</i> and most of his Company perswaded him to the
contrary; whereupon <i>Beltran</i> return’d: After which <i>Espejus</i> went on to the said
Lake; whither he was accompanied with a hundred and fifty <i>Indians</i>. Having gone
twenty six Leagues, he found a populous Province, whose Borders he no sooner
approach’d, but he was told, <i>That if he was willing to lose his Life, he and his Party might
enter into a forbidden Dominion</i>; yet notwithstanding this threatning Message, he
wrought so much upon the <i>Casique</i> by the Presents which he sent him, that he was
permitted to come in freely; nay, the Inhabitants of <i>Zaguato</i> strow’d Meal on the
Earth for the <i>Spaniards</i> to go over, and presented <i>Espejus</i> at his departure with forty
thousand Cotton Cloaks, and a considerable quantity of Plate, which he sent with
five of his Soldiers, and all the <i>Cibolan Indians</i>, back to <i>Cibola</i>, keeping onely four
Companions and one Guide, with whom he travell’d forty one Leagues Westward;
where he found a Mountain, to the top whereof led a broad Path; which ascending,
he took up Silver Oar with his own Hand. The several sorts of People that
inhabited here were all civil and courteous, living in good fashion, in pretty large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>Houses, built on the Banks of a pleasant River, shaded with Vines and Nut-Trees,
and thick planted with Flax: They inform’d <i>Espejus</i>, that near a River which
runs eight Miles towards the North Sea, were such stately Palaces, as could not
be beheld without great admiration. But <i>Espejus</i> going back a plain Road to <i>Cibola</i>,
found not onely those whom he had sent from <i>Zaguato</i>, but also <i>Beltran</i>, with the
other Soldiers, who having been detained there by the Civilities and kind Entertainments
of the <i>Indians</i>, were now upon returning home; so that <i>Espejus</i> was left
alone with eight Soldiers, who resolv’d to venture their Lives and Fortunes with
him. They travell’d along the River <i>Del Norte</i>, through the Provinces <i>De los Guires</i>
and <i>Habutas</i>, whose Mountains, over-spread with Pine-Trees and Cedars, have
many rich Mines. The Natives wore painted Cotton Cloaks, and dwelt in stately
Houses five Stories high. At the Borders of the Realm <i>Los Tamos</i> they were stopt,
and not permitted to come on farther; wherefore being but few in number, and
several of them sick, they judg’d it convenient to cross the River <i>De las Vaccas</i> (so
call’d from the abundance of Cows that were thereabouts) to the River <i>Conchos</i> and
the Village <i>Bartholomew</i>, where <i>Espejus</i> was inform’d, that <i>Beltran</i> was long before
his arrival gone to <i>Guadiana</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now that we may have the better Account of <i>New Mexico</i> (which <i>Ruyz</i>,
<i>Espejus</i>, and <i>Beltran</i> endeavor’d to discover) it will be necessary to begin with the
first original thereof, according as several ancient Histories make mention.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First original of the <i>New Mexicans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The most ancient Possessors of that part of <i>Northern America</i> call’d <i>New Spain</i>,
were for their fierce and salvage Nature call’d <i>Chichimecæ</i>, who dwelling in Caves,
fed on Moles, Rabbets, Hedghogs, Serpents, Roots and Herbs. Whilst the Women
accompanied their Husbands in their Travels, the Children were put into Baskets,
and hang’d in a Tree. No manner of Government was to be found amongst them.
They never Till’d their Ground till the <i>Navatlacans</i> came from <i>New Mexico</i> (which
was anciently divided into two Countreys, <i>Aztlan</i> and <i>Teuculhuacan</i>) to <i>New Spain</i>;
after which they Sow’d their Lands.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Navatlacans</i> (who us’d to dwell in Houses, worship Images, plough their
Lands, and obey their Governors) were divided into six Tribes, each Tribe possessing
their limited Bounds: and there goes a Tradition, That out of six Pits that
are to be seen in <i>New Mexico</i>, the <i>Navatlacans</i> had their original. The time when
they deserted <i>New Mexico</i>, as their most authentick Histories or Records declare, was
(according to our computation) <i>Anno 940.</i> and they farther affirm, that they spent
forty years in a Journey, which might have been travell’d in a Moneth: The
reason of which tediousness was, because they rested in all places where they found
a fruitful Countrey; but as they had advice from their diabolical Spirits, which (as
they say) appear’d visibly to them, they still went on farther and farther, yet left
behind those that were aged, sick, and decrepid, building convenient Houses for
them, and appointing Overseers to look after them. The Ruins of the Houses are
yet to be seen on the Way along which they pass’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>The six Tribes divided themselves after this manner: Four of them setled
round about the great Lake of <i>Mexico</i>. The <i>Sichumilans</i> taking the South part, built,
besides two other Towns, a Metropolis of their own Name, as the <i>Chalcans</i> on the
North. The <i>Tapunecans</i> built <i>Azcapuzalco</i> in the West, which signifies <i>A Pismires Hole</i>,
because of the abundance of Inhabitants. The Eastern part was taken up by the
<i>Chalhuans</i>. And all these Names have a peculiar signification; the first signifies
<i>People of Flowry Fields</i>; the second, <i>People of Mouthes</i>; the third, <i>People of Bridges</i>; and
the fourth, <i>Crooked People</i>. Not long after, the <i>Tatluicans</i>, a strong People, went over
the Mountains on the other side of the <i>Mexican</i> Lake, where they built several Towns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>on a hot, yet fruitful Soil, the chiefest whereof they call’d <i>Quahunachua</i>, that is, <i>A
Place where an Eagles Voice is heard</i>. The <i>Tlascaltecans</i> went near the Snowy Mountains,
one of which, being between <i>Mexico</i> and <i>De los Angelos</i>, vomits horrid Flames
and Smoke up into the Skie. Here scattering up and down, they built several Villages,
besides the City <i>Tlascalla</i>; the Inhabitants whereof assisted the <i>Spaniards</i>, as
hath been related in the taking of <i>Mexico</i>, for which good Service they live free,
without paying any Tribute.</p>

<p class='c010'>When these six Tribes came first from <i>Mexico</i> thither, the <i>Chichimecans</i> made little
or no resistance against them, but hid themselves amongst the Rocks: yet some of
them not long after taking courage, flew to Arms, and had without doubt destroy’d
the <i>Tlascallans</i>, had not a subtile Plot sav’d them: for under a shew of Friendship
they falling on the unarm’d <i>Chichimecans</i>, kill’d every Man of them.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Joseph de Acosta</i> tells us, that <i>Anno 1586.</i> he saw a Grave in <i>Mexico</i>, wherein a <i>Chichimecan</i>
of a Gygantick size lay buried.</p>

<p class='c010'>After this Conquest gotten by the <i>Tlascallans</i>, the fore-mention’d six Tribes liv’d
in Peace and Quiet, and strengthned themselves the more by Marrying into one
anothers Families.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Chichimecæ</i> keeping on the Mountains left the new People in quiet possession
of their Lands, nay, learnt some of their Customs, insomuch that they began
to build Huts, chuse Governors, and live according to their Laws.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The first March of the <i>Mexicans</i> into <i>New Spain</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Tlascallans</i> having possess’d <i>New Spain</i> three hundred and two years, a seventh
Tribe (a valiant and civiliz’d People) came thither, upon their Dæmon <i>Viztlipuztli</i>’s
promise of having the supream Government: wherefore he was carried in
an Ark by four chief Priests, whom he inform’d whither and when they should
travel or rest, for where ever they stopt, they built a Tent in the middle of their
Army for their Idol, whom they set on an Altar; which done, they Sow’d the
Ground about them: yet if their <i>Dæmon</i> commanded them to march before Harvest,
then they left the Product to the ancient and sick People. But at last <i>Mexi</i>, from
whence the Name of <i>Mexico</i> is deriv’d, conducted the Army into <i>Mechaocan</i>, where
the pleasant Soil among the Lakes entic’d many to take up their Habitation. But
<i>Mexi</i> proceeded on his Journey, yet not without great Crosses, in regard <i>Viztlipuztli</i>’s
Sister (some Inchantress probably so call’d) did much hurt to the whole
Army by her Sorceries, because they would not honor her as a Goddess, till <i>Viztlipuztli</i>
inform’d one of them that carried the Ark, that the Army should march on,
and banish the Witch from them: whereupon she accordingly being driven away,
built the Village <i>Malinalco</i>, as a Habitation for Conjurers. Mean while, the Army grew
weaker and weaker by their leaving so many People behind them in most places;
therefore they judg’d it convenient to rest a while in <i>Tula</i>, where a great River
water’d the Countrey; which, according to <i>Viztlipuztli</i>’s Commands, being dry’d
up, made a large Lake about the Mountain <i>Coatepeck</i>, whose Banks being planted
with Willow and Poplar-Trees, were exceeding pleasant, and the more, because
of the variety of Birds that made their Nests in the same; which so delighted many
of the People, that being tir’d with travelling, they resolv’d to settle there;
which Resolution was so ill resented by <i>Viztlipuztli</i>, that he commanded the Bank to
be broken, that the Water might have liberty to flow its former Course, and threatned
them with heavy punishments: after which in the Night a terrible Cry of
Murder was heard in one part of the Army; which being inquir’d after the next
Morning, they found divers People lying on the Ground with their Breasts cut
open, and their Hearts pull’d out: whereupon those that remain’d went onto
<i>Chapultepec</i>, where they fortifi’d themselves in the Mountains against the adjacent
People, which <i>Copil</i>, Son to the <i>Malinalcon</i> Witch, had rais’d up against them; and
soon after the <i>Tapunecans</i> and <i>Chalcans</i> went against their new Neighbors, with
whom they began a bloody Fight, when <i>Vitzilovitli</i>, at that time General of the
<i>Mexican</i> Army, pressing in amongst them, broke their Ranks, and made way for
all his Army (though with his own Death) to march Conquerors to <i>Culhuacan</i>:
The Prince of which Province gave them a Place to settle on, near the white Water
<i>Ticaapan</i>, whose Shores swarm’d with Adders and Serpents, upon Design that the
Strangers might be destroy’d by them; but it prov’d quite otherwise: for they
without regret eat the poysonous Animals; and Dunging the unfruitful Soil, receiv’d
a plentiful Harvest: They would willingly have setled here, after their so
long ranging up and down, if <i>Viztlipuztli</i> would have approv’d thereof; but he
told them, that they must possess themselves by Arms, and make a <i>Culhuacan</i> Maid
their Goddess: whereupon they desir’d the <i>Casique</i>’s Daughter of <i>Culhuacan</i>, who
was sent them in rich Ornaments, and with a stately Retinue: But she was no
sooner entred on the <i>Ticaapan</i> Shore, but they flay’d her alive, and her Skin being
stuff’d, and nam’d <i>Tocci</i>, was religiously worshipp’d. But not satisfi’d with this
cruelty, they sent for her Father to visit his Daughter in her Dignity; who accordingly
coming with great Attendance, was led into a dark Chappel, where by
the burning Tapers he knew the Goddess to be no other than his Daughters Skin
stuff’d full of Cotton; whereat burning with rage, he afterwards fell upon these
Murderers with all his Forces, and drove them to the Place where they afterwards
built <i>Mexico</i>.</p>

<p><i>Viztlipuztli idolum Mexicanorum.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>We have often made mention heretofore of the Governor of this Journey,
<i>Viztlipuztli</i>, it will therefore be necessary to give an exacter Description of him, as
followeth:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the Image <i>Viztlipuztli</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>He was a woodden Image like a Man, sitting on a blue Seat in a triumphant
Chair; at each end of which was plac’d a Staff with a Serpents Head upon it, from
whose Forehead, which was Painted blue, ran a Streak of the same colour, cross
his Nose to both his Ears; upon his Head stood a Plume of Feathers, the ends
whereof were tipp’d with a golden Varnish; his left Hand held a white Shield, on
which stuck five Feathers, and on the top a Laurel Bough; next the Shield lay four
Arrows, pretended to be sent from Heaven; in his right Hand a Truncheon, full
of blue crooked Streaks like Serpents; behind on his Shoulders appear’d Wings,
not unlike those of a Bat, his Eyes large and round, and his Mouth reaching from
Ear to Ear, made him terrible to behold, also gaping, and full of Teeth, which
stuck out of his Belly; in his Breast also were two fiery Eyes, and under them a
shrivell’d Nose; his Feet ended in Claws, hung round about with Precious Jems,
golden Boxes and Shields set out with divers colour’d Feathers. The Curtain behind
which this Idol sat, was not drawn open except on a Feast-Day.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next <i>Viztlipuztli</i> stood generally a lesser Image, call’d <i>Tlaboc</i>, and also the Goddess
<i>Tocci</i>, Daughter to the Prince of <i>Culhuacan</i>, who (as before mention’d) was
flay’d by their <i>Dæmon</i>’s Command. Since which time they suppos’d, that they
were never more acceptable to their Gods, than when they appear’d Cloth’d in another
Man’s Skin; and accounted no Offering better, than a Heart taken out of
their Enemies Breast, since their Spirit destroy’d so many after that manner in the
Army at <i>Tula</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Tocci</i>’s Festival.</div>

<p class='c010'>But <i>Tocci</i>, they say, had also a Son much inclin’d to Hunting, whose Image they
carry, attended by a thousand People, with the sound of Horns and Trumpets, to
an Arbor on a high Mountain; which being made of green Leaves pleited, had in
the middle an Altar, on which they set the Idol, whilst the Multitude surrounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>the Foot of the Mountain, and set all the Bushes about the same on Fire; which
done, they shouted and hollow’d, and play’d on several Instruments; which frighting
the wild Beasts that lay shelter’d in the Woods, made them run to the top of
the Mountain, where they were more and more inclos’d by the People, insomuch
that many of them were slain for an Offering before <i>Tocci</i>’s Son’s Altar; which
done, they carried the Idol back to his Temple, and the People made Merry with
the slain Venison.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of <i>Tezcatlipuca</i>’s Image.</div>

<p class='c010'>As great Reverence they shew’d to <i>Tezcatlipuca</i>, because (as they said) he pardon’d
their Sins. This Idol was made of a black shining Stone, richly Apparell’d, having
Golden Ear-rings; in his undermost Lip a Silver Sheath, in which stuck sometimes
a green, and sometimes a blue Plume of Feathers; his Hair was ty’d with an
embroider’d String, at the end of which hung a Golden Ear, whereon Smoak was
Painted, signifying the Prayers of oppress’d Sinners; moreover, the String hung
full of Pearls, and about the Neck in a String hung a Jewel; on his Breast, as also
on his Navel, a green Stone; in his left Hand he held a Fan made of a Gold
Plate, in which stuck many colour’d Feathers: this Plate glittering like Glass,
was in stead of a Mirrour for <i>Tezcatlipuca</i>, to observe all worldly Transactions in
the same: and to punish Criminals, he held four Darts in his right Hand. His
Feast they kept once in four years.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Idol also had the Command of Hunger, Drought, Famine, and pestilential
Distempers; wherefore he had quite another shape, sat on a Stool behind a
red Curtain embroider’d with dead Mens Bones and Sculls; his Body Coal black,
his Head stuck full of Quails Feathers, a Quiver with four Arrows in his left, and
a Rod in his right Hand, which made the Image seem very terrible.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Idol <i>Quetzalcoalt</i>, being their Guardian over the Merchants, was plac’d in a
high Temple, being shap’d like a Man, his Face onely excepted; for that resembled

<h3 id='c298' class='c001'>CHAP. IX.<br /> Cibola, Tontonteac, and Nova Granada.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>Though the Province of <i>Zuny</i> above-mention’d in the Chapter of <i>New
Mexico</i>, in the Voyage of <i>Espejus</i>, be there otherwise call’d, and appear to
be the same with <i>Cibola</i>, yet we find it not treated of by any as part of
<i>New Mexico</i>, but by some as a distinct Province, by others as a part of <i>California</i>
largely taken; for besides that <i>California</i>, properly so call’d, hath formerly been taken
rather for a <i>Peninsula</i> than an Island, and still affords to some an Argument of
question, whether it be one or the other. The whole extent of the Province generally
so term’d, hath been reputed to comprehend the suppos’d <i>Peninsula</i> it self, <i>Cibola</i>,
<i>Quivira</i>, and <i>Nova Albion</i>; but since, according to the best Maps and Discoveries,
there seems little doubt to be made, that <i>California</i>, strictly taken, is a perfect
Island: and since upon that Consideration we have reserved it to be describ’d
amongst the Islands of <i>Northern America</i>, we also consequently judge it most requisite
to consider those Countreys apart that were included in the extended <i>California</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Situation, Temperature, and Productions of <i>Cibola</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span><i>Cibola</i> lieth Southward of <i>Quivira</i>, betwixt it and <i>New Gallicia</i>, to the North and
East: on the West it hath <i>Mar Vermiglio</i>, or the Bay of <i>California</i>. The Air of the
Province is indifferently temperate, especially if compar’d to the sharp Frosts and
Colds of <i>Quivira</i>. The Countrey is for the most part level and plain, as <i>Quivira</i> is,
having but few Trees in it, except here and there some Woods of Cedars, which
yet do abundantly supply the Natives both with Timber and Fewel. The Ground
affords plenty of <i>Maiz</i>, and some small white Pease, of both which they usually
make Bread. There is great store of Venison, and a kind of Sheep (as they say, and
as it should seem by their Fleece) as big as some little Horses or Oxen, some of their
Horns weighing forty or fifty Pound: But perhaps by some mistake of Authors,
this Beast may be no other than <i>Taurus Mexicanus</i>, elsewhere describ’d, whose Hair
is extreamly thick and shaggy, and of which they make Cloth as of Wool, as hath
been said. There are also Lyons, Bears, and Tygers in this Province, in such
numbers, that the People of the Countrey are not a little troubled with them, and
would gladly destroy them if they knew how. The People are generally well
Limb’d, tall of Stature, and seem to be a little more Ingenious than their Neighbors
of <i>Quivira</i>; yet they go naked many of them, onely cover’d with Mantles made
of Skins, which are many times painted, and that with such Curiosity and Art, as
do sufficiently argue, that neither themselves nor their Neighbors of <i>Quivira</i>, from
whom they have them in Traffick, do make them, but that they are the Merchandise
and Commodity of some other Nations, perhaps of <i>Cathay</i> or <i>China</i>, who, by
the North-West Seas, do Trade with the Maritime Parts, and People of <i>Quivira</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This part of the Countrey hath been reasonably well search’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>,
but as yet nothing discover’d so considerable, as to perswade them to stay in it.</p>

<p class='c010'>That which seems most observable, is the great Lake <i>Tonteac</i>, situate almost in
the midst of the Province; upon which, or near unto it, they found seven or eight
old Towns of the Natives, some whereof contain’d four or five hundred of their
Cottages or little Houses, and were fortifi’d also with Ramparts, and other Works
of Defence, so as the <i>Spaniards</i> could not become Masters of them, but by Force and
Storming: In the attempt whereof <i>Vasquez Coronado</i>, their Commander in chief,
was twice beaten down with Stones by the Natives; yet at last carrying the Place,
he found in it good plenty of <i>Maiz</i> indeed, which was some refreshment to his
Army, but nothing else: whereupon having nam’d the Place <i>Granada</i>, in memory
of the Vice-Roy of <i>New Spain</i>, who sent him upon that Expedition, he departed.
In his return homeward he fell upon a certain Countrey, which he nam’d <i>Tucayan</i>,
of which his Companions report great matters; as first, of a certain River
call’d <i>Huex</i>, on the Banks whereof, in the space of twenty Leagues, or thereabouts,
there stand no less than fifteen good Burroughs, well built, and furnish’d likewise
with Stoves or Hot-houses, against the Cold, as in other Countreys of <i>Europe</i>; as
also of a very fruitful and pleasant Valley, which they therefore call’d <i>Aroba de Corazones</i>;
of another great Town and Territory, call’d <i>Chichilticala</i>; and lastly, of the
Valley of <i>Nuestra Sennora</i>, or <i>Our Ladies Dale</i>, in the South parts of the said Territory,
all of them describ’d for such rich and delicious Places, that some take them
for the <i>Campi Elisii</i> of <i>America</i>, especially seeing the <i>Spaniards</i> were never known to
visit them a second time, the Discoveries that have been made since being onely
of the North-West Parts of the Countrey, along the Coasts of <i>Mar Vermiglio</i>, and
this no farther than onely to give Name to certain Capes or Promontories which
they met with, as namely 1. <i>Porto de St. Clara</i>, near to the Mouth of the River
which they call <i>Rio del Nordt</i>. 2. <i>Las Playas.</i> 3. <i>St. Michael.</i> 4. <i>Lago del Oro</i>, which
bordereth on <i>Quivira</i>; and lastly, <i>El Rey Coronado</i>, Eastward of that.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Tontonteac.</i></div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span><i>Tontonteac</i> is mention’d by so few, and by those few so obscurely, that it cannot
well be determin’d to be any other than that Countrey which lies about
the great Lake <i>Tonteac</i>, above spoken of in <i>Cibola</i>, and which being made Habitable
by six or seven Towns not inconsiderable for Habitations of native <i>Indians</i>, might
haply pass for a distinct Province. And perhaps the reason why this Province hath
been so obscure, and little taken notice of, might be from the ruine of these Towns
by War, or some other Accident: and to this purpose are the words of a late Writer,
<i>The Province of</i> Tontonteac (saith he) <i>hath five Houses onely left, which stand on the
Shore of a salt Lake</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Nova Granada</i> a Province of <i>Northern America</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Nova Granada</i>, besides that it is a generally known and describ’d Province of
<i>Southern America</i>, is also nam’d amongst the Provinces of <i>Northern America</i>,
particularly by <i>Bertius</i>, <i>Cluverius</i>, and <i>Golnitzius</i>, and in some late Maps of <i>America</i> so
conspicuously specifi’d, that it might appear to be all that Tract of Land which
contains both <i>New Mexico</i> and the several Provinces adjoyning to it; but since we
find it not describ’d by any at large, it will with most verisimility pass for that
part of <i>New Mexico</i> where stands the City of <i>St. Foy</i>; and this is most plainly express’d
by Monsieur <i>Martini</i>, though there are who confound <i>Cibola</i> with <i>New Granada</i>. Waving
which Decision, we shall onely insert a short Description of the Place, according
to <i>Cornato</i>, who seems to have been one of the first Discoverers of these Parts,
and whose Credit is preferr’d before that of <i>Marcus de Niza</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its Description.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Nova Granada</i> (saith he) consists of seven Villages, built in the circumference of
four Leagues, the chiefest whereof boasts two hundred Houses, which for the most
part are four or five Stories high, and built of Stone; the Cellars thereto belonging,
being neatly Pav’d, serve for Stoves against the Cold: they ascend to their
upper Rooms by Ladders. The Inhabitants go naked, onely some Covering about
their Middle, and over their Shoulders Cotton Cloaks, painted with divers Colours.
They live on <i>Maiz</i>, white Pease, Hares, Rabbets, and Venison: their Salt
wherewith they season the same, they fetch from a neighboring Lake. The Turkies,
which they have in great numbers, are kill’d onely for their Feathers, notwithstanding
their Flesh is exceeding good Meat. The Soil is for the most part
plain, yet hath some high Mountains; and the Pastures flourish with Grass. The
Woods abound with Bears, Tygers, Lyons, wild Hogs, Rhinocerots, and the like
ravenous Beasts, which make the Ways dangerous for Travellers. Besides large
Deer, there are also Sheep, which in bigness may compare with Horses, having exceeding
great Horns, and little Tails.</p>

<p class='c010'>Concerning the abundance of <i>Turkoises</i>, of which <i>Niza</i> makes mention, <i>Cornato</i>
could give no certain account, because a little before his Arrival the <i>Granadians</i> had
convey’d their Children, which were under fifteen, and the aged People, who were
above sixty years of age, with their chiefest Goods, into remote places. However,
it is not unknown, that this Countrey affords <i>Turkoises</i>; for <i>Cornato</i> in his Journey
to <i>Quivira</i>, Besieg’d a City in these Parts near a great River; the Inhabitants
whereof, when they were not able to defend themselves any longer, throwing their
Cloaks, <i>Turkoises</i>, and other Riches into the Fire, Sallied out upon the <i>Spaniards</i>, and
died not altogether unreveng’d, as shall be specifi’d more at large in the Description
of <i>Tignes</i>, which being nam’d among the Towns of <i>Quivira</i>, will upon the comparing
of Circumstances, be apparently found to be the same with this.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, <i>New Granada</i> hath no Fruit-Trees, but little Cedars fit for Building.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 id='c301' class='c001'>CHAP. X.<br /> Quivira.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'><i>Quivira</i> is the next Region accounted of <i>California</i>, largely taken; yet appearing
by some Charts to lie so vastly remote, that all <i>New Mexico</i>, <i>Gallicia</i>,
and other Provinces already mention’d, lie between that and the Island.
And whereas <i>New Granada</i> is by several made a part of <i>New Mexico</i>; yet most certain
it is, that by some it is confounded with this Countrey, or at least accounted
a part thereof, as hereafter shall more plainly appear, according to the Account of
those that have most fully and particularly describ’d it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Situation of <i>Quivira</i>, and Description of the Inhabitants.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Quivira</i> takes up the most Northern and unknown part of <i>America</i> towards the
West, reaching as far as the supposed <i>Straight</i> of <i>Anian</i> aforesaid (if there be any
such) or else joyning to the Continent of <i>Tartary</i>. It is likewise the least fruitful
of all the <i>West-Indies</i>, especially for Corn. Cattel it hath good store, and Pasturage
indifferent good, the Countrey being for the most plain and level, and nothing
else but Pasturage. The Natives are few and salvage, living in Hoards or
great Companies together, after the manner of the <i>Tartars</i>, to whom they are
Neighbors, and (as it is not improbably thought) of their Race. The Men
Clothe themselves most commonly in that kind of Oxes Hide, elsewhere spoken of
under the Name of <i>Taurus Mexicanus</i>. The Women wear little else but their Hair,
notwithstanding the Countrey, especially for one half of the year, is excessive
cold. Their Cattel, though they are much less than the ordinary Kine of <i>Europe</i>,
are the chief Sustenance and Employment of the Natives; by Pasturing huge Herds
whereof from place to place, the People live, and maintain a Traffick with other
Parts. Yet some of them inhabit Towns, the chief whereof, as yet discover’d, seem
to be these which follow:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns of chief note.</div>

<p class='c010'>1. <i>Acus</i>, or <i>Acuco</i>, a small Town, but seated in a strong defensible place, and
being a great Staple for Cotton, the Territory about it hath been taken for a distinct
Province, and by some call’d <i>The Kingdom of Acuco</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Tignes</i>, a Town seated upon the Banks of a River bearing the same Name,
and inhabited, it seems, by a stout and resolute People, and whom the <i>Spaniards</i>,
coming amongst them in the Year 1540. had much ado to master: for they endur’d
a Siege for the space of six Weeks; and at last finding themselves so strongly begirt
by their Enemies, that there was no means to escape but by Death, or yielding up
themselves, rather than they would fall alive into their hands, they first buried and
spoil’d all such Treasure as they had (which were chiefly Saphires, and a few other
Gems, that the Countrey afforded) and after that setting on fire their Housholdstuff,
they took their Wives and Children with them, and made a desperate Sally
out upon the <i>Spaniards</i>; wherein although they were most of them slain, and trod
under the Horses Feet, or drown’d in passing the River, yet was it not without some
loss to the <i>Spaniards</i> themselves: nor would those few that were left behind deliver
up the Town, till it was fir’d about their Ears, and that they could no longer abide
in it. This Town, by all Circumstances, must needs be the same with that before
mention’d in <i>Nova Granada</i>, which makes good what we have said above, <i>viz.</i> That
<i>New Granada</i> is by some confounded with, or at least taken for a part of this Region.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>3. <i>Cicuic</i>, another small Town, four days Journey from <i>Tignes</i>. The Countrey
about this place, although generally it be all good Pasturage, and maintains abundance
of Cattel, yet is it so open and plain, that for almost a hundred Miles together,
the <i>Spaniards</i>, in their March hither from <i>New Spain</i>, found neither Stone nor
Tree, nor any thing else that could serve them for a Land-mark; so that they were
forc’d, as they march’d along, to raise up Heaps of Cow-dung, to serve them for
direction in their coming back, which was not long after: for not finding the Commodities
they sought for, and fearing to be surpris’d by Winter in those cold Countreys,
where they had no kind of accommodation, they made somewhat a hasty
Retreat, leaving behind them onely some few Religious Men, of the Order of
<i>St. Francis</i>, whose Endeavours to do the People good by Converting them to the
true Knowledge and Worship of Almighty God, procur’d them not long after, the
Crown of Martyrdom, being murder’d all of them, except one, by the Natives, and
he not without much difficulty escaping their Hands.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><i>Nova Albion.</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Nova Albion</i> was so denominated by Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>, when he was there Entertain’d
by the King of that Countrey; but whether it were in <i>Quivira</i> that he
was thus Entertain’d, and left that Denomination, or in the Island of <i>California</i>, appears
not either from the Relation, or from the common Consent of Cosmographers,
since some there are, who will have <i>Quivira</i> and <i>Nova Albion</i> to be one and the
same Province; others reckon it to be the utmost North-West part of <i>California</i>;
others make it distinct from <i>Quivira</i>, yet determine it not to the Island <i>California</i>,
seeming rather to make it an adjoyning Countrey to <i>Quivira</i>: wherefore finding
little else that concerns the Description of the Place, except the said Voyage of
<i>Drake</i>, we shall here set it down, and leave the farther Disquisition concerning the
Situation of the Place, till we come to describe the Island of <i>California</i> it self.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>’s Arrival there.</div>

<p class='c010'>Captain <i>Francis Drake</i> set Sail from <i>Plymouth</i> <i>Anno 1577.</i> and after much hardship
getting through the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>, arriv’d in the Haven <i>Guatulco</i>, having before
his coming thither taken as many rich <i>Spanish</i> Ships in the Southern Ocean as
he could possibly have wish’d for, so that his onely care now needed to have been
how to get safe home; yet he put on a Resolution, not to come short of <i>Ferdinandus
Magellanus</i>, who Saild about the World. Which brave Resolution of <i>Drake</i>’s was
approv’d of by all his Sea-men; whereupon he set Sail along the North of <i>California</i>
the fifth of <i>June</i>; being gotten into forty two Degrees, which was the farthest
that <i>Cabrillo</i> went, he came on a sudden out of a warm Air into so frigid a Climate,
that the Sea-men were almost kill’d with Cold, and the farther they went, the
colder it grew; wherefore falling down three Degrees more Southerly, they got
into a convenient Haven, where the Natives who liv’d along the Shore brought
them Presents; which <i>Drake</i> left not unrequited, by returning them others, that
were to them more novel, and not unuseful.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nature and Habit of the People.</div>

<p class='c010'>These People are exceeding hardy; for, notwithstanding the extraordinary coldness
of the Climate, the Men go naked; but the Women wear Garments of pleited
Flags or Rushes, which being put about their Middle, hang down to their Ancles;
on their Stomachs hang the ends of a hairy Skin ty’d together, which hanging also
over their Shoulders, cover their hinder Parts. They shew great Respect and
Obedience to their Husbands. Each House is surrounded with an Earthen Wall,
and all the Corners thereof being close stopp’d, and Fires made in the midst of
them, they are very warm. Rushes and Flags strow’d thick on the Ground near
the Walls, serve them in stead of Beds.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Indians</i> coming a second time to Visit the <i>English</i>, brought them Plumes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Feathers, Neckbands of Net-work, and store of Tobacco: <i>Drake</i> pleas’d with this
their kindness, built Tents on the Brow of a Hill, on the top of which the <i>Indians</i>
stood that brought the Presents, whil’st one of them with a loud voice maintain’d
a long Discourse; which he had no sooner ended, but every one laid down his Bowe
and Arrows, and walk’d unarm’d down to the Tents to proffer their Gifts: their
Wives staying behind on the top, pinch’d their Cheeks, and made sad lamentation;
which <i>Drake</i> suppos’d was because they made Offerings there: whereupon he also
caus’d all his Men to kneel down and say their Prayers, which made the <i>Indians</i> to
look very earnestly upon them, and to return him the Presents which the day before
they had receiv’d of him.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_343.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Drake</i>’s Entertainment by the King of the Countrey.</div>

<p class='c010'>The rumour of these Strangers arrival spreading all over the Countrey, made
the Inhabitants far and near desirous to see them; the King himself sending Ambassadors
to <i>Drake</i>, to inform him that he was on the Way coming to see him; all
which the Agents related at large, and desir’d some Presents, as a testimony that
their King should be welcome; which he being assur’d of, came with a Retinue of
above twelve thousand Men, before whom walk’d one of a Gygantick size, carrying
a costly Scepter, on which, by three long Chains made of Bones, hung a
great and a small Crown made of Feathers; next follow’d the King himself in a
Sute of Cony-Skins; then came a great confus’d company of People, each of them
carrying a Present: whereupon <i>Drake</i> putting his Men into good order, march’d
to meet the King; at which the Mace-bearer made a long Preamble, and when he
had done, Danc’d to the Tune of a Song, which he Sung himself; then the King
and his whole Retinue also fell a Singing and Dancing so long, till being weary
the King went to <i>Drake</i>, and humbly desir’d of him, that he would accept of the
Realm, assuring him, that all the People should be under his Obedience; which
said, he put the fore-mention’d Crown on his Head, and hanging three double
Chains about his Neck, call’d him <i>Hioh</i>: whereupon <i>Drake</i> took possession of the
Countrey in Queen <i>Elizabeths</i> Name. The King staying alone with <i>Drake</i>, his Retinue
went amongst the <i>English</i>, every one looking very earnestly upon them, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>to those whom they lik’d best, being the youngest, they falling down and crying,
proffer’d Offerings, as to Gods, and held their Cheeks to draw Blood out of them;
which the <i>English</i> refusing, they desisted; but shew’d them great Wounds, and desir’d
some Plaisters of them, which they suppli’d them with.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Monument erected by <i>Drake</i> before his departure.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>English</i> going up into the Countrey found the same well grown with Woods,
which abounded with Coneys, whose Heads differ’d little from the <i>European</i>, but
having Feet like Moles, long Tails like Rats, and in their Sides a Bag, wherein
when they had fill’d their Bellies they put the remainder. They also saw numerous
Herds of Deer, with whose Flesh having been courteously Entertain’d in several
Villages, they return’d to the Fleet. <i>Drake</i>, just before he weighed Anchor, caus’d
a pillar to be set in the Ground with a Silver Plate on the same, with an Inscription,
mentioning the Day of his Arrival, Name and Arms of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, and
free delivering of that Realm to him by the <i>Indians</i>: he also nail’d a Sixpence with
the Queens Effigies on the Plate, under which he caus’d his own Name to be
Engraven.</p>

Having treated at large of all the several Regions and Provinces
of the North part of the Continent of <i>America</i>, we
come now to those Islands that lie within the same Degrees
of Northern Latitude with that part of the Continent:
The first is <i>Terre Neuve</i>, or <i>New-found</i> Land, discover’d
together with several other Parts upon the Continent
before mention’d by Sir <i>Sebastian Cabott</i>, by the Countenance
and Charge of King <i>Henry</i> the Seventh of <i>England</i>;
whereupon a rightful Claim thereunto, and Interest therein, hath been own’d by
the succeeding Kings of <i>England</i>, as hereafter shall be more particularly related.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Bounds of <i>New-found Land</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>New-found Land</i> is situated betwixt the Degrees of forty six and fifty three of
Northern Latitude, and is divided from the Continent of <i>America</i> by an Arm of
the Sea, in like distance as <i>England</i> is from <i>France</i>. The Island is as large as <i>England</i>
in length, greater in breadth, and lies near the Course that Ships usually hold in
their Return from the <i>West-Indies</i>, and is near the mid-way between <i>Ireland</i> and
<i>Virginia</i>.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Temperature.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>We shall not much need to commend the wholsom temperature of this Countrey,
seeing the greatest part thereof lieth above three Degrees nearer to the South,
than any part of <i>England</i> doth, so that even in the Winter it is pleasant and healthful
as <i>England</i> is.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nature of the Inhabitants.</div>

<p class='c010'>The natural Inhabitants of the Countrey, as they are but few in number, so are
they something a rude and salvage People, having neither knowledge of God, nor
living under any kind of Civil Government. In their Habits, Customs, and Manners,
they resemble the <i>Indians</i> of the Continent, from whence it is to be suppos’d
they come; they live altogether in the North and West part of the Countrey, which
is seldom frequented by the <i>English</i>; but the <i>French</i> and <i>Biscainers</i> (who resort thither
yearly for the Whale-fishing, and also for the Cod-fish) report them to be an ingenuous
and tractable People (being well us’d) and very ready to assist them with
great labour and patience, in the killing, cutting, and boyling of Whales, and making
the Trayn-Oyl, without expectation of other Reward than a little Bread, or
some such small Hire.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Commodious Harbors.</div>

<p class='c010'>It hath the most commodious Harbours in the World, and the most safe Seas to
Sail to it, there being not any Islands, Rocks or Sands between the <i>Lands-End</i> in <i>England</i>
and <i>New-found Land</i>, and for the most part it is not above three or four Weeks Sail
thither, and less coming back; and is the most commodiously situated for the discovering
of the North-West Passage, and other Inlets into the South Sea; whereby
the ordinary Voyages to <i>China</i>, <i>Japan</i>, and the <i>East-Indies</i>, are much eas’d in the expence
of Time and Charge; and the most open to Trade to all Parts, of any Island
of the <i>West-Indies</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the East side of the Land, are the Bays of <i>Trinity</i> and <i>Conception</i>, which stretch
themselves towards the South-West.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Tor-Bay</i> and <i>Capelin-Bay</i> lying also on the East, stretch themselves towards the
West.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Bays of <i>Trespassey</i>, <i>St. Mary</i>, <i>Borrel</i>, and <i>Plaisance</i>, on the South part of the
Land, extend their Arms towards the North.</p>

<p class='c010'>The great Bay of <i>St. Peters</i> lying on the South-West side of the Land, and Southerly
from the great River of <i>Canada</i>, being about twenty Leagues distant, the same
stretcheth toward the East.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Trinity</i> Harbour lies in near forty nine Degrees of North Latitude, being very
commodiously seated to receive Shipping in seasonable Weather, both to Anchor in,
and from thence to Sail towards either the East, West, or South. It hath three Arms
or Rivers, long and large enough for many hundred Sail of Ships to moare fast at
Anchor near a Mile from the Harbours Mouth. Close adjoyning to the Rivers
side, and within the Harbour, is much open Land, well stor’d with Grass sufficient,
Winter and Summer, to maintain great store of ordinary Cattel, besides Hogs
and Goats, if such Beasts were carried thither; and it standeth North most of any
Harbor in the Land, where our Nation practiseth Fishing: It is near unto a great
Bay lying on the North side of it, call’d <i>The Bay of Flowers</i>; to which Place no
Ships repair to Fish, in regard of sundry Rocks and Ledges lying even with the Water,
and full of danger.</p>

<p class='c010'>The bottom of the Bay of <i>Trinity</i> lieth within four Leagues through the Land
South-West, Southerly from <i>Trinity</i>, as by experience is found; and it comes near
unto the Bay of <i>Trespassey</i>, and the bottom of some other Bays.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Trespassey</i> in like manner is as commodious a Harbour, lying in a more temperate
Climate, almost in forty six Degrees of North Latitude, and is both fair and pleasant,
and a wholsom Coast free from Rocks and Shelves; so that of all other Harbours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>it lies the most South of any in the Land, and most conveniently to receive
our Shipping, passing to and from <i>Virginia</i> and the <i>Bermuda</i> Islands; and also any
other Shipping that shall pass to and from the River of <i>Canada</i>, and the Coast thereof,
because they usually pass, and so return in the sight of the Land of <i>Trespassey</i>,
and also for some other purposes, as shall be partly declar’d in the following
Discourse.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fruitful Soil.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Soil of this Countrey in the Valleys and sides of the Mountains is so fruitful,
as that in divers places the Summer naturally produceth without Tillage, great
plenty of green Pease, and Fitches, fair, round, full, and as wholsom as ours in
<i>England</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Berries and Fruits.</div>

<p class='c010'>Of Berries and Fruits, there grows Strawberries, red and white, and as fair
Raspice-berries and Goose-berries as there be in <i>England</i>; as also Bilberries, which
are call’d by some <i>Whortes</i>, and many other delicate Berries peculiar to the Countrey,
in great abundance. Likewise small Pears, Cherries, Filberds, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Herbs and Flowers.</div>

<p class='c010'>There are also Herbs for Sallets and Broth, as Parsly, Alexander, Sorrel, <i>&amp;c.</i> and
also Flowers, as the red and white Damask Rose, with other kinds, which are most
beautiful and delightful, both to the sight and smell. And questionless, the Countrey
is stor’d with many Physical Herbs, though their Vertues are not known.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Corn was first Sow’n here, it was observ’d to grow very fair, the increase
was great, and the Grain very good; and several sorts of Kitchin Plants that have
been Set here, have prov’d very well.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Beasts.</div>

<p class='c010'>In divers parts of the Countrey there is great store of Deer, and some Hares, many
Foxes, Squerrils, Beavers, Martins and Otters, yielding excellent Furrs, Wolves
and Bears, with other sorts of Beasts, serving as well for Necessity, as for Profit
and Delight.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Birds.</div>

<p class='c010'>Variety both of Land and Water-Fowl is in this Countrey infinite: The chief
Land-Fowl, besides a great number of small Birds, that live by scraping their Food
from the Earth in the hardest Winter, are Hawks, great and small Partridges, Thrush,
and Thrussels abundance, very fat; as also Filladies, Nightingales, and such like,
which sing most pleasantly. There are also Birds that live by prey, as Ravens,
Gripes, Crows, <i>&amp;c.</i> For Water-Fowl, there is certainly so good, and as much
variety, as in any part of the World, as Geese, Ducks, Pigeons, Gulls, Penguins,
and many other sorts. These Penguins are as big as Geese, but do not flye, for
they have but a little short Wing; and they multiply so infinitely upon a certain
flat Island, that men drive them from thence upon a Board into their Boats by
hundreds at a time, as if God had made the innocency of so poor a Creature to become
such an admirable Instrument for the sustentation of Man: And also Godwits,
Curlews, and such like; which Fowl do not onely serve those that Trade
thither for Food, but also they are a great furthering to divers Ships Voyages, because
the abundance of them is such, that the Fisher-men do bait their Hooks with
the quarters of Sea-Fowl on them; and therewith some Ships do yearly take a great
part of their Fishing Voyages with such Bait, before they can get others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Springs.</div>

<p class='c010'>The fresh Waters and Springs of that Countrey are many in number, and withall
so very pleasant, delightful and wholsom, that no Countrey in the World hath
better: And Fewel for Fireing, no where more plentiful.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Trees.</div>

<p class='c010'>In like manner there is great abundance of Trees fit to be employ’d in other serviceable
uses: There are Fir and Spruce-Trees, sound, good, and fit to Mast Ships
with, and as commodious for Boards and Buildings as those of <i>Norway</i>; and out
of these come abundance of Turpentine. Moreover the Pine and Birch-Trees here
are scarce to be compar’d for heighth and greatness.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>The Rivers also and Harbours are generally stor’d with delicate Fish, as Salmons,
Peals, Eels, Herrings, Mackrel, Flounders, Launce, Capelin, Cod, and Trouts,
the fairest, fattest and sweetest, that ever were seen in these Parts. The like for
Lobsters, Cra-fish, Mussles, and other variety of Shell-fish.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Seas likewise all along the Coast, do plentifully abound in other sorts of
Fish, as Whales, <i>Spanish</i> Mackrel, Dorrel, Pales, Herrings, Hogs, Porposes, Seals,
and such like Royal Fish, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>But the chief Commodity of <i>New found Land</i> yet known, and which is grown to
be a setled Trade, and that it may be much better’d by an ordinary Plantation there,
(if the Traders thither will take some better course than formerly they have done,
as shall be declared) is the Cod-fishing upon that Coast, by which our Nation and
many other Countreys are enrich’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>Almost incredible is the benefit of the Fish, which the <i>French</i>, <i>Biscainers</i>, and
<i>Portuguese</i> fetch yearly from this Coast of <i>New-found Land</i>, and the <i>Bank</i>, which
lieth within twenty five Leagues from the South Cape of that Countrey, where the
<i>French</i> use to Fish Winter and Summer, usually making two Voyages every year
thither. To which Places, and to the Coast of <i>Canada</i>, which lieth near unto it,
are yearly sent from those Countreys, more than four hundred Sail of Ships.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Island of <i>Terra Nova</i> belongs properly and justly to the Crown of <i>England</i>,
having been under the sole Jurisdiction of the <i>English</i> from the first Discovery thereof,
which was by Sir <i>Sebastian Cabot</i>, Employ’d by King <i>Henry</i> the Seventh, to find
out some other part of <i>America</i>, than what had been discover’d by <i>Columbus</i>, as hath
been above declar’d in several places.</p>

<p class='c010'>Afterwards King <i>Henry</i> the Eighth continu’d the <i>English</i> Interest there, and
Employ’d one <i>Rutt</i> into that Island, in order to the Plantation thereof.</p>

<p class='c010'>Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> no less careful to preserve that Plantation, sent Sir <i>Humphrey
Gilbert</i>, a <i>Devonshire</i> Knight, to plant a Colony there, the better to secure the same,
and to increase Trading there; and accordingly the said Sir <i>Humphrey</i> with two
good Ships and a Pinnace in her Name, took possession of that Countrey, in the
Harbour of <i>St. Johns</i>. He Sail’d from thence towards <i>Virginia</i>, and by reason of
some unhappy direction in his Course, the greatest Ship he had struck upon Shelves
on the Coast of <i>Canada</i>, and was there lost, with most part of the Company in her;
and he himself, being then in a small Pinnace of twenty Tun, in the company of
his Vice-Admiral (Captain <i>Hays</i>) returning towards <i>England</i>, in a great Storm, was
overwhelm’d in the Sea, and so perish’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1608. it was undertaken anew by <i>John Guy</i>, a Merchant of <i>Bristol</i>,
and with so good success, that the Colony in a short time were well furnish’d with
Wheat, Rye, Barley, and other Grain of their own Sowing, with Turnips, Coleworts,
and abundance of other necessary things, not without some probable hopes
of Metals, a certain and plentiful Trade of Sables, Musk, and other rich Commodities.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Province of <i>Avalon</i> in <i>New-found Land</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1620. Sir <i>George Calvert</i> Knight, then principal Secretary of State,
and a Privy Councellor to King <i>James</i> the First of <i>England</i>, &amp;c. purchas’d a part of
<i>New-found Land</i>, which was afterwards in the Year 1623. granted to him and his
Heirs by Patent from the said King, under the Great Seal of <i>England</i>, bearing Date
the seventh of <i>April</i>, in the One and twentieth Year of his Reign: by which means
the said Tract of Land was erected into a Province, and at the Instance of the said
Sir <i>George Calvert</i>, call’d <i>Avalon</i>, from <i>Avalon</i> in <i>Sommerset-shire</i>, where <i>Christianity</i> was
first Planted in England.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Province lies in the forty seventh Degree of Northern Latitude, and is thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>bounded: It begins Southerly from the middle part of a certain Neck of Land or
Promontory, situate between the two Harbours, <i>Fermose</i> and <i>Aquafort</i>; and from
thence following the Shore towards the North unto the middle part, or half way
over a little Harbour, call’d in that regard <i>Petit Port</i>, or <i>Petit Harbour</i>, which boundeth
upon the South part of the Plantation of <i>St. Johns</i>, including the one half of a
certain fresh River, that falleth into the said Port of <i>Petit Harbour</i>; and so tending
along the South Border of the said Colony of <i>St. Johns</i>, extendeth it self to a certain
little Bay, commonly call’d <i>Salmon Cove</i>, lying on the South side of the Bay of
<i>Conception</i>, including the one half of the River that falleth into the said <i>Cove</i>, as also
one half of the <i>Cove</i> it self; from whence passing along the Shore of the said Bay
towards the South, and reaching unto the bottom thereof, where it meets with
the Lands of the fore-mention’d <i>John Guy</i>, nam’d <i>Sea-Forrest</i>, is bounded with a certain
River or Brook, which there falleth into the Sea, and from the Mouth of the
said Brook ascendeth unto the farthest Spring or Head thereof; from thence passing
towards the South for six Miles together along the Borders of the said <i>John Guy</i>’s
Plantation, and there crossing over Westward in a right Line, reacheth unto the
Bay of <i>Placentia</i>, and the space of one League within the said Bay from the Shore
thereof; whence turning again towards the South, passeth along the Harbour of
<i>Placentia</i>, with the like distance from the Shore, and descending unto <i>New Falkland</i>
towards the North and West part thereof, stretcheth it self in a right Line Eastward,
continuing the whole Southerly length upon the Bounds of the said <i>New
Falkland</i>, unto the middle part or Point of the Promontory, or Neck of Land before
mention’d, between the Ports <i>Fermose</i> and <i>Aquafort</i>; at which place is describ’d
and finish’d the Perambulation of the whole Precinct, whose Extent may be thus
computed, commencing from the Promontory between the Ports <i>Fermose</i> and <i>Aquafort</i>,
which is fifty or sixty Miles from South to North distant from <i>Petit Harbour</i>;
from whence crossing Westward to the Bay of <i>Placentia</i>, is judg’d to be sixty Miles
more or upwards, from East to West.</p>

<p class='c010'>And thereby was also granted to the said Sir <i>George Calvert</i> and his Heirs, all
Islands and Islets, within ten Leagues of the Eastern Shore of the said Region towards
the East, together with the Fishing of all sorts of Fish, saving unto the <i>English</i>
free liberty of Fishing, as well in the Seas as in the Ports and Creeks of the Province
aforesaid, and the Priviledges of salting and drying their Fish upon the Shores of
the said Province, as heretofore they reasonably us’d and enjoy’d the same, so as they
do no injury or notable loss or detriment unto the Lord Proprietary, his Heirs and
Assigns, or to the Inhabitants of the said Province, in the Ports, Creeks, and Shores
aforesaid, and especially in the Woods growing within the said Province.</p>

<p class='c010'>And by the said Patent all Royal Jurisdictions and Prerogatives, both Military
and Civil, within the said Province and Islands thereunto belonging, were farther
granted to the said Sir <i>George Calvert</i> and his Heirs, and he and they thereby created
the true and absolute Lords and Proprietaries of the said Province, saving the Allegiance
due to His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, to be held of them in <i>Capite</i>,
yielding and paying unto them therefore a white Horse, when, and as often as any
of them shall come into the said Province, and the fifth part of all Gold and Silver
Oar which should be found there.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sir <i>George Calvert</i>, before the obtaining of this Patent, had caus’d a fair House
and Fort to be built in the said Province, at a place call’d <i>Ferryland</i>, and in the Year
1624. having obtain’d a Dismission from his Employment of Secretary of State,
and being then created Lord <i>Baltemore</i> of <i>Baltemore</i> in <i>Ireland</i>, he did in the Year
1627. Transport himself to <i>Avalon</i>, to inspect his Concerns there in Person; from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>whence returning the same year, he Embarqu’d himself again, together with his Lady
and all his Family, except his eldest Son, for <i>Avalon</i> the year following; at which
time (there being then War between <i>England</i> and <i>France</i>) he redeem’d above twenty
Sail of <i>English</i> Ships, which had been taken there that year by <i>French</i> Men of War,
whereof one Monsieur <i>De la Rade</i> had the chief Command, and shortly after took
six <i>French</i> Fishing-Ships upon that Coast, and sent them the same year, with a great
many <i>French</i>-men Prisoners, into <i>England</i>. Coming thence, he left a Deputy there,
and continu’d the Plantation till his Death, which was in <i>April 1632.</i> After whose
Decease it descended of right to his Son and Heir <i>Cecil</i>, now Lord <i>Baltemore</i>; who
thereupon sent one Captain <i>William Hill</i> as his Deputy thither, to take possession
thereof, and to manage his Interest there for him. Captain <i>Hill</i>, according to his
Commission, shortly after repair’d thither, and liv’d some years at the Lord <i>Baltemore</i>’s
House at <i>Ferryland</i> above mention’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the thirteenth Year of King <i>Charles</i> the First, of <i>England</i>, &amp;c. about the Year
of our Lord 1638. Marquess <i>Hamilton</i>, Earl of <i>Pembroke</i>, Sir <i>David Kirk</i>, and others,
under pretence that the Lord <i>Baltemore</i> had deserted that Plantation, obtain’d a
Patent of all <i>New-found Land</i>, wherein <i>Avalon</i> was included, and shortly after dispossess’d
the Lord <i>Baltemore</i> of his Mansion House in <i>Ferryland</i>, and other Rights
there, and during the late Rebellion in <i>England</i> kept possession; but His now Majesty
King <i>Charles</i> the Second, immediately after his most happy Restauration in
the Year 1660, upon the now Lord <i>Baltemore</i>’s Petition, thought fit to refer the
whole Matter to be Examin’d by Sir <i>Orlando Bridgeman</i>, then Lord-Chief-Justice,
now Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of <i>England</i>, and others, to report the true state
thereof to His Majesty, together with their Opinions thereupon: The Referrees
accordingly, upon full hearing of Council on both sides, certifi’d, That they conceiv’d
the said Patent to Sir <i>George Calvert</i>, to be a good Patent, in force, and not
avoided by the later to Sir <i>David Kirk</i> and others; and that the Title and Interest
to the said Province did therefore belong to the Lord <i>Baltemore</i>. Whereupon His
Majesty, on the twentieth of <i>March</i> in the same Year, Order’d the Possession thereof
to be re-deliver’d to his Lordship, which was accordingly executed: Since which
time his Lordship has peaceably enjoy’d the possession thereof, and continues the
Plantation to this day, by deputing Lieutenants there from time to time, for the
better Government of that Province, the rest of <i>New-found Land</i> remaining still to
the aforesaid Proprietors, claiming by the Patent of 13 <i>Car.</i> 1.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Commodities that are either by Art or Nature produc’d there, are the same
with those of the remainder of <i>New-found Land</i>. The Winter there is extream cold,
the Summer very hot, but withal pleasant; and during that Season there is great
plenty of Pasture for Cattel.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Coast of this Province is very safe, and as well furnish’d with variety of
bold and pleasant Harbors, as any other part of <i>New-found Land</i>; where the <i>English</i>
likewise Fish for Cod, the lesser sort whereof is call’d <i>Poor-John</i>, which is there
caught in great abundance, especially at <i>Ferryland</i>, and in the <i>Bay of Bulls</i>. Besides
these two there are divers other excellent Harbors on the Eastern Shore of <i>Avalon</i>,
as <i>Capling Bay</i>, <i>Cape Broyle</i>, <i>Brittus</i>, <i>Isle of Spears</i>, <i>Barrom Cove</i>, <i>Whitburns Bay</i>, and <i>Petit
Harbour</i> above mention’d. On the West are the Bay of <i>Placentia</i>, and several other
good Harbors.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are no <i>Indians</i> in <i>Avalon</i>, and but few <i>English</i>, by reason of the excessive
Cold in Winter, though Sir <i>David Kirk</i> and his Lady, and also his Family, liv’d in
the Lord <i>Baltemore</i>’s House at <i>Ferryland</i> for the space of ten years and upwards.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Soil seems to promise great store of Mines, which probably may in time be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>discover’d. The late Lord <i>Baltemore</i> took accidentally a piece of Oar up that lay
there upon the surface of the Earth, and brought it with him into <i>England</i>, which
was found upon trial to yield a greater proportion of Silver, than the Oar of <i>Potosi</i>
in the <i>West-Indies</i>, but hitherto no Mine of it hath been discover’d there.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Trade of Fishing being of so great concernment to the Nation of <i>England</i>,
the same (if it be well manag’d in this Island of <i>Terra Nova</i>) will employ every
year above two hundred Sail of <i>English</i> Ships, and ten thousand Mariners, besides
the great benefit which may accrue unto the Nation by Imposition upon Strangers
there, which would amount to several thousands of Pounds <i>per Annum</i>; with which
those Coasts may be Guarded, and Ships Trading thither secur’d: besides the great
Customs by the Ships call’d <i>The Sacks</i> (being commonly in great numbers every
year) who carry Fish from <i>New-found Land</i> into the <i>Straights</i>, <i>France</i>, <i>Portugal</i>, and
<i>Spain</i>, and who bring their Returns into <i>England</i>, as Bullion, and all other native
Commodities of those Countreys.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the Island were well fortifi’d, we might Command all those of other Nations
that come to Fish in <i>New-found Land</i>, to pay Contribution in Fish or otherwise, for
their Priviledge to Fish there, the said Island being first Planted by <i>English</i>, and pertaining
to the Kingdom of <i>England</i>; or if occasion should require, they might be
utterly debarr’d of Fishing there.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Trade of Fishing is of so great concernment to <i>France</i>, <i>Spain</i>, <i>Portugal</i>, the
<i>Straights</i>, and other Parts, that they cannot well be without that yearly Supply
in Fish which comes from that Island: Neither can the <i>Hollanders</i>, <i>Spaniards</i>, or
<i>Portuguese</i>, well set any Ships to the <i>West-Indies</i>, without <i>New-found Land</i> Fish, there
being none that will endure to pass the Line sound and untainted, but the Fish of
that Countrey, salted and dry’d there. And so long as the Act continues still in
force, That no Fish be Transported from the said Island, but in <i>English</i> Bottoms, it
will contribute very much to our encrease of Shipping there, and by consequence,
of the employment of Mariners; and the Fishing of that part of the Island will
be solely appropriated to the <i>English</i> Nation, to whom of right it belongs, which
will prove the greatest Ballance of Trade in that part of the World; and
that whereas above two hundred Sail do Trade thither yearly to Fish, if a
thousand Sail come, if there be but Fisher-men enow, they may all have Fraughtage
there.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>French</i>, if once the Island be fortifi’d, will be depriv’d of their Nursery of
Mariners, this being the onely place, besides <i>Canada</i>, and one or two adjacent Coasts,
where they come for supply of Fish, with which that Nation cannot be furnish’d
so well from other Parts.</p>

<p class='c010'>By well Planting and Fortifying <i>New-found Land</i>, the Trading to <i>Virginia</i>, <i>New
England</i>, and those Parts, would be much encourag’d, <i>New England</i> having had of
late great Traffick with <i>New-found Land</i>, where they vend the Growth of their
Plantation. Besides, <i>New-found Land</i> is a Key to the Gulf of <i>Canada</i>, which if the
<i>English</i> had again in their possession, as they had in the Years 1628. and 1632. they
might give a Law to all foreign Kings and People interested in any of the parts of
<i>America</i>, and a Protection to all the <i>English</i> Plantations upon that Continent, whereby
great security, comfort and profit would arise to the Nation and People of it:
whereas on the contrary, if the <i>French</i>, <i>Spanish</i>, or <i>Dutch</i>, should possess themselves
of the said Plantation, they would not onely deprive this Nation of all the Advantages
aforesaid, but would also derive to themselves so great a Power to prejudice
all the Plantations of the Coasts of <i>America</i> belonging to this Nation, that the
Inconveniences thereof are scarce to be imagin’d or express’d.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>After the granting of the Patent aforesaid of 13 <i>Car.</i> 1. Sir <i>David Kirk</i>’s great
Pains there, and constant Endeavours, were beyond expectation bless’d with a continuance
and preservation of Trade in that Place; in the carrying on of which, he
had always a special regard to the real Advantage of this Kingdom, and the particular
Service of His Majesty.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The wonderful Bank of <i>Terra Nova</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Baccaloos.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Before this Island, right over against <i>Cape Ray</i>, at the distance of twenty four
Leagues or more, there lieth an huge Bank or Ridge of Land, extending it self in
length out of the Sea, above a hundred Leagues, but in breadth not above four or
five and twenty, when it is broadest, and in other parts much less, sharpning towards
each end into a <i>Conus</i>, or narrow Point. It is accounted one of the Wonders
of the Sea, which round about, at some distance, is very deep, and hardly to be
sounded, especially betwixt the <i>Bank</i> (for so they commonly call it) and <i>Cape Ray</i>,
but drawing nearer, it grows by degrees more and more shallow, insomuch that
nigh the Land there is not much more Water than is necessary for the Ships to Ride
in. It runneth out in length, as was said, from North to South, from forty one
Degrees of Latitude to fifty two; and round about it there lie scatter’d a multitude
of lesser Islands, which Sir <i>Sebastian Cabot</i>, when he first discover’d the Place, call’d
by one common Name <i>Los Baccaloos</i>, or <i>The Islands of Cod-fish</i>, from the great quantity
of that sort of Fish he there found; which was such, that they hindred the passage
of his Ships, and lay in such multitudes upon the Coasts, that the very Bears
would come and catch them in their Claws, and draw them to Land.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>In the Gulf of <i>St. Laurence</i>, towards the Mouth of the River <i>Canada</i>, is another
less considerable Island, said to have been first discover’d by <i>Quartier</i>, and by
him call’d <i>The Island of Assumption</i>; by <i>John Alphonso</i>, <i>The Island of Ascension</i>; by the
Natives, <i>Natistcotec</i>: It extends it self from the forty eighth to the fiftieth Degree,
between the South-East and North-West.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Quartier</i> makes mention of a strange kinde of Fish, found in the River of <i>Canada</i>,
like unto a Sea-Hog, but having the Head of a Hare, it is call’d by the Natives
<i>Adhothuys</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not far from this is a little Island, call’d by the <i>French</i>, <i>Isle de Sable</i>, or <i>The Sandy
Island</i>; and another on the West of <i>Terra Nova</i>, call’d <i>Isle de Bretons</i>, or <i>The Island
of St. Laurence</i>, besides several little scatter’d Islands in the Gulf of <i>St. Laurence</i>, as
<i>Menego</i>, and <i>The Three Islands of Birds</i>; in which are found a kind of amphibious
Animal, call’d by the <i>French</i>, <i>Cualrus</i>, and by the <i>Russians</i>, <i>Morsh</i>; somewhat like a
Sea-Calf, but more monstrous.</p>

about sixteen hundred Leagues from <i>England</i>, twelve hundred from <i>Madera</i>, four
hundred from <i>Hispaniola</i>, and three hundred from the nearest Coast of <i>Virginia</i>.
The first that endeavour’d to settle Plantations here was a <i>Spaniard</i> nam’d <i>Hernando
Camelo</i>, being design’d Conductor in this Expedition: And this Undertaking was
so much the more eagerly prosecuted, upon consideration that the Plate-Fleet
Sailing from <i>Havana</i> through the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Bahama</i>, might here have a convenient
Harbour; but those who were invited to become Adventurers, with proffers
of great Advantage, shewing themselves very slack in the Business, and <i>Charles</i> the
Fifth being at that time intangled in War and other troublesom Affairs, the Design
came to nothing, and for above sixty years after no farther Attempt was made by
any for the Planting of these Islands, till at last the <i>French</i> made a Voyage thither
under Captain <i>Barboriere</i>, but by Shipwrack were frustrated of their hopes; nor made
they any more Preparations in this Design. In which nevertheless the <i>English</i>
were not so easily discourag’d, for first Captain <i>Gosnol</i> and <i>Smith</i> set forth, at the
Charges of Mr. <i>Edward Wingfield</i>; next, Captain <i>Nelson</i>; then successively <i>West</i>,
<i>Gates</i>, <i>Argal</i>, and <i>Wyat</i>, but all with little or no success, till at length in the Year
1612. a Company was establish’d in <i>London</i> by the King’s Letters Patents, who sent
one Mr. <i>Richard Moor</i> with sixty Men to the <i>Bermudas</i>, where he spent three years
in fortifying those Islands: but that which put a little stop to this good beginning,
was a kind of Misfortune that hapned; for the Rats which were gotten ashore from
a Shipwrack increas’d so exceedingly, that they devour’d all the Plants in the Field,
and the Provision in the Houses, insomuch that a great Famine proceeded from
thence, all means to destroy the Vermine being in vain; till at last Providence sent
a Disease amongst them, which kill’d them all in a very short time. Mean while
<i>Moor</i> went on in the fortification of the Island, and was ere long supply’d with fresh
People. Mr. <i>Barlet</i> was sent over with sixty Men, and carried from thence with
him eighty Pound of Ambergreece. And soon after three Ships more, <i>viz.</i> the
<i>Blessing</i>, the <i>Star</i>, and the <i>Margaret</i>, convey’d thither four hundred and ten, Men and
Women. As soon as <i>Moor</i> was call’d away, <i>Daniel Tuckard</i> coming from <i>Virginia</i> to
succeed him, bestirr’d himself very much, Planting all places full of Trees fetch’d
from the <i>West-Indian</i> Islands; as also Tobacco, with which he fraighted a Ship to
<i>London</i>. Moreover, the Countrey was divided into Acres, that every Planter might
have an equal share, and know his own Lands. <i>Anno 1619.</i> <i>Tuckard</i> was succceded
by <i>Nathaniel Butler</i>, who in four Ships brought thither five hundred Men and Women,
to supply the first Plantation, which was much decay’d since the Rats had
devour’d their Provisions, so that it was little look’d after by the Company in <i>London</i>:
But now they built a Church and erected a Court of Judicature, and all
things were order’d conveniently for the publick good. After which many Noble
Persons set Sail thither in the <i>Magazine</i> Frigat; and the Planters being now fifteen
hundred in number, inhabited twenty Leagues of Land in length.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Forts built upon the <i>Bermudas</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>On the longest Island, call’d <i>St. George</i>, (for the <i>Bermudas</i> consists of several
Islands, great and small) they built <i>Warwick</i> and <i>Dover</i> Forts, with other Fortifications
and Towers, which had their Denominations from those Noble-men and
Gentlemen that were Undertakers in this Plantation, as <i>Cavendish</i>, <i>Paget</i>, <i>Herbert</i>, &amp;c.
from the Earl of <i>Devonshire</i>, the Lord <i>Paget</i>, the Earl of <i>Pembroke</i> and others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ports and Havens.</div>

<p class='c010'>Amongst the Havens the eminentest are, <i>Southampton</i>, the Inlet <i>Harrington</i>, and
the <i>Great Sound</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>All these Islands lying together resemble a Half-Moon, and are surrounded with
Rocks, which appear at Low-water, and at High lie but shallow; for it seldom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>Ebbs or Flows above five Foot. The Shore, for the most part Rocky, and hardned
by the Sun and Wind, receives no damage by the Waves which continually beat
against the same.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nature of the Soil.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Ground it self differs; for in some places it is sandy or clayie, and in
others partly black, and partly white, or Ash-colour’d Earth; which last is accounted
the worst, and the black the best. Three Foot deep under the Ash-colour’d
Earth lie great Slates, and under the black, a white spungie Stone, like the Pumice,
in whose moist Crevises Trees take root.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Pits or Wells, though they Ebb and Flow with the Sea, yet produce a
wholsom and sweet Water.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Temperature of the Air.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Skie is generally serene, but when over-cast with Clouds, is subject to Lightning
and Thunder; yet the Air is of a good temper, being neither exceeding cold,
nor excessive hot: for which reason the <i>European</i> Fruits grow better there than in
their natural Soil.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Harvest is twice a year; for that which they Sowe in <i>March</i>, is ripe and
gather’d in <i>June</i>; then what they Sowe again in <i>August</i>, they gather in <i>January</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Productions of the Countrey.</div>

<p class='c010'>These Islands breed no hurtful Creatures; nay, the yellow Spider which spins
silken Cobwebs, is free from Poyson.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Plant <i>Nuchtly</i>, which bears speckled Pears, grows betwixt the Rocks which
are drench’d with Sea-water.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Hogs which above a hundred and fifty years since swam ashore out of the
<i>Spanish</i> Wrack, are exceedingly increas’d there, but because of their poorness are
scarce eatable, they feeding onely on the sweet Berries which fall from the <i>Palmito</i>-Trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the white and red Mulberries, which grow plentifully there, breed
thousands of Silk-worms, which spin Silk according to the colour of the Mulberries.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Sea produces some quantity of Pearls and Ambergreece.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the beginning of the year till <i>May</i>, the Whales are seen to swim not far
from the Shore.</p>

<p class='c010'>A strange sort of Sea-Fowl breed in Holes like Rabbets; and amongst other
Birds, here are also store of Cranes.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Tobacco which the <i>English</i> have planted here grows very well.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Tortoises Laying of Eggs.</div>

<p class='c010'>Here are likewise great Tortoises, which Lay their Eggs in the Sand on the
Shore, where they are Hatch’d by the Beams of the Sun, and are taken after this
manner: In the Night some are set to watch where they Land, and whilest they
are digging a deep Hole in the Ground, are thrown on their Backs, and not being
able to get upon their Legs again, they lie and groan very pitifully: some of them
having above two Basons full of Eggs in their Bellies; which being about the bigness
of a Tennis-Ball, have a thin Shell, which incloseth a Yolk and White. If these
Eggs lie buried six years, then the young Tortoises breaking the Shell, come out of
the Sand, and instantly creep into the Sea. Their Flesh is not onely wholsom but
toothsom. The Oyl made of them is not inferior to Butter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cedars of an excellent kind.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, the <i>Bermudas</i> produce Cedars, the like of which are not to be found in
the whole World: The Leaves are douny and prickly at the ends, almost like those
of the Juniper Tree: The Wood hath a sweet smell, and the Berries, which are like
the Myrtle, of a pale Red, inclose four white Kernels; the outermost Skin whereof
is sweet; the innermost, which covers the Kernel, sharp, and the Pulp tartish:
The Trees are always flourishing, being at the same time full of Blossoms, green,
and ripe Fruit: The Berries, when grown ripe, begin to gape, and fall off in rainy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>Weather, leaving a round Stalk on the Boughs, which loses not its Rind till two
years after; half which time the Berry requires, before it attains to its perfect ripeness,
which generally happens in the Winter: The Boughs shoot straight upwards,
and become in time so heavy, that they cause the Body of the Tree to bend. This
most excellent Wood grows in divers places of the <i>Bermudas</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>We shall conclude with the resolute Exploit of five Sea-men, <i>Anno 1616.</i> who, to
the great admiration of all People, set Sail from thence in an open Vessel of
three Tun through the main Ocean, and after having suffer’d terrible Tempests,
arriv’d in the space of seven Weeks safe in <i>Ireland</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>These Islands are remarkable for divers sorts of Plants, unknown in other Parts,
as the <i>Prickle Pear</i>, <i>Poyson Weed</i>, <i>Red Weed</i>, <i>Purging Bean</i>, <i>Costive Tree</i>, <i>Red Pepper</i>, and
the <i>Sea Feather</i>. Also several strange Birds, as the <i>Egg Bird</i>, <i>Cahow</i>, <i>Tropick Bird</i>, and
the <i>Pemlico</i>, which presageth Storms.</p>

<h3 id='c314' class='c001'>CHAP. XIII.<br /> Hispaniola.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>The Islands call’d <i>De Barlovento</i>, by which are understood <i>Hispaniola</i>, <i>Cuba</i>,
<i>Jamaica</i>, and <i>Boriquen</i>, as also the <i>Lucaies</i>, with the <i>Caribes</i>, and lastly the Isles
call’d <i>De Sotavento</i>, viz. <i>Margareta</i>, <i>Cabagua</i>, and <i>Tabago</i>, are by some comprehended
all under the general Name of <i>The Isles Antilles</i>; though others reckon
the <i>Antilles</i> to be the same with the <i>Caribes</i> onely. But leaving this Controversie
undecided, we shall begin with the Isles <i>De Barlovento</i>, the chief whereof is <i>Hispaniola</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Bounds and Description of <i>Hispaniola</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Hispaniola</i>, or <i>Little Spain</i> (as <i>Columbus</i> nam’d it) is, though not the largest, yet the
fairest and goodliest of all the <i>American</i> Islands, call’d by the Natives anciently <i>Hayti</i>
and <i>Quisqueia</i>: It lieth about fifteen Leagues Westward of <i>Porto Rico</i>, and distant
from the main Land of <i>America</i> about one hundred and twenty; ’tis of a triangular
form, the sharpest Point whereof is that towards <i>Porto Rico</i>, which they call
<i>Cabo de Enganno</i>: that towards the West inclines to a Semi-circle, containing a
good and convenient Bay betwixt the two Points, <i>viz.</i> <i>St. Nicholas</i> to the North,
and <i>Cabo de Donna Maria</i> towards the South. It is not thought to be less than a
hundred and fifty Leagues in length, and in breadth from threescore to thirty, and
to contain in the compass of the whole, four hundred Leagues at least, lying betwixt
eighteen and twenty Degrees of Northern Latitude, having an Air somewhat
infested with the Morning Heats, but well cool’d again in the Afternoon, by a constant
Wind from the Sea, which they call there <i>Virason</i>. It is, for the fertility of the
Soil, one of the richest and most flourishing Countreys in the World; the Trees
and all things else there continually clad, as it were, in their Summer Livery,
the Meadows and Pastures always green, and of such an excellent Herbage, that
Cattel both breed and thrive there beyond belief; both great Cattel and small, as
Kine, Sheep, Hogs, <i>&amp;c.</i> brought thither out of <i>Spain</i>, having multiply’d to such
numbers, that they live wild now in Herds in several places, and are both hunted
and kill’d, like Stags or other Venison, onely for their Hides, which they send yearly
into <i>Spain</i> and other parts of <i>Europe</i>, as a great Merchandize and Commodity of
huge profit to them.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>
<img src='images/i_359.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>Wild Hogs also have been formerly seen to feed in the Woods in great multitudes,
but the Dogs since they were brought over hither, have made great havock
amongst them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Beasts peculiar to <i>Hispaniola</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Animals peculiar to this Island are 1. A little Beast call’d <i>Hutias</i>, not much
unlike our Coneys. 2. <i>Chemi</i>, almost of the same form, but a little bigger. 3. <i>Mohui</i>,
A Beast somewhat less than the <i>Hutias</i>. 4. A Beast call’d <i>Coxi</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fly <i>Cuyero</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Likewise amongst other strange sorts of Creatures here, the <i>Cuyero</i> is very observable,
being about an Inch big, and having four Wings, of which two are larger
than the other: when they flie they shine after such a manner, that in the Night
they make a Room as light as day, insomuch that some have made use of them in
stead of Candles to Read by.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fish <i>Manate</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>No less wonderful is the Fish <i>Manate</i>, whose shape hath been describ’d elsewhere:
It breeds for the most part in the Sea, yet sometimes swimming up the
Rivers, comes ashore and eats Grass. The Casique <i>Caramatexi</i> kept one in the Lake
<i>Guaynato</i>, which was so tame, that when call’d by the Name <i>Maton</i>, it us’d to come
out of the Water, and go directly to the <i>Casique</i>’s House, where being fed, it return’d
to the Lake, accompanied with Men and Boys, who with their Singing seem’d to
delight the Fish, which sometimes carried ten Children on its Back over the Water;
but at last a <i>Spaniard</i> striking at it with a Pike, it would never come forth again
when it espy’d a Cloth’d Man: It liv’d twenty six years in the fore-mention’d
Lake, till by accident the River <i>Hayboaic</i> over-flowing into the said Lake, the Fish
return’d to the Sea.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fish <i>Abacatuaia</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Besides this great Fish, here is also a sort of small Fish, call’d <i>Abacatuaia</i>, with a
little Mouth, black Eyes encompass’d with Silver-colour’d Circles, four black Fins,
two long ones under its Belly, one on the Back, and one on each side of the Head,
the Tail slit and cover’d with a glittering Skin: It is as big as a Flounder, and not
ill Meat, but thick and round.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Insect <i>Nigua</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>When the <i>Spaniards</i> first setled on <i>Hispaniola</i>, they were exceedingly tormented
with a sort of leaping Insects call’d <i>Nigua</i>, which us’d to eat through their Skin into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>the Flesh in such a nature, that many of them lost their Arms and Legs; but at last
they found out a Remedy against this Evil, <i>viz.</i> the searing the Wounds with hot
Irons.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fruits.</div>

<p class='c010'>Besides the aforesaid plenty of Flesh, they have many excellent Fruits all the
year long, as Banana’s, Pine-Apples, Custud-Apples, Plantens, Papans, Musk-melons,
Water-melons, and many other peculiar Plants, as 1. the <i>Auzuba</i>, a fair
large Tree, the Fruit whereof is call’d <i>Pinnas</i>, resembling a <i>Malecotoon</i>: Of this
Tree there are three sorts, <i>Jaima</i>, <i>Boniama</i>, and <i>Jaiqua</i>; 2. <i>Quauconex</i>; 3. <i>Axi</i>; of
which there are also several sorts, as <i>Carive</i>, <i>Huarahuac</i>, <i>Axiblanco</i>, <i>Acafran-Axi</i>, and
<i>Axi-Coral</i>; 4. <i>Yuca</i>, the Root of which serves in stead of Corn; 5. Certain Trees
call’d <i>Guaibes</i>, besides plenty of Mint and Potato’s.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Provinces of this Island.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Island of <i>Hispaniola</i> was formerly divided into several Provinces, amongst
which the Mountainous Countrey <i>Hyguey</i> lies towards the Isle of <i>Porto Rico</i>. On
the Mountains, which are flat on the top, are great variety of sharp-pointed
Stones. The Soil is a sort of colour’d Earth, which produces all sorts of Fruit,
especially the Root <i>Casabi</i>, and Melons.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Hyguey</i> also conterminates with <i>Ycayagua</i>; Northward lies <i>Samana</i>; Southward,
<i>Yaquimo</i>, where there is store of <i>Brasile</i> Wood: And between the City <i>Domingo</i> and
<i>Yaquimo</i>, is the Countrey <i>Baoruco</i>, which with its Mountains extends sixty Leagues
in length, and above twenty in breadth, without any Water, Pasture, or Food for
Cattel or Mankind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next follows the Countrey <i>Xaragua</i>, lying at the great Inlet which divides <i>Hispaniola</i>;
for one side extends to the Promontory of <i>St. Nicholas</i>, and the other to
the Point <i>Tiburon</i>. This Countrey produces abundance of Cotton.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, the Provinces <i>Guahaba</i>, <i>Haniguagya</i> and <i>Cahay</i>, are very eminent; as also
<i>Cibao</i>, which is full of Gold-Mines; and <i>Lavega Real</i>, with <i>Magnana</i>, which lie between
the two great Rivers <i>Neyba</i> and <i>Yagui</i>; the stony Countrey <i>Ciguayos</i>, and the
low Coast <i>Darica</i>, where <i>Christopher Columbus</i> built the City <i>Navidad</i>, which he afterwards
deserted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ginger was formerly brought hither from the <i>East-Indies</i>, but now grows here in
such great abundance, that above two and twenty thousand <i>Kintalls</i> are yearly
Transported from thence to <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>With as good success grow here also the Sugar-Canes and <i>Maiz</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter Martyr</i>, a Councellor to the Emperor <i>Charles</i> the Fifth, relates, That <i>Hispaniola</i>
produc’d in his time, besides Silver, Copper, and Iron, five hundred thousand
<i>Ducats</i> in Gold: Nevertheless the rich Mines lay undisturb’d, because they
wanted People to work in them, insomuch that had they not planted their Royal
Seat in <i>Domingo</i>, the Island had long since been deserted, notwithstanding the exceeding
fruitfulness of the Soil, because the <i>Spaniards</i> exercis’d their Cruelty in such
a nature, that of sixty thousand Inhabitants from the Year 1508. to <i>Anno 1514.</i> scarce
fourteen thousand of them were left alive; all which is affirm’d by the Bishop <i>De
las Casas</i>. Nay, the fore-mention’d <i>Peter Martyr</i> relates, That the Men wearied
with working in the Mines, kill’d themselves, despairing of ever being releas’d
from their Slavery; and Women with Child destroy’d the Infants in their
Wombs, that they might not bear Slaves for the <i>Spaniards</i>. He adds hereunto,
That of a hundred and twenty thousand Persons, few were left in a short
time.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Gaiety of the antient <i>Casiques</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>These Provinces in former times had each of them their <i>Casique</i>, whose splendor
consisted chiefly in Dancing to his Devotion, with a Girdle full of Bells about his
Middle, a String of Pearls about his Arms, a Covering over his Privities, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>Plume of Feathers on his Head, with a Drummer before him, and a small Train
of Arm’d Men after him.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Ports and Havens.</div>

<p class='c010'>On the Coast are first the Point of <i>Nisao</i>, ten Leagues to the West of <i>Santo Domingo</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eighteen Leagues farther is the Port <i>Ocoa</i>, which is a Bay where the Fleets of
<i>Nova Hispania</i> take refreshing, when they do not Anchor in the Nook of <i>Sepesepin</i>,
which is near unto it, or in another call’d <i>The Fair Haven</i>, two Leagues before you
come to <i>Ocoa</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Twenty Leagues beyond <i>Ocoa</i> is the Port of <i>Asua</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thirty Leagues more Westwardly is a large Point right against the Island of
<i>Bola</i>, which lieth five Leagues from the Coast.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most Westerly Point is call’d <i>Cape Tiburon</i>: It hath an Island three Leagues
from it Westward, call’d <i>Caprio</i>; and Sailing along the Coast, you will see an Island
call’d <i>Camito</i>, and farther in the Nook of <i>Yaguana</i> another call’d <i>Guanabo</i> of eight
Leagues long.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the North side of the Island, the most Westerly Cape and Port is <i>St. Nicholas</i>,
from whence North-East and by East, lieth the Island of <i>Tortuga</i>, near the Coast
of <i>Hispaniola</i>: It is of five Leagues length.</p>

<p class='c010'>Farther along the Coast is <i>Monte Christo</i>, the West Cape of <i>Natividad</i>; to the East
of which there is a great Bay call’d <i>Port Real</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Island is so full of Harbours, that he that will Coast it, cannot well miss
of one where he pleaseth, most of which afford fresh Meat and good Water.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, <i>Hispaniola</i> hath many brave Rivers, the chiefest of which are <i>Hayna</i>;
<i>Nizao</i>, along whose Shore the first Sugar-Canes were planted; <i>Neyba</i>, a great River;
<i>Yaquimo</i>; <i>Yaqui</i>, which <i>Columbus</i> call’d <i>Rio de Oro</i>, because the Ground thereof
glitter’d like Gold; and lastly, the Rivers <i>Nicayagua</i>, amongst whose Sands is
Gold; <i>Nigua</i>, which borrows its Denomination from the fore-mention’d leaping
Insect; the swift Stream <i>Juno</i>, whose Banks are crown’d with handsom Houses;
and <i>Jaquin</i>, which hath many Salt-pans.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>The Rivers <i>Itabo</i>, <i>Ocoa</i>, <i>Cepi</i>, <i>Bia</i>, <i>Cazui</i>, <i>Sanate de Plata</i>, and <i>Chiabon</i>, have some
one, others more Sugar-Mills upon them.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the chiefest River is <i>Ozama</i>, broad, and so deep, that the biggest Vessel may
lie close by the Shore; and also washes <i>St. Domingo</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the City of <i>St. Domingo</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>This City, the Metropolis of all the Isles round about, was built by <i>Bartholomeus
Columbus</i>, and was peopled <i>Anno 1494.</i> after which it flourish’d eight years, when,
a terrible Storm blowing the same down to the Ground, <i>Nicholas Olanda</i> remov’d
it to the Western Shore of <i>Ozama</i>, that the <i>Spaniards</i>, who had for the most part setled
towards the West, might not be necessitated to Ferry over: but the first place
stood much more conveniently, being not onely provided of a Fountain of sweet
Water, but also freed of those unwholsom Vapours which daily rise with the Sun
at this new-built City. To prevent the inconvenience of crossing to the foremention’d
Fountain, of which the Inhabitants found themselves oftentimes in
great want, <i>Olanda</i> went about to lead the neighboring River <i>Hayna</i> into the <i>Ozama</i>,
but the Design not being prosecuted, bereav’d <i>Domingo</i> of the onely thing which
would have made it able to stand in competition with any City in the World; for
it lies on a Plain, the South side whereof is wash’d by the Sea; the East side, by
the River; on the North and West are many delightful Fields.</p>

<p class='c010'>The City, which in a manner is built square, is divided into long straight
Streets, full of fair Houses after the <i>Spanish</i> manner: in the middle thereof is a
square Market-place, with a handsom Church, the Yard whereof is encompass’d
with a high Wall, which upon occasion would serve for a place of great Defence.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Collectors of the King of <i>Spain</i>’s Revenue dwell in stately Palaces; and
the <i>Dominicans</i>, <i>Franciscans</i>, and Monks <i>De la Merced</i>, have brave Cloysters, besides
two more for the Nuns.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Latine</i> School and Hospital belonging to the City, are Endow’d with great
yearly Revenues.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Arch-bishop of <i>St. Domingo</i> hath Command over the Bishoprick of <i>Conception</i>,
<i>La Vega</i>, <i>Cuba</i>, <i>Venezuela</i>, and <i>Porto Rico</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The City is surrounded with a Stone Wall, and fortifi’d with a Castle, which
with two Bulwarks reaches to the River <i>Ozama</i>, and within them two Half-Moons.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the utmost Shore stands a round Tower near the Southern Bulwark.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before the new discover’d Countreys entic’d away many People from <i>St. Domingo</i>,
and the Silver Fleet put into <i>Havana</i>, the Inhabitants drove a great Trade in
Hides, Tallow, Sugar, <i>Cassia</i>, Horses, and Hogs.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Anno 1586.</i> Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> Landed here with twelve hundred <i>English</i>-men, took
the City by Storm, staid a whole Moneth in the same, and upon Composition with
the <i>Spaniard</i>, left it undestroy’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Other chief Towns of <i>Hispaniola</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Other chief Towns in <i>Hispaniola</i> are 1. <i>Salvaleon</i>, twenty eight Leagues distant
from <i>St. Domingo</i>, towards the East.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Zeybo.</i> 3. <i>Cotny</i>, formerly inhabited by those that work’d in the Gold-Mines;
the last especially was once a rich Town, and much frequented, but now
in a manner deserted.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>Azua</i>, or <i>New Compostella</i>, eight Leagues distant from <i>St. Domingo</i>, famous
for the Sugar-Mills not far from it, and one of the Ports before-mention’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <i>Yaguana</i>, for its brave Harbour also call’d <i>Maria del Puerto</i>, in the more Western
parts of the Island; a small Town not above a League distant from the Sea;
It was burnt by Captain <i>Christopher Newport</i>.</p>

<i>St. Domingo</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>8. <i>Puerto de Plata</i>, or <i>The Silver Haven</i>, four Leagues distant from <i>St. Domingo</i> towards
the North: It hath been counted the second Place of Trading and Wealth
in the whole Island, being commodiously seated on an Arm of the Sea, and fortifi’d
with a Castle.</p>

<p class='c010'>9. <i>Monte Christo</i>, one of the Ports also above-mention’d: It lies fourteen Leagues
Westward of <i>Plata</i>, and extends it self along the Northern Coast: it is wash’d by
the River <i>Yagui</i>, on whose Banks are many Salt-pans.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Island dispeopled by the cruelty of the <i>Spaniards</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Their barbarous usage of <i>Guaccanarillo</i> and others.</div>

<p class='c010'>All those Cities are much decay’d, and thinly inhabited, the <i>Spaniards</i> being most
of them drawn by the temptation of new discover’d Gold and Silver Mines in
other places, and the first Inhabitants having been miserably destroy’d. The Bishop
<i>De las Casas</i>, an Eye-witness, relates, That the King <i>Gauccanarillo</i> secur’d the
Goods of a stranded Ship, of which <i>Columbus</i> was Commander, and receiv’d the <i>Spaniards</i>
very courteously; but not being able to continue supplying them with that
quantity of Gold they requir’d, wanting Men to gather so much out of the Streams
and Mines, and seeing no way to rid himself from the <i>Spaniards</i> Oppressions, fled
to the Province of <i>Ciguayos</i>, the <i>Casique</i> of which was his Deputy; whereat the <i>Spaniards</i>
were so enrag’d, that they burnt all that they could meet with, neither sparing
young nor old; and at length taking <i>Guaccanarillo</i>, put him in Irons, and
thought to have carried him to <i>Madrid</i>; but the Ship in which he went suffering
Shipwrack, he with many others was cast away, being before almost dead with
grief for his Consort, who had been Ravish’d by a <i>Spanish</i> Commander, Likewise
<i>Anacoana</i>, Sister to the <i>Casique</i>, or Governor of the Province <i>Xarana</i>, and Partner
with him in the Government, seeing three hundred of her Councellors burning in
a great House, set on fire by the <i>Spaniards</i>, and her Subjects torn by Dogs, or cut in
pieces, hung her self out of despair. The same Death died <i>Higuanama</i>, Queen of
<i>Huguey</i>. Others say that <i>Anacoana</i> was put to death together with her Brother in a
most barbarous and cruel manner, by <i>Nicholas de Olanda</i>, who succeeded <i>Diego de
Arana</i> in the Government of this Island. Many Women and Children were kept
alive onely to Manure the Ground. The Men dying of their hard Labour in the
Gold-Mines, and those which endur’d stoutly the cruel Labour under Ground,
were never suffer’d to go to their Wives; from whence proceeded a great decrease
of People, the <i>Spaniards</i> seeming purposely to design the destruction of the Natives
of <i>Hispaniola</i>, though they receiv’d great benefit by their Service; for Gold in
former times was found between the Cracks and split Stones of the Mountains,
whose Veins the Mine-workers digg’d for not without great and dangerous Labour.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First original of the People of <i>Hispaniola</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The first Planters of <i>Hispaniola</i> are, according to the common opinion, deriv’d
from <i>Matinio</i>, a high and Mountainous Isle, from whence the most eminent Inhabitants
were driven by certain Rebels, as formerly the <i>Syrians</i> under the Government
of <i>Dido</i>, were driven from <i>Tyre</i> to <i>Lybia</i>, and the <i>Batavians</i> from <i>Hessen</i> to the Countrey
between <i>Rhyne</i> and <i>Wall</i>, at present inhabited by the <i>Gelders</i> and <i>Hollanders</i>.
These <i>Matininoensians</i> thus expell’d from their native Countrey, setled themselves on
<i>Cahonao</i>, near the River <i>Bahaboni</i>: The first House they call’d <i>Camoteia</i>, and afterwards
turn’d it into a Temple, to which they shew’d Reverence, and made great
Presents: In like manner the <i>Tyema</i>, which stood on a high Rock belonging to one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>of the <i>Canary</i> Islands, was by the ancient Inhabitants of the Place had in great veneration,
insomuch that many leap’d down from the same, being perswaded by the
Priests, That the Souls of those which threw themselves off this sacred Break-neck,
should immediately be translated into a place of everlasting happiness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The ancient Name of this Island.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Island was, as we said before, first call’d <i>Haity</i> which signifies <i>Wild</i>, because
in many places it swells with wondrous high Mountains, and in other places
is over-grown with great Woods: it was afterwards by the ancient Inhabitants
nam’d <i>Xusqueia</i>, that is, <i>Unmeasurably great</i>, because they suppos’d it to be the
whole World, and that the Sun shin’d in no other place.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Indian</i> Songs or Ballads call’d <i>Areitos</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Natives of this Island, though wholly rude of acquir’d Knowledge or Literature,
like the generality of the <i>Americans</i>, yet they took care to instruct their Children
in the Original and Antiquities of their Countrey, and the Wars and Exploits
of their Predecessors, both which they contain’d in Songs call’d <i>Areitos</i> which they
us’d to Sing to the sound of Drums and Trumpets; but especially their Persons of
chiefest Quality study’d most these <i>Areitos</i>, and exercis’d themselves in Dancing.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Prediction of the <i>Spaniards</i> Arrival.</div>

<p class='c010'>The most remarkable of these ancient <i>Areitos</i>, were such as pretended to prophesie
of things to come, which if of sad consequence, were Sung very mournfully
and with many Sighs; nor were they always, however inspir’d, without effect, as
appear’d at last by woful event: for long before the <i>Spaniards</i> Landed on <i>Hispaniola</i>,
it was foretold by one of them, that <i>Maguacochios</i>, signifying <i>Clothed People</i>, should
Land on  <i>Hispaniola</i>, who with sharp Weapons should cut off Heads and Arms, and
under whose insupportable Yoke their Successors must spend their days without
hope of ever being releas’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>It might be disputed whether these Predictions were dictated by good or evil
Spirits; but it is generally believ’d, that all their Oracles, whether hapning true or
false, were suggested by diabolical Spirits to the Priests, who commonly convers’d
with them; and that these Spirits knew the Design of several People to discover
new Countreys.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Images of their <i>Zemes</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Images <i>Zemes</i>, stuff’d full of Cotton, were fashion’d into very frightful
Shapes, and might pass for those things which we call <i>Terricula</i>, or <i>Bugbears</i>; of
which some were made very small, and those they ty’d on their Foreheads when
they went to the Wars. Every Governor had a peculiar <i>Zemes</i>, to whom he shew’d
Reverence, in return whereof he expected Rain, fair Weather, and to conquer his
Enemies, supposing him to be a Messenger of a perpetual and endless Being, by
them call’d <i>Jocauna Guamaonocon</i>; whom nevertheless they suppos’d to have a Mother,
to whom they gave five Names, <i>viz.</i> <i>Attbeir</i>, <i>Mamona</i>, <i>Guacarapita</i>, <i>Liella</i>, and
<i>Guimazoa</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Islanders Opinion of the Creation.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their opinion of Man’s Creation was thus: They say, that out from a Mountain
in the Province <i>Cuanana</i>, out of certain small and great Caverns therein, came
little and great People: The biggest Hole, call’d <i>Cazibaragua</i>, and the little one,
nam’d <i>Amaiauna</i>, were said to be lock’d up every Night, that none might pass the
Sentinel  <i>Machchael</i>, who out of curiosity leaving the Mountain <i>Cuata</i>, and going up
into the Countrey, was discover’d by the Sun, whose Beams he not being able to
endure, was turn’d into a Rock. The like Mischance hapned to many others, who
in the dark Night going to Fish, in the Morning at their Return were chang’d into
Oaken Trees, onely one of the Fishermen was sent away by the chief Commander
<i>Vaguoniana</i>, who moved at the Complaint of a Nightingale’s Singing, suffer’d all
the Men to go into the Hole, and the Women and Children he Transported to
<i>Matinino</i>. But to make short of these non-sensical Stories, in conclusion, the Men
being let out of their Caves, saw many strange Beasts amongst the Woods, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>being turn’d into Women, were entertain’d by them, and brought forth a numerous
Progeny, which spread over all <i>Hispaniola</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their foolish Opinion of the Original of the Sea.</div>

<p class='c010'>No less ridiculous an Account do the Priests give concerning the Original of
the Sea, <i>viz.</i> That <i>Jaia</i>, a mighty Man, buried the Body of his deceased Son in a
Pumpion, which some Moneths after, out of meer affection to the Deceased, he cutting
open, abundance of Whales sprung out of it. This Wonder being every where
known, amongst others, entic’d four Brothers born at one Birth (whose Mother
died in Childbed) to get the Pumpion into their possession; which their Design
prov’d successful: but afterwards struck with a pannick fear of <i>Jaia</i>’s coming thither
(who oftentimes came to mourn over the Bones of his dead Son) they fled,
and threw away the Pumpion, which breaking with the fall, the Sea gush’d out of
all places thereof, and cover’d the Plains in such a manner, that nothing of them
was seen, onely the tops of the highest Mountains appear’d; at which the four
Brothers terribly afrighted, rang’d through barren Desarts, in which they had died
of Hunger, had they not come to a Baker’s House, which one of them entring,
ask’d for <i>Cazabi</i>; but the Baker denying them Bread, spit on them, which caus’d
a mortal Dropsie, which the Brothers upon consultation found no way to cure,
but by cutting a hole in the Skin with a sharp Stone, and to let out the Water;
but out of each running Wound sprung a Woman, who bare them four Sons and
four Daughters.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Cave <i>Jovana-beina</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>There is a certain Cave call’d <i>Jovana-beina</i>, which is adorn’d with a thousand
Pictures, in great esteem amongst them; at the Entrance on each side whereof
stands a <i>Zemes</i>; that on the right side is call’d <i>Binthaitelles</i>, the other <i>Marohur</i>, to
which they come from all places to pay their Devotions, because (they say) the
Sun and Moon came out of the said Cave to lighten the World.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their absurd Opinion of the Deceased.</div>

<p class='c010'>Much after the same absurd rate is their Opinion of the Deceased; for they suppose
that they range through Woods and Forrests in the Night, eat of a Fruit call’d
<i>Guannaba</i>, and steal to the Embraces of Women in Moon-shiny Nights. A Traveller,
say they, if he be frighted at the appearance of a deceased Person, great inconveniences
will certainly attend him, but if he goes stoutly towards it, then the
Goblin vanishes.</p>

<p class='c010'>These Delusions are made great Mysteries amongst them, and contain’d in
Songs, which their Priests <i>Boiti</i> Sing to a kind of Tabor made of a piece of hollow
Wood, pretending that they have familiar Conversation with the <i>Zemes</i> concerning
future things.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Ceremonies about their Sick.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Ceremonies about their sick, especially if Persons of Quality, are likewise
very remarkably odd and conceited: First they chew a strong kind of Herb,
call’d <i>Cohobba</i>, with which having sufficiently intoxicated their Brains, they foam at
the Mouth, and run with a Stone and a piece of Flesh in their Mouths to the sick
Person, whose Family they drive all out of Doors, except one or two, whose presence
the Patient requires; then the <i>Boiti</i> walks four times about the sick Person’s
Bed, making strange Gestures, pinching his Lips and Nose, blowing upon his
Forehead, Throat and Temples, and sucking several parts of his Body, alledging,
that thereby he draws the Distemper out of the Veins; after that he chafes and
rubs his Shoulders, Thighs and Legs, and ties his Hands and Feet together, then
running to the Door, proclaims, That the Sick in a short time shall be restor’d to
his former Health; which said, he returns with his Arms stretch’d out towards
the sick Person, takes the piece of Flesh out of his Mouth, which he gives him
backwards, saying, <i>You shall rise and go forth in Health, for I have taken away your Sickness</i>:
But if he judges the Distemper not curable, he makes the Sick believe, that <i>Zemes</i> is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>displeas’d with him, because he did not build a House for him, or consecrate a
Garden to him, or in some respect or other did not worship him as he ought to
have done. When the Soul departs out of the Body, they conjure the Body with
many Adjurations, to reveal whether it died according to God’s decree, or through
neglect of the <i>Boiti</i>, as not having sanctifi’d himself enough by Fasting when he
went first to the Sick, or not prescrib’d sufficient Medicines: wherefore if (as they
say) the Devil answers them from the Mouth of the Deceased, that the <i>Boiti</i> did
not perform his due Office, then the nearest Friends revenge themselves on the <i>Boiti</i>,
but if otherwise, then they are highly esteem’d amongst them. The Women taking
the Stones which the <i>Boiti</i> kept in his Mouth, wrap them up in a fine Cloth
as a holy Relique, supposing that they will much facilitate their Child-birth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their manner of Consulting with their <i>Zemes</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Casiques</i> desirous to know future Events of War, or whether the approaching
Years will be fruitful, go into a Chappel consecrated to the <i>Zemes</i>, and snuff
the intoxicating Herb <i>Cohobba</i> up their Nostrils; whereupon they break out into
loud Exclamations, and some kind of strange extravagant Actions, till the power of
the <i>Cohobba</i> begins to decay, and the Frenzie cease; then coming again to their Senses,
they bow their Heads, and lay their Elbows on their Knees, in which posture
they sit for a considerable time, then lifting up their Eyes they yawn as if
they came from sleep; then they mutter to themselves whilest their Retinue which
stand about them (for no common Person is suffer’d to be there) thank them with a
loud Voice, for the pains they have been at in discoursing with the <i>Zemes</i>; then
the <i>Casiques</i> begin to declare what hath been reveal’d to them, <i>viz.</i> whether they
shall be fortunate in the Wars or not; whether it will be a fruitful or unfruitful,
healthy or sickly Year.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gossipping.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, at the Birth of the <i>Casique</i>’s Children, the neighboring Governors visit
the Women in Child-bed, and every one gives the Child a peculiar Name, from
whence it happens that one Man hath oftentimes forty Names, and is highly incens’d
if any one of them chances to be forgot in any Writing directed to him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Manner of Succession.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their manner of Succession in Government is not unremarkable; for not the
eldest Heir-male of the Family, but first the King or <i>Casique</i>’s Brother, if he have
any, and after his Decease the eldest of the Sisters Inherits the Realm or <i>Seigniorie</i>:
if the Sisters have no Male-issue, then the Brothers Sons Inherit; and in case they
have no Male-heir, then the next of Blood, whether Male or Female: but if the
Prince or <i>Casique</i> dies without Children, Nephews, or other near Relations, the next
in Power in the Countrey Inherits, and Marries as many Wives as he pleases; of
which she that he loves best is burn’d alive in her best Apparel with her Husband
when he dies, and near the Corps stands a Cup of Water and some of the Bread
<i>Cazabi</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Languages.</div>

<p class='c010'>There are several Languages in <i>Hispaniola</i>, but differing from each other: for in
the Province <i>Bainoa</i> they have a different, both Pronunciation and Dialect from that
in <i>Caizimu</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the said Province of <i>Caizimu</i> is a very remarkable Rock, or vast Stone to be
seen, at the Foot of a high Mountain; and underneath the said Stone is a great
Cave, into which they go through a large Passage, not unlike a Temple Door;
near which conjoyn many deep Rivers, with such a Noise and Foam, that they
lose both their Sight and Hearing, whoever approach the same.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An Example of the <i>Bainoan</i> Language.</div>

<p class='c010'>Of the Language of the Province <i>Bainoa</i>, <i>Peter Martyr</i> gives us this Specimen:
“The Wife of a <i>Casique</i> (says he) went to Prayers in a Chappel which was built by
the <i>Spaniards</i>; at her Return from whence her Husband desiring to enjoy her,
she refusing, said, <i>Teitoca, teitoca, techeta Cynato guammechina</i>, that is to say, <i>Be contented,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>Be contented, God would be highly incens’d</i>: to which the <i>Casique</i> answer’d,
<i>Gnaibba Cynato machabucha guamechyna</i>, that is, <i>What care I if God be angry</i>.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The taking of <i>St. Domingo</i> by Sir <i>Fran. Drake</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Since the <i>Spaniards</i> had first possession of this Island, it hath been twice Invaded
by the <i>English</i>, the first time under the Conduct of Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>, who took the
Town of <i>San Domingo</i>, staid in it a good while, and could if he had pleas’d, have
totally dispossess’d the <i>Spaniards</i>; the second time under Colonel <i>Venables</i>, sent
thither by <i>Oliver Cromwell</i> during his usurp’d Dominion; at which time it might
as easily have been taken as at first, had not the Business been rashly and indiscreetly
manag’d, as shall presently be declar’d more at large. The first Expedition of Sir
<i>Francis Drake</i> hath been already hinted, but for the memorableness of that bold
Exploit, we shall give a particular Account of it from a late Writer, who hath set
forth the Life of that brave <i>English</i> Heroe. In the Year of our Lord 1580. about the
end of <i>February</i> setting Sail from <i>St. Christophers</i> for <i>Hispaniola</i>, by the Way they met
with a small Frigat bound for <i>San Domingo</i>, and the Men of her being Examin’d,
one assur’d them that the Haven of it was a barr’d Haven, and the Shore well
fortifi’d, so that there was no convenient Landing within ten <i>English</i> Miles of the
City, whither this Man undertook to conduct them. <i>January</i> the first they Landed
ten Miles from the City, and marching thither under the Command of the Lieutenant
General, arriv’d about one a Clock in the Afternoon; when they came near,
about a hundred and fifty Gentlemen well Mounted, presented themselves against
them; but the small Shot playing upon them, they departed, and the <i>English</i> proceeded
towards the two Gates of the City that lay towards the Sea, both which the
<i>Spaniards</i> had Mann’d, and planted their Ordnance without the Gates, and some
small Shot in an Ambush by the Way-side: The <i>English</i> being about twelve hundred
Men, divided themselves; the Lieutenant-General leading the one half to one
Gate, and Captain <i>Powel</i> the other half to the other Gate, vowing that with God’s
assistance they would not rest till they met in the Market-place: No sooner had the
<i>Spaniards</i> discharg’d their Ordnance, doing some little Execution, but the Lieutenant-General
hasted, or rather ran upon them, to prevent their Charging again,
and notwithstanding their Ambush, entred Pell Mell with them into the Gate, not
staying till he came into the Market-place, unto whom shortly after came Captain
<i>Powel</i> with his Companies. This Place they strengthned with Barricado’s, the
City being too large to be guarded by so small and weary an Army. And after
Mid-night they in the Castle, hearing some of the <i>English</i> busie about the Gate,
quitted it, some being taken Prisoners, and others escaping by Boats. The next
day the <i>English</i> enlarg’d their Quarters, and fortifi’d themselves, and held the Town
for a Moneths space. During this time the General sent a <i>Negro</i> Boy with a Flag
of Truce to the <i>Spaniards</i>, who by the Way was met by some Officers of the Galley
which the <i>English</i> had taken, together with the City, who furiously thrust the poor
Boy through the Body; who returning to the General, and having declar’d how
barbarously they had us’d him, fell down and died in his Presence. The General
being much mov’d herewith, commanded the Provost-Martial to take two Fryers,
and to carry them to the same place with a sufficient Guard, and there to hang
them; and withal he sent one of the Prisoners to inform the <i>Spaniards</i> why he did
it, and to tell them, that till the Party who had thus murder’d his Messenger were
deliver’d to him, there should no day pass wherein he would not hang two Prisoners,
till all were consum’d. Hereupon the day following the Murtherer was
brought, and an Offer made to deliver him to the General, who yet thought it more
honorable to make them perform the Execution themselves in the sight of the <i>English</i>,
which was done accordingly.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>During their abode here, Commissioners oft pass’d between the <i>Spaniards</i> and
them about the Ransom of the City, but not agreeing, the <i>English</i> spent every
Morning till the heat of the Day in firing and destroying the Houses in the outward
part of the City, two hundred Mariners being employ’d therein for divers
days; yet were the Houses built so magnificently and strongly of Stone, that they
could not consume one third part of the Town all that time; whereupon the General
was contented to accept of twenty five thousand <i>Ducats</i> of 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> apiece to
spare the rest.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here his Soldiers met with good Pillage, especially of rich Apparel, but Treasure
they found none; for the <i>Spaniards</i> by their Cruelties had so destroy’d the Natives,
who us’d to work in the Mines of Gold and Silver, that they were wholly
given over; and in that Island they were forc’d to use Copper Money: yet they
found store of Wine, Oyl, Vinegar, Wheat, Woollen and Linnen Cloth, some
Silks, <i>&amp;c.</i> which much reliev’d them: there was but little Plate found, but good
store of <i>Porcelane</i>, or <i>China</i> Dishes; yet some they found, and very costly Houshold-stuff.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Venables</i> his Expedition to <i>San Domingo</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Venables</i> his Expedition was in the Year 1654. when <i>Cromwell</i> having gain’d the
supream Power under the Title of <i>Protector</i>, and having us’d so many Engines for
the getting of Money to maintain his Greatness and usurp’d Authority, that
he was almost brought to his last Shifts, bethought himself of this Project, (or,
as some suppose, had it put into his Head by Cardinal <i>Mazarine</i>, the then great
Minister of State in <i>France</i>, with whom he had intimate Correspondence) thinking
thereby to kill two Birds with one Stone: for on the one side, he thought by this
notable Exploit to advance his Fame abroad, and gain Credit and Applause with
the People at home, by enlarging his Empire, and spreading the Renown of the
<i>English</i> Nation, and so consequently to establish himself the more firmly in his new
gotten Power; and at the same time by the great Riches he promis’d to himself
from this Adventure, to recruit his Stock, which all his griping Exactions, especially
from the King’s Party, could scarce supply for the keeping up of his Army,
maintaining Intelligence, and other vast Expences: To this end he sets forth a considerable
Fleet with extraordinary speed and secrecy, it not being known whither
this Fleet was design’d till they were almost upon the very Place, that the <i>Spaniard</i>
might not be forewarn’d to provide against them, onely in general terms it was
given out, that the Design was both advantageous to the Nation, and would prove
a great enrichment to all that went upon it; so that it is no great wonder, if within
a short space a good competent Army was got together of such as having neither
Estates nor Employments, willingly offer’d themselves, as Men that went from the
fear of Iron Grates, to the hopes of Golden Ingots; and many of them were such as
having been in the late King’s Army, and disdaining to take any Employment at
home under that Government, were easily induc’d to List themselves in this Armada:
nor was <i>Oliver</i> a little glad of this occasion of sending out of the Land, and employing
upon a desperate Adventure those Men, who he had reason to suspect would, upon
any opportunity offer’d, be the first Opposers of his usurp’d Power. This Army
being sent to <i>Portsmouth</i> for Embarquation, and there making such Preparations
as was convenient, which a Moneths time or thereabouts was thought would accomplish,
a Messenger came from <i>Desborough</i> (who was there to set them going) to
the General, that he should prepare to Embarque on <i>Christmas</i>-day; which at the
first the General receiv’d with great impatience, alledging, That it was not possible
so to do, and that he would not set Sail without his Arms and other Necessaries,
which were not yet come from <i>London</i>: however, at his going to <i>Desborough</i> he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>prevail’d upon to set Sail, with a promise that the Ships with the Arms should
immediately follow him to the <i>Barbado</i>’s, where he was to stay till their arrival;
so on <i>Christmas</i>-day they set Sail, and about the fourteenth of <i>February</i> arriv’d at <i>Barbado</i>’s
with three thousand Men, and a Company of Reformado’s, which there
were doubled, and then, and not till then, it was told them, That the reason of their
so sudden going away, was because there was a Plot forming in <i>England</i> for restoring
the King, and that they were not thought fit to be left there at the Head of
their Regiments, to be tempted with the advantage of joyning with any such Party.
At <i>Barbado</i>’s they staid till they had almost undone that Place by eating up their Provisions,
the Planters there seldom preparing more than they have occasion to spend
in their Houses, and for their Servants (having better and more profitable Employments
upon their Hands) and the Soldiers not being content with such Provisions
as their Servants would be well pleas’d with, so that they were in danger of starving
the Island and themselves too: Thereupon a Council of War was call’d, and
the necessity of leaving that Island declar’d, and Orders issu’d out to set Sail for
<i>Hispaniola</i>, where they might make such Attempt as their Condition would allow,
wanting Arms and other Necessaries; when they came within five or six Leagues
of <i>Hispaniola</i> the Fleet lay by, and a Council of War was call’d by the Commissioners
(for such they had who were never Soldiers) with some few Officers of the
Army, where it was resolv’d to attempt <i>San Domingo</i>, and an Order made, That in
case it be taken, no Soldier should offer to Plunder, but that satisfaction in lieu
thereof should be given by the Commissioners; the Officers of the Army in vain
opposing and protesting against it, which occasion’d the Soldiers to say, That the
Commissioners should take the Town themselves, for they would not; Lots were
there drawn by the several Colonels who should first Land, which fell upon the
Black Regiment, who had no Arms but Half-pikes of eight Foot long, made of
Cabbage-Tree in the <i>Barbado</i>’s; And Orders were then given out to the several
Colonels to Land at the River <i>Hind</i>, within two Leagues of <i>San Domingo</i>; so they
steer’d their Course thither, as was thought, by Night, but the next Morning found
themselves twenty Leagues at least from the place of Rendezvouz, though one Regiment
Landed there, who durst not attempt the Town for want of Orders, though
doubtless they might have taken it, had they not staid in expectation of the General
and the rest of the Fleet; but when they were thus cast Leeward of the Town,
they must Land their Men, who no sooner went on Shore, but the Order against
Plundering was read, and the Soldiers in a Mutiny to whom it was read, which
made the rest forbear to read it, judging it no time now to disoblige them, who
had in their Officers opinion too just a cause of discontent: However this was
made known to the rest, and discours’d as they march’d, That they had not thought
to be under a Committee here, but they would make them weary of their Employment
ere they had done: And this indeed was enough, besides the faintness
and unusual Heat of the Countrey, to disanimate Men of good Resolutions, especially
the ordinary Soldiers, whose hopes of Plunder is the chiefest prop to their
Courage, and expected Gain the spurr to their Valour. After they had Landed their
Men, next Morning early they march’d towards <i>San Domingo</i>; but before Noon
the Heat and Drought which they felt made them sensible of their first Errour and
Inadvertency, in coming from <i>England</i> without their Necessaries; for through want
of Bottles, which were left behind, and came not till three Moneths afterwards,
the Men fell down dead in the High-ways, every one fainting and languishing, and
crying out for Water: shortly after they met with a Field of Oranges, which was
no unwelcome sight, with which they stor’d themselves; but ere they had march’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>four or five Miles thought they had quench’d their present Thirst, and their
Drought began to increase however, they march’d on, leaving some of their
Men dead on the place, others fainting, were set upon the Troopers Horses till
they came that Night to some Water, which gave them new life, and the Morrow
early march’d again till they came within some Miles of the appointed Rendezvouz,
where they heard of the other Regiment that Landed at the right place: And
now having refresh’d themselves with Rest, Water, and Provision, they march’d
to the taking of the Town; the General himself, with a small Party and a Guide,
went towards the Town to find out some Water, which he knew the Soldiers
would want, (not having Bottles to carry any) but as they were on their March,
which was very leisurely by reason of the Heat, they heard a firing of Musquets,
then making more speed in their March, supposing an Engagement, in the Highway,
about a Mile from the Town, was found one of the General’s Secretaries,
with others, dead; and not long after some came back to the General, and told him,
That looking for Water with the Guide, an Ambuscade issu’d out, and had kill’d
the Guide that should have shew’d them the place of Water, and some others; and
although some which Commanded the foremost Regiments were very forward and
willing to assault the Town, yet it was not thought fit so to do till the Army came
up, by which time it was Night; and though they were then within half a Mile of
the Town, yet the Soldiers were so impatient for Water, that they could not stay
till the next Morning to assault the Town, but were forc’d to march back to the
River <i>Hind</i> about eight Miles; (and this Relater did at that time drink his own
Water) there they staid till they had again refresh’d themselves, and then prepar’d
for their Return to attaque the Town; and notwithstanding the March it self in a
hot Countrey was irksom enough, yet they were forc’d to make the Soldiers to
draw the Ordnance and other Carriages for want of Harness and other Necessaries,
which were left behind; however, they willingly underwent it by Turns: And
now a Forlorn was drawn out, and other Orders given for a March, especially it
being taken notice of, that the Enemies manner of Fight was and would be by Ambuscades,
a File in every Company were order’d to stand till the other came up,
and to face to the Right and Left to the Woods, which were all along as they went,
for fear of a Surprize; and the Forlorn marching near an old Fort, call’d <i>Jeronymo</i>,
which we had been possess’d of before, but thought not worth the keeping, and
fearing they might meet with some small opposition there, began to fortifie themselves,
and took a Dram of the Bottle, which as they were drinking, and others
eating a bit, suddenly rush’d forth an Ambush of about a hundred and twenty
<i>Blacks</i>, with a <i>Spanish</i> Commander in the Head of them, which so amaz’d and surpriz’d
them, that some few onely Discharging, the rest immediately fled; the <i>Blacks</i>
quickly falling in with their Lances, and doing such Execution as the time would
allow them; for presently the Alarm being taken, and Supplies marching out for
their relief, the Enemy, who had done more than they could possibly expect to
have done, retreated into their Fort, which they had better fortifi’d than before,
and had planted some small Drakes there upon it; the Execution was so short,
that they had not time either to strip or pick a Pocket, lest they had paid too dear
for it. After this Defeat a Council of War was call’d, and there it was agreed the
next Morning early to fall on upon that little Fort, and so proceed to the taking of
the Town; but very early, as they were in that expectation, Orders came from the
General to the Army to march back to the River <i>Hind</i>, for what reason this Relator
(though a considerable Person) never yet knew; where after they had staid some
time, that Miscarriage was question’d at a Council of War, and one of the chief
Officers of the Forlorn order’d to have his Sword broke over his Head, with other
disgraceful Impositions, and two Colonels of the Army were order’d to draw
up the Causes of this Miscarriage to send to <i>England</i>; which, because ’twas
thought would too much reflect on them in Power that were to supply them, was
by those Colonels judg’d inconvenient, and so ’twas never done. The number of
Men lost by Stragling, Sickness, and this unhappy Engagement, amounted in the
whole to about two hundred and thirty. In a short time after this, it was order’d
to Ship the Men; which done, after some Debates amongst the Commissioners
what was best to be done, Provisions nor Utensils yet coming fit for the Design intended,
which was to possess some considerable Place in the <i>Main</i>, it was agreed,
That they should steer their Course for the Island of <i>Jamaica</i>; which they did accordingly,
and on the tenth day of <i>May 1654.</i> with little opposition possess’d it:
where the same Soldiers have shew’d not onely such Courage and Resolution upon
all occasions, (in many and frequent Encounters and Invasions made by the <i>Spaniards</i>,
not onely with Soldiers of those Parts, but such as have been sent from <i>Spain</i>,
<i>Naples</i>, <i>Catalonia</i>, and other Places) as might speak them <i>English</i>-men but such hath
been their Patience and Sufferance, as none of this Nation in the memory of Man
have ever been put to, the Effects whereof their King and Countrey, ’tis hop’d,
will have occasion to remember, to their immortal Honor and Renown.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span><i>Hispaniola</i> is surrounded with several other Isles, as 1. Eastward appears <i>Saona</i>,
full of pleasant Woods and Pastures, with Cattel feeding on them: in former times

<h3 id='c327' class='c001'>CHAP. XIV.<br /> Porto Rico, and Monico.</h3>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Bounds and Extent of <i>Porto Rico</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Another of those call’d <i>The Isles of Barlovento</i>, is <i>Boriquen</i>, anciently so nam’d,
but now more generally <i>Porto Rico</i>, from <i>St. Juan de Porto Rico</i>, its chief Town,
is an Island fifteen Leagues distant from <i>Santa Crux</i>, to the North-West,
and about as many from <i>Hispaniola</i> to the South-East, but from the Continent or
main Land of <i>Paria</i> (which seems to be the nearest) a hundred and thirty, or a hundred
thirty six, as some reckon. It lieth almost in a quadrangular Form, being
suppos’d to contain about thirty Leagues in length, and not less than twenty in
breadth, in eighteen and nineteen Degrees of Northern Latitude.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Island on the North, which is less fruitful than the South part, produces
Gold, and is generally water’d with many Rivers. There is also Silver, Tin, Lead,
Quicksilver, and <i>Azure</i>, us’d by Painters. The Rain generally falls there between
<i>May</i> and <i>August</i>. A little before, or in the beginning of Harvest, the Hurricanes
breaking forth from the Clouds, rage in such a manner, that it is impossible for any
Ships to endure the Sea, and a Northern Blast generally doth great damage to the
Plants here.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sierra del Loquillo.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Ten Leagues towards the South-East beyond <i>Porto Rico</i>, appears <i>Sierra del Loquillo</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>being a continu’d Ridge of Mountains which runs through the whole Island
from East to West, extending both ways to the very Sea-shore.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_376.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Rivers.</div>

<p class='c010'>Twenty three Rivers discharge their Waters also into the Ocean; amongst which
the chiefest is <i>Cairabon</i>, particularly noted for ten Sugar-Mills which are erected
upon its Banks.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Trees.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Hills, Plains, and Valleys, are invested with variety of Trees peculiar to
this place, as <i>Tabunuco</i>, which affords a medicinal Gum, good against Lameness,
and green Wounds: it is also of great use to preserve a Ship’s Keel from the Worms.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another Tree call’d <i>Maga</i>, is everlasting Wood, and bears a great Flower like a
Rose.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Leaves of the <i>Higillo Pintado</i>-Tree cures all manner of Bruises.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same power is also in the little Tree <i>Sancta Maria</i>; as likewise in another
by the <i>Spaniards</i> call’d <i>Balsamo</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Body of the Tree <i>Zoyla</i> is so thick, that fifteen Men holding Hands together,
cannot encompass the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>The speckled Wood, and <i>Cassia Fistula</i> grow also here in great abundance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The poisonous Apple-Tree.</div>

<p class='c010'>Here is likewise Apple-Trees, which grow by Rivers sides, or on the Sea-shore,
whose Fruit is rank Poyson, and who-ever sleeps under the shadow of them, will
certainly be Lame: The Fruit eaten generally causes Death; or if Nature be so
strong in him that eats of it, to overcome the same, yet he is certain to lose his
Hair.</p>

<p class='c010'>As hurtful is the prickly Herb <i>Quibey</i>, which bears white Flowers like Violets.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Tree <i>Guiaba</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>But this Island receives the greatest prejudice by the Tree <i>Guaiaba</i>, because it
grows in most places, and over-runs Plains and Hills, so spoiling all the Grass, between
which and the fore-mention’d Tree there is such an antipathy, that none
will grow near it. The Tree bears a brown Apple full of Kernels, which are eaten
by Beasts and Fowls, and from which falling on the Ground when ripe, grow up
in new Trees, which makes the Countrey a meer Wilderness: The Body of it is
smooth and of a pale colour, the Leaves hard, and glittering, and grow two and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>two over one another; the Flowers have also five Leaves, in the middle of which
rises a Crown like that on a Peacock’s Head: The Fruit, which is cover’d with a
soft Doun, and somewhat longer than the <i>European</i> Apple, when cut through,
hath a pale red Pulp, full of eatable Kernels: before it is ripe, it is of a sharp taste,
yet good boyl’d, but when ripe, of a most delicious and pleasant rellish; nevertheless
too much of it causes a Lask: The Roots, which are red without, and white
within, are juicy, sweet, and very long, the Leaves sallow and sowre of taste.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Beast <i>Javaris</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Amongst the strange Beasts the <i>Javaris</i>, <i>Opassum</i>, and <i>Tatow</i> are the most remarkable.
The <i>Javaris</i> are taken for a sort of wild Hogs, and have short Ears and a
Navel on their Backs, little Tails, some black, and some spotted white.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Opassum</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Opassum</i> is as big as a Cat, hath a sharp Mouth, the upper Jaw-bone hanging
over the lower, long, straight, and broad Ears, and a very long Tail, bald at the end,
which winds in a Circle; on its Back black Hair sprinkled with grey Spots, and
with its sharp Claws climbs up the Trees, where it feeds on Fruit, and sometimes
preys on Fowls. Nature hath furnish’d this Beast with a strange Bag under its
Belly, whereof the in-side hath a far softer Doun than the out-side, in which the
young ones lie and suck, after which the Bag opening, they creep out upon the
Ground. The Males have also a Bag, which serves onely to carry their Young in,
for they and the Females carry them by turns.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Tatow</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Tatow</i>, which is arm’d with sharp Scales, hath the Mouth of a Hog, and at
each Foot five sharp Nails: when it is Hunted, or goes to sleep in the Night, it
draws its Head, Legs and Tail under its scaly Coat of Mail, like a Tortoise, and in
that manner lies secure against all manner of danger.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Venison taken here is very delicate, but difficult to be got; for this Beast
having a breathing-place in its Back, never tires with running, and when encompass’d
by the Dogs, falls valiantly on those that are nearest to it, and often tears
them in pieces.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chief Towns and Cities.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chief Towns in this Island, are 1. <i>Porto Rico</i> it self, commonly call’d
<i>St. John de Porto Rico</i> (so term’d by <i>Christopher Columbus</i>, as being the first Land discover’d
by him in the Year 1493. at that time when he could not perswade his Seamen,
wearied out with continual hardship, from returning, if they discover’d not
Land in two days) a strong and neat Town, built by the Command of <i>Philip</i> the
Second, King of <i>Spain</i>: It was attempted by Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> in the Year 1595.
without success, but a few years after taken by the Earl of <i>Cumberland</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>St. Germans</i>, in the West part of the Island, three or four Leagues distant from
the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>Arrecibo</i>, Westward from <i>Porto Rico</i>, where the most noted Haven is of those
Parts, for all the others are full of Rocks and Sands.</p>

<p class='c010'>The antient Inhabitants of this Island maintain’d continual Wars with the
Cannibals (probably the Natives of the Islands so call’d) who us’d every year to
come thither: those that were conquer’d, as well of the one side as of the other,
were eaten by the Conquerors, so that in effect, both sides were but a different sort
of Cannibals.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Columbus</i> Landing here, found a great House surrounded with twelve others, but
all of them empty and desolate.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Island (which formerly is said to have been under the absolute Power of
one sole King) the <i>Spaniards</i> not much regarded at first, having enough to do with
<i>Hispaniola</i>, where they found more Gold than on <i>Porto Rico</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The building of <i>St. Germans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Anno 1510.</i> <i>John Ponce de Leon</i> obtain’d a Commission from the Court of <i>Spain</i>, to
be chief Governor of this Island, and built <i>Caparra</i>, which Place was inhabited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>twelve years, notwithstanding it stood behind a scraggy Mountain, in a desart
place far up in the Countrey; but their thirst after Gold, of which some Veins
were discover’d there, made them dispence with all other inconveniences: yet at last
beginning to be weary of this desolate and barren place of Settlement, they remov’d
to <i>Guanica</i>, water’d by many Rivers, whose Sands had great quantities of Gold-dust.
Not staying long there, they went four Leagues farther, and call’d their
new Plantation <i>Soto Major</i>. Lastly, returning again, they setled themselves in the
former Valley <i>Guanica</i>, and built the fore-mention’d Town <i>St. Germans</i> by the River
<i>Guaorabo</i>, which makes an inconvenient Haven.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Situation, Description and Fate of <i>St. Juan de Porto Rico</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Juan de Porto Rico</i> stands Eastward at the beginning of the North Coast, on a small
<i>Peninsula</i>, joyn’d to the Island by an high <i>Isthmus</i> call’d <i>Puente de Aguilar</i>. Near the
Mouth of the Haven lies on a rising Hill the Fort <i>Morro Empinado</i>, built triangular
by <i>John de Texila</i> and <i>Baptista Antonelli</i> (who also planted there forty Guns), and surrounded
with the Sea, which renders it a well fortifi’d place. The Governor <i>Diego
Mendez de Valdez</i> had in it fifteen hundred Men and eighty Horses, when the fore-mention’d
valiant Duke of <i>Cumberland</i> with a far less number fell upon him in the
Year 1597. and not onely took the City <i>Porto Rico</i>, but several other Fortifications;
and besides an invaluable mass of Treasure he carried away eighty Guns. Sometime
before this Defeat the <i>Spaniards</i> under the Government of <i>Christopher</i>, Son to the <i>Portuguese</i>
Duke of <i>Camigna</i>, were Invaded by the Cannibals, and all that were then upon
the place utterly destroy’d, none of them escaping but the Bishop and his Servants,
who betimes fled away with the Church Ornaments; so that the Islanders
from that time were put out of doubt that the <i>Spaniards</i> were mortal, for they suppos’d
them immortal when first they saw their great Ships, and heard the noise of
their thundering Cannon.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Casique <i>Yaguara</i>’s Experiment.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Hugh Linschot</i> relates, That the Casique <i>Yaguara</i> threw a <i>Spaniard</i> into the Water,
to try whether he would drown or not, and seeing him wholly depriv’d of Life, he
concluded by consequence that the rest of them were mortal, and thereupon he set
upon them when they were seeking for Gold, and kill’d above a hundred and fifty
of them.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter Martyr</i> relates farther, That these People, though very expert in Arms, yet
were oftentimes beaten by the Cannibals, who at one time carried above five
thousand People out of <i>Porto Rico</i> for their Winter Provisions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Avarice and Cruelty of the <i>Spaniards</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Nor was their Condition better’d after the <i>Spaniards</i> conquer’d the Island, for those
that could not furnish them with Gold, were certain of Death: Nor were their
Cruelties in other places undivulg’d to this People before their Arrival; whereupon
(as is related by <i>Peter Ordonnez de Carellos</i>) the Casique <i>Hatvey</i> being inform’d
of the <i>Spaniards</i> Approach, took an Oath from his Subjects, That they should never
discover where the Gold lay, though they should be put to death for it; <i>For</i> (said
he) <i>Gold is their God, for which they make so many cursed Blood-baths where-ever they come;
therefore throw the Gold into some very deep Waters, for when the</i> Spanish <i>God is sunk, the</i>
Spaniards <i>will lose their Courage, and not plague us so much for it</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ceremonies of the old Natives.</div>

<p class='c010'>Many were the Idolatrous Ceremonies of the old Natives of this Place, which
would be too tedious to relate; but amongst the rest, they annually kept a great
Feast, at which the <i>Casiques</i> summon’d all their Subjects to a Temple appointed for
that purpose, where the Priests had prepar’d an Idol ready set forth in all its Pageantry;
near which the <i>Casique</i> plac’d himself, when upon the beating of a Drum
all the Commonalty came also into the Temple; the Men painted with divers Colours,
having on their Heads Plumes of Feathers, about their Necks, Legs, and
Arms, Strings of Sea-shells. The Married Women had a light Covering about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>their Middle, but the Maids went stark naked, all of them Dancing and Singing
Songs in praise of the Idol; after which having saluted the <i>Casique</i>, they thrust
little Sticks down their Throats, so to bring up all they had upon their Stomachs;
which done, and sitting down with their Legs under them, they began to Sing
anew, often bowing and shewing Reverence to the <i>Casique</i>; whilest some Women
carried Baskets of Bread amongst those that Sang, and utter’d certain Prayers, which
were answer’d by some of the Men; the Bread being bless’d by the Priests, they
gave every one a piece, with which they return’d home very merry and jocund.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the God of this Island, whoever he was, hath been a long time left
without Worshippers; for those that were left by the Invading Cannibals, were
cruelly massacred by the <i>Spaniards</i>, insomuch that they have been thereby necessitated
to furnish themselves with <i>Negro</i>’s to work in their Mines and Sugar-Mills;
and these also not able to endure such hard Entertainment, ran most of them away;
for when a <i>Negro</i> did not bring Gold enough home at Night, his Master tying him
naked to a Stake or Post, and beat him with Rods or Switches so long, till the
Blood ran down his Back, then pour’d boyling Oyl into the Wounds, and then
threw Pepper and Salt into them, and so let him lie, or else put him into a Pit, out
of which his Head appear’d onely. But those that fled gathering together, sometimes
met with the <i>Spaniards</i>, and paid them in their own Coin.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The Islands <i>Mona</i> and <i>Monico</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Eastward of <i>Porto Rico</i>, and betwixt it and <i>Hispaniola</i>, there lieth a little, but
fruitful Island call’d <i>Mona</i>; and Westward of that, another call’d <i>Monico</i>, or
<i>Monetta</i>; which last the <i>English</i>, when time was, found so admirably stor’d with a
sort of wild Fowl, that the huge Flights of them seem’d to darken the Air over their
Heads, and upon their Landing found such plenty of their Eggs upon the Shore
and Ground thereabouts, that they presently laded two of their Boats with them.
But how peopled or possess’d, not so well known.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its Bounds.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Westward, or rather to the North-West of <i>Hispaniola</i>, lieth <i>Cuba</i>, accounted
one of the four Isles of <i>Barlovento</i>, and by <i>Columbus</i>, upon his
first Discovery, call’d <i>Joanna</i>, afterwards <i>Fernandina</i>, then <i>Alpha</i> and
<i>Omega</i>, till at last the present Name prevail’d; it is parted from the other by a
Frith, or narrow Channel, which runneth betwixt the Capes of <i>St. Nicholas</i>, belonging
to <i>Hispaniola</i>, and that call’d <i>Mayzi</i>, belonging to <i>Cuba</i>: On the North it
hath a Frie of little Islands call’d <i>The Leucayæ Islands</i>, of which more in their proper
place, so many and so thick scatter’d, that they serve for no small Security and Defence
of the Island on that side; besides, a part of the <i>Peninsula</i> of <i>Florida</i>, which
Coasteth it likewise Northward; on the West it hath the Countrey of <i>Jucatan</i>,
which is part of the Continent, but at a distance of forty or fifty Leagues; and on
the South, <i>Jamaica</i>. It is reckon’d to be in length from Cape <i>Mayzi</i>, which looks
towards <i>Hispaniola</i> to the Cape of <i>St. Anthony</i>, which is upon the Bay of <i>Mexico</i>, two
hundred and thirty Leagues; but in breadth in some places not above fifteen or sixteen
Leagues over; in the broadest place from <i>Jardines</i> to <i>Lucanaca</i>, not above forty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>in others sixty five. But for fertility of Soil, contending with <i>Hispaniola</i> it self, and
for temperature and healthiness of Air, much exceeding it; nor less rich formerly
in good Mines both of Gold and Silver, and plentifully stor’d at present, not onely
with Sugar-Canes of the best Growth, but likewise with abundance of Ginger-Roots,
<i>Cassia-Fistula</i>, Mastick, Aloes, Cinamon, Long-Pepper of <i>America</i>, as they call
it, and divers other sorts of Spices. The Pastures no less abounding with Cattel of
all sorts, especially of <i>European</i> Breed; the Rivers and Coasts of the Sea with good
Fish; no scarcity of Fowl, whether wild or tame; good Brass and Iron still found,
with some Gold in the Rivers, especially those which fall into the Bay <i>Xagua</i> on
the South side of the Island; the chiefest thereof are <i>Arimao</i>, <i>La Luna</i>, <i>De Mares</i>,
and <i>Cauto</i>; the biggest of them falls Southward into the Sea; all of them breed
store of Crocodiles, which have oftentimes seiz’d both upon Men and Beasts, and
carrying them into the Water, devour’d them there.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Trees.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Cedars breathe forth a most excellent sweet smell, and grow so large, that
out of the single Trunks of some of them Boats are said to have been made, capable
to hold forty, sometimes sixty Men.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are also many other very odoriferous Trees, yielding a certain Rozen or
Gum, no less precious than the <i>Storax</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Birds.</div>

<p class='c010'>But nothing grows here more plentifully than Vines, the Bodies or Stocks of
which are as thick as a Man’s Middle, and bear excellent Grapes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides Partridges, Turtle-Doves, and other Fowl, the Sea-shore breeds thousands
of Cranes, which when young, are white, but when old, become of several
Colours; they stand commonly with their Legs in salt Water, which they drink.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Manner of taking Parrots.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Parrots which breed here us’d to be taken by the Natives after a strange
manner: A Boy having a Bundle of Herbs about his Head, climbs up to the top
of a Tree, holding a Parrot over his Head, which by griping he forces to make a
noise, and thereby draws others to come flying about him; upon which, being expert
in this Art, he throws a String with a Noose made fast to a Stick about them,
and pulls them to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are a sort of four-footed Serpents, by the Natives call’d <i>Yguanas</i>, of which
they us’d to eat.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Flesh of Tortoises or Turtles, was accounted a great Dainty amongst them,
especially those of the biggest size, of which some have been known to weigh a hundred
and thirty Pound: The Feet of them are said to cure the Leprosie and Scabs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amongst the peculiar Trees of this Countrey, are the <i>Zagua</i> and the <i>Caninga</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Cotton, which is of the natural Growth of this Place, is exceeding fine.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here is also the Bird <i>Flamingo</i>, and another sort of Bird call’d <i>Bambayas</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In former times <i>Cuba</i> was Govern’d by several Lords, each Commanding over
his own Province.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chief Provinces of <i>Cuba</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chiefest of these Provinces are <i>Mayzi</i>, <i>Bayamo</i>, <i>Cueyba</i>, <i>Camguey</i>, <i>Macaca</i>, <i>Xagua</i>,
<i>Habana</i>, and <i>Uhima</i>; some of them are plain, others mountainous, and being more
or less fruitful, were very populous, before the <i>Spaniards</i> came thither, but since their
cruel Massacres, scarce any of the antient Natives are left: Nor are the <i>Spaniards</i>
here at present very populous, considering the largeness of the Island.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Province of <i>Camaguey</i> is a Valley three Leagues in bigness, where Nature
produces a great number of large Stones so exactly round, that no Man with a
Compass can make a more exact Circle.</p>

<p class='c010'>Though the Gold, which is digg’d out of the Mines, and found in Rivers, is
none of the purest, yet the Copper which this Countrey affords is accounted excellent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Serpents.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>The Serpents here are about the bigness of a Hare, having Heads like Weezles;
they prey on little Beasts call’d <i>Guabiniquinazes</i>, and have been accounted delicious
and wholsom Meat.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Antient Customs of the Natives.</div>

<p class='c010'>The antient Natives went formerly naked. The Men made it a Custom to forsake
their Wives when they pleas’d; yet the Women were still oblig’d to be faithful
to them, though from the very first day of their Marriage they were taught to
Cuckold them, by a certain wicked Ceremony in use amongst them; for the
Bridegroom lay not with his Bride the first Night, but suffer’d her to be enjoy’d by
one of his Friends of equal Quality with himself, whether he were Lord, Merchant,
Laboring-man, or what Estate soever.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Spaniard</i> at first beaten by the Natives.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Island was reduc’d under the <i>Spanish</i> Government not without great effusion
of Blood; for the Natives having had continual Wars with the Cannibals, as
hath been said, were not ignorant in the Exercise of Arms. The first <i>Spanish</i> Commander
sent against them was <i>Valdivia</i>, whom they slew with all his Men, and hew’d
his Ship in pieces. Little better escap’d <i>Fogeda</i>, whose Men were all cut off, and
he himself escaping very miraculously, died not long after of his Wounds in
<i>St. Domingo</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>St. Jago</i> built by <i>Valasquez</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Within two years after, <i>viz.</i> <i>Anno 1514.</i> <i>Diego Velasquez</i> with better success set
forth for <i>Cuba</i>, where the first thing he did was to build a City, which he call’d
<i>St. Jago</i>, lying near a Southern Bay, full of Fish, and defended with several small
Isles, behind which the Ships in the greatest Storm may Ride very secure; by reason
whereof the new City increas’d so much, that in a short time it could shew
two thousand Inhabitants, a brave Church, a Cloyster, and was made a Bishop’s
See, but subordinate to that of <i>St. Domingo</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Copper Mountains.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>St. Jago</i> taken by the <i>English</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Three or four Leagues from the City are those famous Mountains, by the <i>Spaniards</i>
call’d <i>Sierra de Cobre</i>, or <i>The Copper Mountains</i>, from the abundance of that Metal
which the Mines in them afforded, and do yet afford; but the City was afterwards
almost left desolate, (divers Houses in the same standing empty) having in it
scarce two hundred Inhabitants; which made it the easier to be taken by a hundred
and sixty <i>English</i>-men, led by Captain <i>Cliff</i>, <i>Anno 1601.</i> who carried from thence
a hundred thousand Pieces of Eight, and a Ships Lading of Hides and Sugar.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Baracoa.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>2. Besides <i>St. Jago</i>, <i>Valasquez</i> built the Town <i>Baracoa</i>, on the Eastern Shore of <i>Cuba</i>,
wash’d by the River <i>Mares</i>, which falls into the Ocean between two Mountains on
one side, and a flat Point on the other, and is a most excellent Harbor: Not far
from which grows the best Ebony Wood.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>St. Salvador.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>3. He also built the Town <i>St. Salvador</i>, one of the most healthful Promontories
of all <i>Cuba</i>, near the River <i>Bayamo</i>, which produces round Stones, us’d there in stead
of Bullets.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Trinidad.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>4. He likewise built <i>Trinidad</i>, before which hardly accessible Harbor many a Ship
hath been cast away: But this Fort was by a mighty Storm levell’d even with the
Ground.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Puerto del Principe.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>5. Near the Haven before the Town <i>Puerto del Principe</i> is a Fountain, out of
which at certain times flows liquid Pitch.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Villa Sancti Spiritus.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>6. The Town call’d <i>Villa Sancti Spiritus</i>, six Leagues from the Ocean, boasts
fifty brave Houses, and is wash’d by the River <i>Saaz</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Havana.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>7. The chiefest City which the <i>Spaniards</i> possess in the <i>West-Indies</i>, and the present
Seat of their Governor, is <i>Christovall de Havana</i>; which stood first on the South
side of <i>Cuba</i>, but was afterwards built on the North, opposite to <i>Florida</i>: The Harbor
before it is large and safe, for it is able to contain a thousand Ships, without
the least endangering of one another, and yet the Entrance so narrow, between a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>Promontory and a square Fort, that two Ships cannot Sail in together: the shallowest
part thereof hath six Fathom Water. On each side the Mouth of the Harbor
is a Fort, the one call’d <i>Mesa de Maria</i>, which stands built on a Champain
Ground; the other call’d <i>Morro</i>, which lies at the Foot of two Hills, on whose
tops several Guns are planted, which Command the Town and Haven.</p>

<p class='c010'>Betwixt these two Forts is a Tower cover’d, on the top whereof is a round Lantern,
wherein stands continually a Watch-man, who puts forth as many Flags as he
discovers Ships at Sea, to give notice thereof to the City, which is a Mile from
thence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before <i>Havana</i> stands a third Castle, well stor’d with Guns, as likewise the rest
are, in all to the number of two hundred and forty, and strongly Garrison’d; of
which great care was taken by the General <i>Jean de Texeda</i>, and <i>Baptista Antonelli</i>, an
Architect, sent thither by <i>Philip</i> the Second, King of <i>Spain</i>, to secure the Place from
all foreign Assaults, because the Plate-Fleet, and other Ships that come out of the
<i>West-Indies</i>, have their place of Rendezvouz here, and from hence set Sail altogether
for <i>Spain</i>. The City stands along the Haven, and hath two Churches with
spiry Steeples. The Houses are now built after the <i>Spanish</i> manner.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Havana</i> several times Assaulted and taken.</div>

<p class='c010'>But <i>Havana</i> was not so strongly fortifi’d in former times, for <i>Anno 1536.</i> it could
not resist a mean <i>French</i> Pyrate, who losing the rest of his Fleet was driven hither
by Storm, and conquering <i>Havana</i>, had burnt the same, consisting at that time of
woodden Houses cover’d with Thatch, had not the <i>Spaniards</i> redeem’d them from
the Fire for seven hundred <i>Ducats</i>; with which Money the <i>French</i> set Sail, when
the day following three Ships arriv’d from <i>New Spain</i> before <i>Havana</i>, and having
unladed their Goods, and preparing themselves for Battel, pursu’d the Pyrate;
whom getting sight of, the Admiral, who Sail’d before, durst not venture to Engage
him alone, but staid for the other two Ships: from which cowardly Action
the <i>French</i> Pyrate taking Courage, fell on the <i>Spanish</i> Admiral, who without firing
a Gun ran his Ship ashore, and deserted the same: the next Ship thereby discourag’d
Tacking about, made away from the Enemy; on which the third also follow’d,
insomuch that at last they were all three taken by the <i>French</i>; who encourag’d
with this unexpected Victory, steer’d their Course a second time to <i>Havana</i>,
where they got as much more Money from the Inhabitants as before. After this
the <i>Spaniards</i> built all their Houses of Stone, and a Fort at the Mouth of the Harbor,
yet nevertheless the City lay open on the Land side; of which the <i>English</i> Fleet,
Cruising about in those Seas, being inform’d, Landed not far from <i>Havana</i>, and enter’d
the City before Day-break: the <i>Spaniards</i> thus suddenly surpriz’d, fled into the
Woods, whilest the <i>English</i> plunder’d and ransack’d the City without any resistance.
But this was not the last Blow which <i>Havana</i> receiv’d, for during the Wars between
the Emperor <i>Charles</i> the Fifth, and the <i>French</i> King <i>Henry</i> the Second, a Ship set Sail
with ninety Soldiers from <i>Diep</i> to <i>Cuba</i>, where they made themselves Masters of
<i>St. Jago</i>, and carried great Treasure away with them: Thus enrich’d, they set in
the Night on <i>Havana</i>, but found their Expectations frustrated, for all the Houses
were empty, the <i>Spaniards</i> (being so often Plunder’d) having remov’d all their
Goods to their Countrey Houses, which lay scattering about the Island. Whilest
the <i>French</i> were searching the Houses, two <i>Spaniards</i> came under pretence of agreeing
with them, but their Design was chiefly to take an Account of their Enemies
Forces. The <i>French</i> demanded six thousand <i>Ducats</i> of them: to which the two
<i>Spaniards</i> reply’d, That all their Goods would not raise so much: then going to
their Party, inform’d them of the number of the Enemies, and their Demands;
whereupon Consulting, some judg’d it best to comply with a forc’d Necessity, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>if they could not get any thing abated, to pay the demanded Sum: but most of
them were of another opinion, alledging, That the number of the <i>French</i> was not
equivalent to their Demands, and that it would not be for their Credit, to yield
up their Estates so tamely, without trying their Title by the Sword: This being
judg’d fittest, they march’d to Engage them with a hundred and fifty Men, which
about Midnight fell on the <i>French</i>, and at the first Onset slew four of them; but upon
the firing of the Gun they were all alarm’d, and after a small Skirmish, put the
<i>Spaniards</i> to flight. The Conquerors enrag’d at this treacherous Plot of the <i>Spaniards</i>,
set fire on <i>Havana</i>, in which at that time was a good quantity of Pitch and
Tarr; with which the Gates, Windows, Roofs, and Pent-houses being all bedaub’d
over, were in few hours all in a light Flame; after which the Churches in order
for their firing, were also going to be over-laid with the same combustible Matter;
at which a <i>Spaniard</i> boldly desir’d, that the Temples erected for Gods Service
might be spar’d: to which he was answer’d, That People who keep not their
Promise, nor had any Faith, had no need of Churches to profess their Faith in.
The <i>French</i> not satisfi’d with burning, pull’d down the Walls, and utterly demolish’d
the Fort.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Haven <i>Xagua</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Haven <i>Xagua</i> also is not inferior to any, the Mouth thereof being a Boweshot
wide, and within, ten Leagues: The Ships are securely shelter’d behind three
Islands, and also the Mountains, which rise along the Shore.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Success of Admiral <i>Peter Hein</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, the Inlet <i>Matanca</i> is not onely eminent, by reason of the round Mountain
<i>Elan de Matancas</i>, which rises from a low Ground; but chiefly for the Expeditions
of Admiral <i>Peter Peterson Hein</i>, who being sent out by the <i>West-India</i> Company,
to Cruse up and down before <i>Havana</i> with one and thirty Sail, was from
thence by a strong Current driven down to <i>Matanca</i>; where he stood from the
Shore, when ten Ships came just running amidst his Fleet, and were all taken but
one: About Noon they discover’d nine Ships more, which Sailing along the
Shore, got into the Inlet <i>Matanca</i>, where they ran aground; whither <i>Hein</i> following,
came up to them the next Morning by Break-of-day, and after a small Resistance
took them, being valu’d to be worth above a hundred and fifteen Tun of
Gold, besides the Musk, Ambergreece, and <i>Bezoar</i> with which two other Ships
were laden, and another rich Prize.</p>

<p class='c010'>This large Island <i>Cuba</i> (as we have before observ’d) formerly divided into so
many populous Territories, is now in a manner desolate; for according to the
<i>Spaniards</i> Relation to the Admiral <i>Henry Jacobson Lucifer</i>, when he was before <i>Havana</i>,
<i>Cuba</i> had upon it not above sixty thousand Persons in all, in <i>Anno 1627.</i> But
who-ever Reads that which Bishop <i>Bartholomeo de las Casas</i> hath written in his Book,
(Printed first in <i>Sivill</i> in the <i>Spanish</i> Tongue, and afterwards, with the King of
<i>Spain</i>’s leave, in <i>French</i> at <i>Antwerp</i>) will easily find the reason, why <i>Cuba</i> and
many other <i>Indian</i> Countreys lie so desolate; and how sensible the <i>Indians</i> were of
the <i>Spaniards</i> usage, appears by this following Story, related by the said Bishop, of
a <i>Casique</i> call’d <i>Hathuey</i>, who before the <i>Spaniards</i> approach’d his Countrey, <i>Anno 1511.</i>
fled from <i>Hispaniola</i> to <i>Cuba</i>; where afterwards he was taken by the <i>Spaniards</i>, and
condemn’d to be burnt alive with green Wood: whilest he was tying to a Stake,
a <i>Franciscan</i> Monk Preach’d to him the Mysteries of the <i>Christian</i> Religion, of which
he had never heard; and likewise that he should ascend up to Heaven if he dy’d in
that Belief; but if not, burn perpetually in Hell: Whereupon <i>Hathuey</i> asking the
<i>Franciscan</i>, If there were any <i>Spaniards</i> in Heaven? and being told there were, answer’d,
<i>I will rather converse amongst the Devils in Hell, than amongst the</i> Spaniards, <i>whose
Cruelty is such, that none can be more miserable than where</i> Spaniards <i>are</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>Before we conclude the Description of <i>Cuba</i>, it will be material to add some
Passages of a Letter from Major <i>Smith</i>, Governor of the Isle of <i>Providence</i>, who was
taken there in the Year 1665. which will give light to the knowledge of the present
State, not onely of <i>Cuba</i>, but of some other parts of <i>America</i>, belonging to the
<i>Spaniards</i>; which is as followeth:</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Maj. <i>Smith</i>’s Letter concerning <i>Cuba</i> and other Parts.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Cuba</i> is a very good Island, and in it is generally the best Land, for so large a
Countrey, as I have seen in <i>America</i>, although I have travell’d the main Continent
in several places, and have cross’d from the North Sea to the South Sea, as
also the North side of <i>Hispaniola</i>, and most parts of <i>Jamaica</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This great Island is easie to be conquer’d, and would make the best Plantation,
besides the prejudice it would be to the <i>Spaniard</i>, and the great advantage to our
Nation; for instance, Had we the Port and City of <i>Havana</i>, which might in all
probability be reduc’d with two Regiments of good Soldiers from <i>Jamaica</i>, carrying
with them two or three Sloops or Shallops for Landing Men, fitted with good
Arms and other Necessaries for an Assault, presently after their Armado hath pass’d
out of the <i>Indies</i>, which is once in two years, towards the latter part of the Summer.
There is good Landing on the West side of the City, where it lies open; and you
need fear no Ambuscado’s: but not on the East side on the Harbor, for there you
will be gawl’d by the strong Castle of the <i>Moare</i>, until the City be secur’d; but
when that is once taken, you may easily reduce that Castle also, there being no
danger of their re-taking it, until the next Armado arrives there, which will be almost
two years, against which time you will have Planters enough from other of
our Islands, to Manure the Land, and assist the Soldiers in defence thereof: This
once effected, would utterly ruine the <i>Spaniards</i>, for these Reasons: Our Ships lying
both here and at <i>Jamaica</i>, would be at all times ready to gather up their stragling
Fleet, which it is difficult to keep imbodied without the help of that Port of <i>Havana</i>,
it being impossible for their great unruly Ships to turn up to Windward from
the Bay of <i>Mexico</i>, or <i>Puerto Bello</i>, without separation; and on the other side, to
pass the Gulf of <i>Florida</i>, is for them as impossible, where they always Rendezvouz,
Victual, Water, and provide all things necessary for their Return into <i>Spain</i>; after
all which they diligently wait for a convenient Season of Winds and Weather (being
much observ’d from the Changes of the Moon) when to pass that dangerous
<i>Straight</i>: for to say truly, the <i>Spaniards</i> are neither very fit for Sea nor Land-Service,
excepting some Officers and Soldiers bred in <i>Flanders</i> for Land-Service, and a few
<i>Biscainers</i> for Sea-Affairs. They are so sensible of their Weakness, and jealous of
their Riches in those Parts, that it is very difficult for any ingenious Man to get his
Liberty, being once taken, fearing he might give such Intelligence, as to be thereby
the cause of their ruine, witness their blind-folding of all Strangers, when they pass
their Cities and Castles; for they much dread an old Prophecy amongst them, <i>viz.</i>
<i>That within a short time the</i> English <i>will as freely walk the Streets of</i> Havana, <i>as the</i> Spaniards
<i>now do</i>; which indeed had been easily perform’d with a third part of the
<i>English</i> Army sent to <i>Jamaica</i>, and a far greater advantage to the Nation: for I esteem
that Port and Harbor of <i>Havana</i> in the <i>West-Indies</i>, equivalent (against that Nation)
to <i>Tangier</i> in the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Gibraltar</i>; and if we were at once Masters of both, it
would without doubt so straiten the <i>Spaniards</i>, as absolutely to admit us a free
Trade into their Ports of <i>America</i>, where they impart our Commodities, and sell
them for ten times more than they first cost in <i>Spain</i>, by reason of the great plenty
of Silver: which Trade would not onely be of infinite advantage to us, but also
prevent them of their future enslaving of our Nation in Chains as now they do;
for being employ’d about their Fortifications, they are worse us’d, all things consider’d,
than if they were taken by the <i>Turks</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>I have seen other parts of the <i>West-Indies</i>, where the <i>Spaniards</i> might be fleec’d of
considerable quantities of Riches, as at <i>Panama</i>, where their Silver Bars lie pyl’d up
in Heaps in the open Streets Day and Night without Guard for five or six Moneths
together, waiting the arrival of the Armado; which when arriv’d in <i>Puerto Bello</i>,
they Transport it thither with so slender a Guard, for so great a Treasure, as would
be an easie Prey to a thousand resolv’d Men (although of extraordinary value for
so small a Charge;) but here is no resting, nor long remaining, they being so
numerous (as in all other places of the main Land) though of great Wealth, and
easily gotten with a Catch and away: But to my purpose,</p>

<p class='c010'>This Island of <i>Cuba</i> hath adjacent to it great Conveniences of Salt and Fishing;
and in it are very great plenty of Horses, Neat, Sheep, and Hogs, both wild and
tame, of a far larger and better breed than any other parts of <i>America</i>: It hath also
many very rich Mines of Copper already open, and is the onely Place that supplies
all the <i>West-Indies</i> with Metal for the infinite number of Ordnance they have
in all their Ports and Castles, both in the North and South Seas; but whether it
hath any Mines of Silver or Gold, I know not; but if there were any such, they
would not adventure their opening and discovery, fearing the Invasion of that
Island, whereunto is so easie access by Sea, and of so great import to their whole
Interest in <i>America</i>: for which reason also they refuse to work any Mines in <i>Florida</i>,
that are nigh the North Sea, (although they have there very many) but do rather
employ themselves about others farther up in the Countrey, although with
greater Labor and Cost, for conveyance of the Product by Land to <i>Mexico</i>. And
lastly, (for its full praise) this Island hath many very good Ports and Harbors of
great advantage to Ships, for safe passing the Gulf; and should the <i>Spaniards</i> keep
three or four Frigats always plying between the Western end of <i>Cuba</i> and that of
<i>Havana</i>, off and on, it were impossible for any Ships of ours that came from <i>Jamaica</i>
to escape them; the Scales turn’d would be their Case to all <i>America</i>. Neither
wants it great Sugar-works, which have Water-mills and Horse-mills, and very
many large <i>Cocoa</i> Walks, the most and best Tobacco: and in short, it produceth
all other Commodities, that any of our <i>American</i> Islands have knowledge of.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Extent of <i>Jamaica</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The Island of <i>Jamaica</i> lieth North from the Southern Continent of <i>America</i>,
in the Sea call’d <i>Mare del Nort</i>; and South from the Isle of <i>Cuba</i> about
twelve Leagues; and West from <i>Hispaniola</i> twenty, in eighteen Degrees
of Northern Latitude; and beareth from <i>Rio de Hacha</i> North-West, a hundred and
fifty Leagues; from <i>Santa Martha</i> North North-West, a hundred and thirty five;
from <i>Rio Grande</i> North-West, a hundred and thirty; from <i>Carthagena</i> North, fourteen;
from <i>Porto Bello</i> North-East and by North, a hundred and ninety; from the
Bay of <i>Darien</i>, North and by East, a hundred and seventy; from the Bay of <i>Mexico</i>,
a hundred and fifty. It is of Form something nearly resembling oval, being in
length from East to West, about fifty four Leagues, or a hundred and seventy Miles;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>from North to South in the broadest and middlemost part, about three and twenty
Leagues, or seventy Miles over, and so groweth narrower and narrower towards
each Extream; in circumference about one hundred and fifty Leagues, or four
hundred and fifty <i>English</i> Miles.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nature of the Country.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Island is well water’d with Springs and Rivers, and is all over, especially
in the Western parts, full of high Hills and Mountains: It is also well Wooded;
for the North and South parts chiefly abound with tall and large Woods: Nor are
there wanting every where <i>Savanas</i>, or Pastures, which are thought to have been
Fields of <i>Indian Maiz</i>, till the <i>Spaniards</i> arriving here, brought in Horses, Cows,
Hogs, and <i>Asinego</i>’s to feed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Temperature of the Air.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Air in this Place is more temperate, and the Heat more tolerable, than in
any of the rest of the <i>Barloventi</i>, by reason of the cool Breezes which constantly blow
from the East, and the frequency of Showers of Rain, and refreshing Dews which
fall in the Night.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is also the onely Island of the <i>Barloventi</i>, which is not subject to violent
Storms and Hurricanes; and the Diseases which are predominant here, are onely
bred by Intemperance, as Surfets, Feavers, and Agues, or occasion’d by ill Diet or
Slothfulness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Commodities of the Island.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Commodities of this Island are very many; and first for Vegetables, the
Sugars are so good, that they now out-sell those of <i>Barbado</i>’s 5 <i>s.</i> <i>per Cent.</i></p>

<p class='c010'><i>Cocoa</i>, of which there are many large Walks; and greater plenty by improvement
may easily be produc’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tobacco, so good, that the Merchants give Six pence a Pound for it, and buy it
faster than the Planters can make it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Indigo is producible in great abundance, if there were Hands sufficient employ’d
about it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Cotton of this Place is accounted very firm and substantial, and preferr’d
before any that grows in the neighboring Islands.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of Tortoise-shell there is also good store, by reason that much of that sort of
Tortoise is taken on this Coast.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here are also great variety of Dye-woods, as <i>Brasiletto</i>, <i>Fustwick</i>, Red-wood, a
kind of Log-wood, and several others, besides divers of those that are accounted
the most curious and rich sorts of Woods, as Cedar, <i>Mohogeney</i>, <i>Lignum-vitæ</i>, Ebony,
<i>Granadilla</i>, and others, which are frequently Exported.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, there are very probable testimonies, that there are Mines of Copper
here, since both there have been those who affirm to have seen the Oar wrought
out of one of them, and the <i>Spaniards</i> report the Bells that hang in the great Church,
to have been Cast out of this Island Copper. As for Silver, the <i>English</i> are said to
have been shew’d a Silver-Mine behind the Mountains, West of <i>Cagway</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ambergreece the <i>Spaniards</i> report to have been often found on this Coast.</p>

<p class='c010'>Salt might be made here in great abundance, there being three good Salt-pans;
and Salt-petre hath been found in many Parts.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ginger is reported to grow better here than in most of the <i>Caribbee</i> Islands; and
Cod-pepper very plentifully; and also a certain kind of Spice call’d <i>Piemete</i>, being
in the form of <i>East-India</i> Pepper, of a very aromatical and curious taste, partaking
as it were of divers species together: it grows wild in the Mountains, and is very
highly valu’d amongst the <i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of Drugs and medicinal Plants there is here a very great abundance, as <i>Guaiacum</i>,
<i>China</i>-Root, <i>Cassia-Fistula</i>, <i>Veuillard</i>, <i>Achiotes</i>, <i>Tamarinds</i>, <i>Contrayerva</i>, <i>Ciperas</i>, <i>Adiantum
Nigrum</i>, <i>Aloes</i>, <i>Cucumis Agrestis</i>, <i>Sumach</i>, <i>Acacia</i>, <i>Misselto</i>, with several others,
both Drugs, Balsoms and Gums.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span><i>Cochinele</i> is produc’d by a Plant that grows in this Countrey, but it is not made
without much care and curiosity, and the <i>English</i> are not yet well experienc’d in
the Husbanding thereof, besides that the Growth of the Plant is much obstructed
by Easterly Winds.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Beasts.</div>

<p class='c010'>There is here greater store of Cattel than in any of the rest of the <i>English</i> Plantations
in <i>America</i>, as Horses, which by reason of the great number of them, are
bought very cheap.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cow’s, of a large size, and of which vast numbers are yearly kill’d.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Asinego</i>’s and Mules, both wild and tame, being a very serviceable sort of Cattel
in those Countreys.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sheep, large and tall, and whose Flesh is counted exceeding good, but the Fleece
worth little.</p>

<p class='c010'>Goats in great abundance, being a sort of Cattel very peculiar to that Countrey.</p>

<p class='c010'>But of all other Cattel, Hogs are here in the greatest plenty, both wild in the
Mountains, and tame in the Plantations; and they are more in request for Food
than any of the rest, their Flesh being counted both of a better rellish, and more easily
digestible than the Hogs-flesh of our Parts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fish.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Fish that is very plentifully caught in these Coasts is of infinite variety, and
quite of another kind from what we have in this part of the World, the principal
whereof is the Tortoise, which is taken in great abundance both on these Coasts,
and in the Islands <i>Camavas</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Birds.</div>

<p class='c010'>The tame Fowl in this Place, are chiefly Hens, Turkies, and Ducks; but of
wild Fowl infinite store, as of <i>Guinee</i> Hens, <i>Flamingo</i>’s, Teal, Ducks, Wigeon, Geese,
Pigeons, Snipes, Plovers, Parrots, Turtles, Parachites, Machaw’s, with divers
others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fruit-Trees and other Plants.</div>

<p class='c010'>Choice and excellent sorts of Fruits are here in great abundance, as <i>Cocao</i>-Nuts,
<i>Mannes</i>, <i>Maumees</i>, <i>Supatas</i>, <i>Suppotillias</i>, <i>Avocatas</i>, <i>Cashuds</i>, Prickle-Apples, Pickle-Pears,
Sower-Sops, <i>Custud</i>-Apples, and many others.</p>

<p class='c010'>For Timber-Trees, <i>Platanes</i> and Pines.</p>

<p class='c010'>And for Garden-Herbs, Radish, Lettice, Parsley, Cucumbers, Melons, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>The antient Inhabitants us’d two sorts of Bread, the one made of stamp’d
Roots, and the other of Corn, which is Reap’d thrice every year, and grows with
such success, that one Pint sow’n yields two hundred.</p>

<p class='c010'>They had a strange way to make their <i>Cazari</i> Cakes of the Root <i>Juca</i>, which
keep good a year: They first press’d out the Juice with great Weights, which if
drunk raw, occasions sudden Death; but boyl’d, is pallatable and good.</p>

<p class='c010'>Potato’s are here in great abundance, and grow like Artichokes in a moist Soil,
and shoot forth Leaves of a dark-green Colour, like Spinage; they spread upon
the Earth by Stalks, and bear a Flower like a Bell, at the end of which grows the
Seed: the Roots are generally White, but sometimes Red, Marble-colour’d, Yellow,
and Violet; they are not onely pleasing to the Pallat, but accounted very
wholsom when stew’d in a close cover’d Pot, with a little Water.</p>

<p class='c010'>But much daintier are the <i>Ananas</i>, which grow on a Stalk of a Foot long, surrounded
with sixteen large sharp Leaves, between which grows a Fruit like a Pine-Apple,
but much bigger, with an uneven Rind, of a pale Green, and inclining to a
Carnation on a yellow Ground; on the top shoots out a red Bunch of Leaves and
Flowers; the innermost Pulp melts on the Tongue, and is of so delicious a taste,
that it exceeds all other Dainties; the Seed produces Fruit once.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of this Fruit there are several sorts, the chief whereof is accounted a special Remedy
against a bad Stomach, Gravel, Poyson, and Melancholy.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>The Drink made of <i>Ananas</i> is no way inferior to <i>Malvasia</i> Wine.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A sort of sensitive Plant.</div>

<p class='c010'>Here you may observe a remarkable Secret of Nature in a certain ever-green
Plant, which grows either on the Bodies of old Trees, on the Rocks, or in the
Woods; the Stalk whereof surrounded with Leaves, full of dark red Spots, bears a
sweet-smelling Violet-colour’d Flower, the Leaves whereof as soon as touch’d,
close up together and die, and according as they are held in the Hand a shorter or
longer time, this strange alteration continues.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ginger.</div>

<p class='c010'>Since the <i>Spaniards</i> planted Ginger on <i>Jamaica</i>, it hath grown there in great abundance;
the Male Plant (for it is divided into Male and Female) hath generally
bigger Leaves than the Female; the Stalks, which are without Knots, have more
Leaves upwards than downwards, and spreads along the Earth, still take Root
anew; when the Leaves wither, then the Ginger is commonly ripe, but it hath
not that poinancy whilest green as when dry’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cotton.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Cotton of this Island (of which the Clothes and Hammocks that are made,
are vended in most parts of the Western World) grows on a Tree of equal heighth
with a Peach-Tree, with a straight Stem or Body, out of which shoot Boughs of an
equal length, and at equal distance; between the Leaves, which are narrow and
long, grow red Flowers, and from them, oval Cods, which when ripe, inclose the
Cotton, and a Seed like Pepper.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the <i>Alligator</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Of hurtful Creatures here, besides the <i>Manchonele</i>, and a sort of Snakes call’d
<i>Guaana</i>’s, wherein ’tis thought there is little or nothing of a poysonous quality;
the most observable is the <i>Alligator</i>, with which many Rivers and Ponds abound;
it is a very voracious Creature, but is seldom known to prey upon a Man; it moves
swiftly and strongly forward, but turns slow; the biggest of them are about twenty
Foot long, their Backs scaly and impenetrable, so that they are hardly kill’d but in
the Belly or Eye; they have four Feet or Fins, with which they go or swim indifferently;
are observ’d to make no kind of noise; their usual course for getting
their Prey, is to lie on their Backs as dead, then with a sudden onset to surprize
what-ever Fowl or Beast comes fearlesly near them; the best caution other Creatures
have of them is from the strong smell that flows from their Bodies: to requite
the harm done by them, they have something of vertue, for the Fat or Oyl of
their Bodies hath been experienc’d to be an admirable Ointment for all kinds of
Pains and Aches; they Lay Eggs no bigger than a Turkies by the Water side, still
covering them with Sand, which heated by the Sun-beams, hatcheth the young
ones, who naturally creep into the Water.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Muschilli</i> and <i>Merrywings</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>In some parts of the Countrey there are also a sort of stinging Flies, call’d <i>Muschilli</i>
and <i>Merrywings</i>, but the <i>English</i> Quarters are little infested by them.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Hugh Linschot</i> writes, That the antient Natives of this Place were a subtile and
sharp-witted People, skilful in Handicrafts, and expert in warlike Affairs, above
all the <i>Americans</i> besides.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First Discovery of the Island.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Island was discover’d by the <i>Spaniards</i> under the Conduct of <i>Columbus</i>, who
first built there the Town of <i>Mellilla</i>; which disliking, he remov’d again to <i>Oristana</i>;
and finding that an incommodious and unhealthy Situation, he remov’d again to
another Plantation, where he built a very fair Town, first call’d <i>Sevilla</i>, afterwards
<i>St. Jago de la Vega</i>, consisting of about seventeen hundred Houses, two Churches, two
Chappels, and an Abbey, being the chief, if not the onely Seat of the <i>Spaniards</i> before
the arrival of the <i>English</i>, for their <i>Estanchas</i>, or small Plantations, were committed
wholly to the custody of their Slaves.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Diego</i>, the Son of <i>Christopher Colonus</i>, (or, as he is vulgarly call’d, <i>Columbus</i>) was
the first that was constituted Governor of this Island, and sent <i>Juan de Squibello</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>Commander, who upon their first arrival here committed such horrid Cruelties
and Massacres, that (as the fore-mention’d <i>Bartholomeo de las Casas</i> writes) five thousand
Inhabitants were in a short time reduc’d to less than three hundred, multitudes
being put to death in a most inhumane and barbarous manner, some roasted alive,
others torn in pieces by the <i>Spanish</i> Dogs, besides many other studied ways of Butchery,
too dreadful to be read with patience; nor were they free from Civil War
amongst themselves, which first began in this Island.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Attempts of the <i>English</i> upon his Island.</div>

<p class='c010'>The first and onely Attempters upon this Island since the <i>Spaniards</i> made themselves
Masters thereof, have been the <i>English</i>, who in the Year 1592. under the Conduct
of Sir <i>Anthony Shirley</i> Landed upon it, &amp; got clear possession thereof, none of the
<i>Spaniards</i> that were then upon the Place daring to make the least resistance; but not
thinking it worth the keeping, they soon deserted it, and made Sail back again for
<i>England</i>: after which they remain’d unmolested for a long time, till in the Year
1654. a Fleet of <i>English</i> was set out for <i>Hispaniola</i> by <i>Cromwell</i>, under the Command
of Colonel <i>Venables</i>, with a Design for the taking of <i>St. Domingo</i>; but meeting with
ill success in the Enterprize, and being forc’d to quit that Island with loss of Men,
and frustration of their hopes, they steer’d their Course for <i>Jamaica</i>, and on the
tenth of <i>May</i> in the Year abovesaid, with little opposition possess’d themselves of it.
Upon their approach to <i>St. Jago</i> the Inhabitants thereof deserted it, and betook
them to the Mountains, gaining time by a pretence of Treaty, to secure their Women
and Goods; and oftentimes making Incursions upon the stragling Parties of
the <i>English</i>, slew and took many Prisoners by surprize: but being weary of this
wild and irregular kind of living, they betake themselves at last to the Isle of <i>Cuba</i>,
where many of them, the Grandees especially, were permitted by favour to continue,
the rest being by the Vice-Roy commanded back, with promise of speedy
and considerable Supplies; by that time this remnant of the <i>Spaniards</i> was near
tir’d out with hardship and necessity, some being very much discourag’d and driven
to utter despondence of Mind, others destroy’d out-right, part of the long promis’d
and expected Supply arrives, the greatest part being to follow soon after; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>finding the Islanders so few in number, and in so sickly and necessitous an Estate,
they would not joyn with them, but maugre all the Governor’s Perswasions or
Commands, retreat to the North part of the Island, and there fortifie at a place
call’d <i>Chireras</i>, expecting every day fresh Recruits; which not coming time enough,
and their Quarters being discover’d, they were set upon by the <i>English</i>, and most
of them either slain or taken Prisoners: not many Moneths after the rest of the
<i>Spanish</i> Forces Land, being in all about thirty Companies, with Ordnance and
good store of Ammunition; who falling presently to make strong Fortifications
at <i>Rio Novo</i>, are nevertheless in a short time utterly defeated by the
<i>English</i>: Upon which, and several other ill Successes, despairing to re-gain the
Island, they Ship off their Women and the richest of their Goods; and the <i>Negro</i>
Slaves grown Masterless, by the general either slaughter or departure of their Patrons,
shake off their Obedience to the <i>Spaniards</i>, and constitute a Governor of their
own, a <i>Black</i>, yet submit themselves, and own Subjection to the <i>English</i> Government,
the <i>Spaniards</i> from <i>Cuba</i>, both by their Perswasions and monethly Contributions,
in vain endeavoring to reduce them; onely some few there were that stood
out, whom the rest not onely made it their business to discover, but help’d the <i>English</i>
to take them, insomuch that at last the <i>Spanish</i> General not having above fifty
Men left him, was forc’d to seek for Peace, and offer’d Terms of Accommodation;
which the <i>English</i> General would not be drawn to accept of, unless upon Condition
that he should deliver up to Justice as many as were left of those that had
barbarously murder’d any of our Men, either in time of Treaty, or after Quarter
given.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>English</i> in this Island are setled for above a hundred Miles along the Countrey
from the Eastward.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chief Towns.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their chief Towns are 1. <i>St. Jago</i>, (built by the <i>Spaniards</i>, as afore mention’d)
which lieth six Miles within the Land, North-West from the Harbor of <i>Cagway</i>.
Here the <i>English</i> have built a small Fort.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Passage</i>, a small Town, built also by the <i>English</i> six Miles from <i>St. Jago</i>, for
the convenience of going to <i>Cagway</i>, consisting of about fifty Houses and a Fort,
whence cross this Harbor, about three Leagues distant is the Town of 3. <i>Cagway</i>,
seated on the Extream end of the Point, containing in it above six hundred Houses,
all built by the <i>English</i>, besides the Governor’s Palace, and the Houses where the
Stores for the Army are kept.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is counted the most healthful Place in all the Island, and the very Scale of
Trade, where all Merchants, Strangers, and Sailors reside.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here, upon the utmost Angle of the Point towards the Sea, is a round Tower,
built of Lime and Stone; about which is rais’d a strong and regular Fort, containing
sixty pieces of Ordnance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Port Royal.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>This Town is now call’d <i>Port Royal</i>, and is thought to contain about sixteen
thousand Inhabitants.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Landward.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>A Mile from hence is another Fort, call’d <i>Landward</i>, which runs from the Harbor
to the Sea, to defend the Town from any Attempt by Land.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Little Island.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Off the Mouth of the Harbor towards the Sea, lie divers small Islands, the most
Western of which being within half a League of the Fort, and between which
and the Fort every Ship that comes into the Harbor is necessitated to pass: It is
call’d <i>Little Island</i>; where a Fort is likewise rais’d, to defend the Mouth of the Harbor,
containing eight pieces of Ordnance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another Fortification is at <i>Portmorant</i>, which we shall make mention of amongst
the Harbors.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chief Ports and Harbors.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>The chief Harbors of this Island, are 1. <i>Port Anthony</i>, on the North, a very safe
Land-lock’d Harbor, onely the coming in is somewhat difficult, the Channel being
narrow’d by a little Island that lies off the Mouth of the Port.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. On the East of the Island is <i>Portmorant</i>, a very capacious Harbor, where Ships
do conveniently Wood and Water, and Ride safe from all Winds.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. On the South is <i>Port Cagway</i>, a Harbor wonderfully convenient, secure and
capacious, being five Leagues over in some places, in others four, and at the narrowest,
three; it is Land-lock’d by a Point of Land that runs twelve Miles South-West
from the Main of the Island, having the great River that comes by <i>Los Angelos</i>,
and <i>St. Jago</i> running into it, and divers Springs about it, where Ships do conveniently
Wood and Water. Here is every where good Anchorage, the Road being so
deep, that a Ship of a thousand Tun may lay his sides to the Shore of the Point, and
load and unload with Planks afloat.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. On the West is <i>Point Megrill</i>, a Port very convenient and secure; to Windward
from which, a little North-West, is the Seat of the old Town of <i>Mellilla</i>,
founded by <i>Columbus</i>, as afore mention’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>The chief Plantations of this Island, are 1. <i>Portmorant</i>, above the Harbor before
mention’d, and by the two Rivers that run into it. Here are good Plantations
of Sugars, Cottons, Tobacco’s, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>2. Hence about ten Miles lieth <i>Morant</i>, where a thousand Acres of Land have
been taken up for my Lord <i>Willoughby</i>, and a Company of Merchants.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. Hence farther Leeward lieth <i>Yallow</i>, having good Plantations of Cotton, Tobacco,
and other Provisions, excellent <i>Savana</i>’s, and some store of tame Cattel.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. Thirty Miles hence, on the North side of <i>Cagway</i> is <i>Ligonce</i>, where are excellent
Plantations of Sugar, Cotton, and Tobacco, very pleasant <i>Savana</i>’s and some
store of wild Cattel.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. Twenty Miles farther West, nine Miles from the Harbor of <i>Cagway</i>, is <i>Los
Angelos</i>, having some Plantations of Sugar, <i>Cacao</i>, and Tobacco, all which were old
<i>Spanish</i> Plantations, and are less considerable than those made by the <i>English</i> in
other places.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. Eight Miles from hence, North-West, is <i>Guanaboa</i>, where likewise were some
<i>Spanish</i> Plantations, since improv’d by the <i>English</i>, who have very many excellent
Plantations of Sugar, <i>Cacao</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c010'>7. Hence West South-West lieth <i>Guatabacoa</i>, a most pleasant rich and fertile part
of the Countrey, abounding with Cattel, and excellent <i>Savana</i>’s. Here the <i>Negro</i>’s
setled that revolted from the <i>Spaniards</i>, who are endeavouring to make some Plantations
of Tobacco’s and Provisions, and with them are setled some few <i>English</i>,
who have divers Walks of <i>Cacao</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The several Governors of the <i>English</i> in <i>Jamaica</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The several Governors of this Island since the taking of it by the <i>English</i>, are as
followeth: General <i>Robert Venables</i> staid upon the Place about three Moneths after
the taking of it, and at his coming away for <i>England</i> he left the chief Command
to Major General <i>Richard Fortescue</i>, who liv’d Governor about three Moneths; after
which Lieutenant General <i>Edward Doyly</i> was by the Army elected President; but
upon his coming away soon after for <i>England</i>, Lieutenant General <i>William Brain</i> was
sent over Governor in his room; who living in the Government about three quarters
of a year, did as it were bequeathe it again to <i>Doyly</i>, for he was chosen by vertue
of a Blank Commission, wherein <i>Brain</i> had inserted his Name whom he would
have succeed, and remain’d Commander in Chief both by Land and Sea till His
Majesty’s Restauration, and then by His Majesty’s Letters Patents was confirm’d in
the Government, and so was the first that was Governor there for His Majesty:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>The next that succeeded was the Lord <i>Windsor</i>, upon whose coming away Sir <i>Thomas

<h3 id='c344' class='c001'>CHAP. XVII.<br /> The Islands call’d the Lucaies.</h3>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Description of the <i>Lucaies</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Having done with the four Islands of <i>Barlovento</i>, as they are term’d, <i>viz.</i> <i>Hispaniola</i>,
<i>Cuba</i>, <i>Porto Rico</i>, and <i>Jamaica</i>, we come next to the <i>Lucaies</i>, so call’d,
as some think, from <i>Lucaioneque</i>, one of the biggest of them; they lie over
against <i>Florida</i>, Westward from the <i>Bermudas</i>, South-West and North of <i>Hispaniola</i>,
and the rest of the <i>Barloventi</i>; and because they are but small ones, and lie so near
the Continent, Geographers sometimes describe them as a part, or appertaining to
the Continent. The chiefest of these Islands are <i>Lucaioneque</i> afore-mention’d, <i>Bahama</i>,
and <i>Guanahani</i>; <i>Lucaioneque</i> is accounted the biggest of them all, and lieth in twenty
seven Degrees between <i>Bahama</i> and <i>Guanahani</i>. <i>Bahama</i> lies nearest to the Coast of
<i>Florida</i>, and gives Name to the <i>Straights</i> so call’d, which run between the <i>Cape</i> of
<i>Florida</i> and it, with such a violent Course and Torrent, that although it be above
sixteen Miles broad, yet many times neither Wind nor Oars, can prevail against it;
that though the Winds be prosperous, Ships cannot enter it; and if it be cross, they
go with the Current; yet those <i>Straights</i> the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet must pass in their Return
from the <i>Havana</i> towards <i>Spain</i>. <i>Guanahani</i> was the first piece of <i>American</i> Ground
discover’d by <i>Christopher Columbus</i>, and therefore by him call’d <i>San Salvador</i>, or <i>St. Saviour</i>,
because that thereby he was deliver’d from the mutinous rage of the Seamen,
who threatned to throw him over-board, if they discover’d not Land in such
a time. There are besides a number of small Isles scatter’d up and down, which are
generally comprehended in the number of the <i>Lucaies</i>; one is <i>Little Island</i>, encompass’d
with a company of Shelves call’d the <i>Bimini</i>, so that it is hardly accessible:
there goes a Tradition, that it hath been inhabited by very beautiful Women, the
fame of whom drew many to attempt to Land there and take up their Habitation;
in which Attempt many were cast away: There is said to be a Fountain in the
midst of it, of such a Vertue, that whosoever drank of the Waters of it, had their
Youth renew’d. Also three Islands, or rather Rocks, call’d <i>Los Martyres</i>, lying to
the South-East of <i>Cape Florida</i>, and cover’d for the most part with a whitish Sand
and a few Bushes growing on them: they seem at a distance to bear a resemblance
of Men, impal’d, or bound to Stakes, as the Martyrs in the primitive Times usually
were, which occasion’d the <i>Spaniards</i> so to Name them; ’tis very dangerous to
come too near them, but to have sight of them is of great use to Men at Sea; for by
passing these Rocks, and leaving them on the South-East, they certainly know, that
they are now entred the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Bahama</i>, that is, that they have left the Ocean,
and are fall’n in amongst those many Islands, which do, as it were, Barracado and
Block up the Eastern Coasts of <i>America</i>, towards <i>Nombre de Dios</i> and <i>Terra Firma</i>, as
they call it, through which the Continent is sometimes dangerous, by reason of contrary
Winds; and always such, that it requires the skill and care of an experienc’d
Pilot to conduct the Ships well thither. The rest are <i>Abacoa</i>, twelve Leagues long;
<i>Yuma</i>, twenty Leagues in length, and eight in breadth, between twenty four and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>twenty five Degrees; <i>Yumeata</i>, fifteen Leagues in length, between twenty three and
twenty four Degrees; <i>Jamana</i>, seven Leagues every way; <i>Yabague</i>, ten Leagues likewise,
and lying between twenty two and twenty three Degrees; <i>Magaguana</i>, twenty
Leagues long, and ten broad; <i>Quagua</i>, ten Leagues every way, and lying between
twenty and one and twenty Degrees; <i>Caycos</i>, five Leagues in length, and in the
one and twentieth Degree; <i>Mackre</i>, in the twentieth Degree, encompass’d with
Shelves; <i>Abreo</i>, environ’d also with Shelves, and fifteen Leagues long; also <i>Guatao</i>,
<i>Cigateo</i>, <i>Guanima</i>, <i>Jabaka</i>, <i>Triangulo</i>, and several others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Lucaies</i> left desolate by the <i>Spaniards</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>On these Islands are no Inhabitants; those that did live there were a harmless
simple People, and therefore the easier taken and carried away by the <i>Spaniards</i> that
have made them so desolate: Many of them seem of a good Mold, and the Latitude
promiseth much fertility. The Air is certainly good and wholsom, and not
so extream hot as other Parts of that heighth. There is scarce any Beast on them,
save a Coney that hath a Tail like a Rat, but Pigeons and other Birds in great
numbers.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is the Gum <i>Benjoin</i>, of the best and worst sort; <i>Guaiacum</i>, <i>Sasaparilla</i>, and
<i>Sassafras</i>; and on some of them Red-wood and Ambergreece.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our <i>English</i> Sea-men are little acquainted with these Islands, though they Sail
round them yearly.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>English</i> landing upon them.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the time of the Rebellion one Captain <i>Sail</i> and others, obtain’d a Patent, making
thither on the Coast of an Island, which was call’d <i>Illutheria</i>; his Ship was
wrackt, but the People recover’d the Shore with a few Necessaries.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Coasts of most of them are dangerous, and bad to make, and that Ship that
shall be near or amongst them, must keep the Lead always going; but with a wary
Pilot, and care in giving the Islands a fair Birth, they are easily recover’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spaniards</i> know this Place well, and have a yearly Trade thither for the

<h3 id='c345' class='c001'>CHAP. XVIII.<br /> The Caribby Islands.</h3>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Names of the <i>Caribbee</i> Islands.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The <i>Caribbee Islands</i>, as they are generally call’d, are a Row or Ridge, as it
were, of lesser Islands, which extend themselves almost in fashion of a
Bowe, from the Coast of <i>Paria</i> as far as <i>St. John de Porto Rico</i>; they are
otherwise call’d <i>The-Caraibes</i>, sometimes <i>The Camercanes</i>, and by some <i>The Islands of
Cannibals</i>, or <i>Man-eaters</i>, (though this Appellation cannot in reality be more appropriated
to these Islands, than to many other, either Islands, or Parts of the Continent
of <i>America</i>;) lastly, whereas all the Islands between <i>Florida</i> and <i>New Spain</i>, and
<i>Southern America</i>, are by some comprehended all under the Name of <i>The Antilles</i>;
yet the <i>Caribbees</i> and the <i>Antilles</i> are most generally, and, we conceive, most properly
accounted the same; and they are so call’d, either as lying like a Bar before
the greater Islands, or <i>Quasi Ant-Isles</i>, i. e. <i>Opposites Isles</i>; they lie all under the <i>Torrid
Zone</i>, between the eleventh and nineteenth Degrees of Northern Latitude, and are
twenty eight in number; but before we come to treat of each of them in particular,
we shall take notice of the most observable of those things which are common
to them all in general.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Temperature of the Air.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>The Air of all these Islands is of a good temperature and healthy, and the Heat
not so excessive in them at any time of the year, as might be conjectur’d from their
Situation under the <i>Torrid Zone</i>, by reason of a gentle East Wind, which rising in the
Morning, continues most commonly till towards the Evening, allaying the scorching
heat of the Sun, and refreshing the Air; but the Nights are commonly very
cold; and it is observable, that by how much the hotter any Day hath been, so
much the colder the Night following happens to be; whereof this reason is given,
That the Vapors rais’d in the Day-time by the Sun, and falling down condens’d at
Night, do very much cool the Air; but it is never so cold as to Freeze.</p>

<p class='c010'>For half a year together Day and Night are equal in these Parts, and the rest of
the Year the Day fourteen hours long, and the Night ten.</p>

<p class='c010'>From <i>April</i> to <i>December</i> there commonly fall here great Rains, and all that Season
is accounted Winter, and the Drought and Heat of the other Moneths is taken for
Summer; but the Woods of these Parts looking ever green, make as it were continual
Summer.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nature of the Soil.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Soil is generally as fertile as in most places of <i>Europe</i>, and each Island furnish’d
with fair Rivers, Brooks, Lakes, Springs, Wells, and other Sources of fresh
Water, besides in many places Mineral Waters, which are us’d with good success
in the cure of several Diseases; also out of some Mountains store of Brimstone
is digg’d, and it is conjectur’d that there are not wanting Mines of Gold and Silver,
if they were well look’d after; and there hath been often found Crystal upon the
Sands by Rivers sides.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Vines growing naturally in the <i>Caribbees</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Vine, though wild, and naturally growing in the Woods, yet yields a very
large fair Grape; and those which are cultivated in their Gardens or Vineyards,
bear excellent Grapes twice a year, but very little Wine is made of them, in regard
they find it will keep but very few days.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Wheat not apt to grow there.</div>

<p class='c010'>Wheat in the <i>Caribbees</i> grows up no farther than the Blade, and the reason is
judg’d to be, because through the rankness of the Soil, and for want of Winter, this
Grain springs up fast, and hath not substance enough left in the Root to supply it
up to maturity; but no doubt but Barley, Rye, and those other Grains, to the ripening
of which more Heat is requir’d, would thrive there very well.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides Lemmon-Trees, Orange-Trees, Citrons, and Pomegranates, and other
Fruit-Trees growing in <i>Europe</i>, there are very many sorts of Trees, Herbs, Pulse,
and other Plants, of a different kind from those amongst us, and peculiar for the
most part to these Islands.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fruit-Trees.</div>

<p class='c010'>Of Fruit-Trees, the most observable are the <i>Goyavier</i>, somewhat resembling the
Laurel, onely having a softer Leaf, and of a brighter Green; its Fruit about the
bigness of a Pearmain, but full of little Kernels like a Pomegranate.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Papayer</i>, which is of two kinds, one generally growing in all the Islands, the
other proper to <i>Santa Crux</i>; the first hath a Leaf not much unlike that of the Fig-Tree,
and the other bears a Fruit about the bigness of a Melon, which by the <i>Portuguese</i>
is call’d <i>Mamao</i>, from its resemblance of a Womans Breast: the Tree is hollow
and spungy within, and grows up sometimes to the heighth of twenty Foot.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Monick</i>, call’d by the Islanders <i>Corsot</i>, from the Name of an Island from
whence the Seeds were first brought by the <i>Dutch</i>, and bearing a Fruit like a small
Cucumber not perfectly ripe.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Junipa</i>, or <i>Jenipa</i>, by the <i>Portuguese</i> call’d <i>Jenipapo</i>; and by the <i>Brasilians</i>, <i>Jenipaba</i>;
having Leaves like those of the Walnut-Tree, Flowers like the <i>Narcissus</i>,
and a Fruit like a bak’d Apple, which when it falls from the Tree makes a noise
like the Report of a Gun discharg’d, which is said to proceed from the bursting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>forth of the Seed out of the thin Skin enclosing it, and breaking with a violence;
the Juice of it Dyes of a Violet-colour, and the Swine and Birds that feed upon it,
are said to have their Flesh and Fat of the same colour.</p>

<p class='c010'>A sort of Vine commonly call’d <i>The Raisin-Tree</i> and by the <i>Caribbeeans</i>, <i>Ouliem</i>;
whose Fruit being like a large Violet-colour’d Grape, hath in stead of the several
small Grain-stones which are inclos’d in the Husks of common Grapes, one hard
Stone, like that of a Plumb.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Acajou</i>, bearing for Fruit a kind of Chesnut, in form of a Hares Kidney,
which serves for a Crest to a very fair Apple that by degrees grows under it, of
which the Islanders make a Drink, very much in esteem amongst them, being of an
excellent taste.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Icaco</i>, a kind of small Plumb-Tree, so much coveted, and held for a Delicacy
by some People that live near the Gulf of <i>Hondures</i>, that they are from thence
call’d <i>Icacos</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Monbain</i>, which Fruit being a kind of yellowish Plumb, is chiefly made use
of to mix in the Drinks of <i>Ouicon</i> and <i>Maby</i>, to make them taste the better.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Courbury</i> is by some reckon’d to be but a species of the <i>Monbain</i>, onely more
full of Leaves, and growing higher and bigger; but the Fruit of the <i>Courbury</i> is sufficiently
different from that of the <i>Monbain</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Indian</i> Fig-Tree, differing in Leaf from the common Fig-Tree, but whose
Fruit both in figure and taste is not much unlike the Fig growing in these Parts:
This Tree is commonly of such a vast Bulk, that the Branches of some of them have
been seen to afford shelter to two hundred Men.</p>

<p class='c010'>A kind of Service-Tree, differing from ours, by its exceeding heighth, fair
Leaves, and pleasant Fruit.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Prickly or Thorny Palm, so call’d from its being arm’d all over with
Prickles, both Trunk and Leaves; by incision into its Branches a sort of Wine is
made, and it is conjectur’d to be the same Tree which the <i>Brasilians</i> call <i>Ayry</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Franc</i>-Palm, an exceeding high and streight Tree, bearing on the top of
its Trunk a whitish marrowy substance, by the <i>French</i> call’d <i>Choude Palmiste</i>, or
<i>Palm-Cabbage</i>; for being boyl’d with the thin Leaves that incircle it, and well season’d,
it is reckon’d amongst the Delicacies of the <i>Caribbees</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Latanier</i>, another kind of <i>Palm</i>; and <i>Cocoa</i>, which is also reckon’d amongst the several
sorts of Palms; this last is a Fruit-Tree famous all over <i>America</i>, and hath
been at large describ’d elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are also many other Trees fit for Dying, Joyners Work, and Building,
(besides the <i>Acajou</i> before mention’d, of the single Trunks whereof are made those
long Shallops call’d <i>Pyrages</i>, which are able to carry fifty Men) as</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Acomas</i>, of the same bulk and heighth with the <i>Acajon</i>, and equally esteem’d
by Joyners and Carpenters, and of the Fruit whereof the Woodquists grow fat at a
certain time of the year.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Rose-wood, to be rank’d amongst the chiefest of those Trees that are made
use of by Work-men.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Indian</i> Wood, a very precious and useful Tree for several sorts of Materials,
and of a very fine scent.</p>

<p class='c010'>The  <i>Iron-Wood</i>, so call’d from its hardness, weight and solidity, above all that
have hitherto been spoken of, and beyond either Cypress or Cedar for incorruptibility.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Brasile-Wood</i>, so call’d as growing most plentifully in <i>Brasile</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Yellow-Wood</i>, denominated from its Colour, and much esteem’d for its usefulness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>in Dying green Ebony, easily taking the lustre of the true Ebony, and being very
useful for the making of Cabinets and other curious Pieces of Work; It also Dyes
of a very fair Grass-green.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Roncon</i>, by the <i>Brasilians</i> call’d <i>Urnex</i>, in the Husks, succeeding the Flowers
whereof, which grow in little Bushes at the end of the Branches, is enclos’d a most
rich Vermilion Dye, of a very soft and viscous Matter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here are also many other Trees, either useful in Medicine, or other ways advantageous,
as the <i>Cassia</i>-Tree, of the bigness and figure of a Peach-Tree; the long
Pipes or Cods whereof, containing the Medicinal Fruit, are well known amongst
us by the Name of <i>Cassia-Fistula</i>, and to be had at every Apothecaries.</p>

<p class='c010'>Medicinal Nuts, each Nut containing three or four Stones in so many Cells, every
one of which is inclos’d within a thin white Pellicle, pleasant enough to the taste,
and out of which is extracted an Oyl, us’d by the <i>Portuguese</i> in several both Culinarie
and Physical occasions.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Cinamon-Tree, so noted for its aromatick Bark; also <i>Sandal-Wood</i>, <i>Guaiacum</i>,
and <i>Sassafras</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cotton-Tree and Soap-Tree, whose Uses the very Names imply, and which
Trees have been touch’d upon elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c010'>The arch’d <i>Indian</i> Fig-Tree, the Bodies of which Trees have been antiently the
sculking Holes and Retreats of the Inhabitants from their Enemies; the Bark is
useful for Tanners.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Gourd</i>-Tree, of the bigness and heighth of a great Apple-Tree, and of which
are made most of the Houshold Vessels and Utensils, which are in common use at
present amongst the Inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Mahot</i>-Tree, of the Bark of which are made Laces and Points.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Manyoc</i>, or <i>Mandioque</i>, of whose Root the <i>Cassava</i> Bread is made, and which
growing in several places of <i>America</i>, hath been already taken notice of; as likewise
the <i>Banana</i>-Tree, and that call’d <i>The Apple-Tree of Paradice</i>, otherwise <i>Adam’s Fig-Tree</i>,
the Fruit being reported to be of a very delicious taste.</p>

<p class='c010'>Other Trees not known in <i>Europe</i>, are the <i>Maposu</i>, divers kinds of Thorny Wood,
the Milky Tree, being of a venomous quality, the <i>Mancenilier</i>, and that whose Root
beaten to Powder, and thrown into Rivers, intoxicates the Fish, with several
others of less note.</p>

<p class='c010'>Innumerable sorts of Shrubs might here in like manner be reckon’d up, but the
chiefest are, That remarkable Plant, anciently known by the Name of <i>Ricinus</i>, and
commended for its Vertues by <i>Galen</i> and <i>Dioscorides</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Coral-Wood, so call’d from its little Seeds, which being as red as any Coral, are
us’d for Bracelets.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Jasmin</i>, bearing a Flower of an admirable sweet scent.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Candle-Wood</i>, so call’d from its combustibleness, by reason of an aromatick
Gum which is within.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Herbs, Flowers, Roots, and Pulse which grow here, are some of them common
in all parts of <i>Europe</i>, as Cabbages, Onions, Chibols, Melons, all sorts of
Millets, Cucumbers, Citruls, Parsnips, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>Others, if not peculiar to this Island, yet growing chiefly there, and in some
few parts of <i>America</i> besides, as the <i>Raquettes</i>, so call’d from the resemblance its
Leaves have with a Racket, a thorny-spreading Bush, whose Fruit being of a Vermilion
colour, makes the Urine of those that eat of it as red as Blood. Some liken
this Plant to the <i>Tunas</i>, already describ’d, which yields that rich Scarlet Dye call’d
<i>Cochinele</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>The <i>Torch</i>, so call’d by the <i>European</i> Inhabitants; by the Native Islanders, <i>Akoulerou</i>;
a great Thistle, or thorny Bush, putting forth from the middle of it long
streight Stalks like Torches, and bearing Fruit like a great Fig, not unpleasing to
the taste.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Lienes</i>, creeping upon the Earth, and spreading up and down like Ropes,
and bearing brown Husks of a Foot long, wherein are enclos’d a Fruit call’d <i>Sea-Chestnuts</i>,
of which are made Boxes to keep Snush, Tobacco, or the like.</p>

<p class='c010'>A sort of <i>Sempervivum</i>, which runs twisting upon Rocks, Trunks of old Trees,
like Misseltoe, and sometimes on the Ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>A sort of sensitive Plant, call’d by the Inhabitants <i>Haestiel</i>, or <i>The Living Herb</i>;
of which kind of Plant something hath been already touch’d upon, and which being
transplanted, is kept in several Gardens of the <i>Curiosi</i> as a Rarity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Sweet-Rush</i>, whose small Root dry’d, and reduc’d to Powder, helps Women
in Travail.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Balisier</i>, whose Leaf apply’d, mollifies and cools inflammations of Wounds.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Dart-Herb</i>, whose Root bruis’d and apply’d, draws away the Venom of
empoyson’d Darts; besides <i>Scolopendria</i>, a sort of Aloes, several kinds of Maidenhair,
and other medicinal Herbs.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Granadilla</i>, or <i>Passion-Flower</i>, growing in several other parts of <i>America</i>, and
describ’d elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is also a sort of Pease in some of these Islands, differing from ours, and
call’d <i>The Pease of Angola</i>, as first brought from thence. Likewise a sort of Beans
call’d <i>The Seven-years Beans</i>, by reason the same Stalk bears seven years one after
another.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Herb call’d <i>The Musk-Herb</i>, from the dusky colour of its Flower, and the
sweet scent of the Seed, grows also in these Parts very frequent.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Pyman</i>, or <i>American Pepper</i>, is the same with that before describ’d under the
Name of <i>Axi</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their <i>Potatoe</i> is a Root not unlike the <i>Topinambous</i>, or <i>Jerusalem-Artichokes</i>, otherwise
call’d <i>Saligots</i>, growing plentifully in our Gardens, but more wholsome, and
of a better taste.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Anana</i>’s, or <i>Pine-Apple</i>, accounted a most delicious Fruit, of an admirable
sweet scent, and very pleasant to behold, grow not onely plentifully in these
Islands, but in most places of <i>America</i>; besides the Sugar-Canes here, and in many
other places, but not so generally.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Plant from which is got the Dying Material call’d <i>Indico</i>, is very different
from that which grows in <i>Madagascar</i>, which bears small odoriferous Flowers, of a
white and purple Colour mix’d together.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of these Trees, Herbs, and other Plants, which are produc’d in these <i>Caribbee
Islands</i>, some are more peculiarly of the Growth of one Island, some of another; so
that we shall have occasion to speak more largely of some of them, when we come
to speak of each Island in particular.</p>

<p class='c010'>The four-footed Beasts found in these Islands, are chiefly the <i>Opassum</i>, the <i>Javaris</i>,
the <i>Tatan</i>, the <i>Agouty</i>, and the <i>Musk-Rat</i>, which being all of them no less known in
other Parts of the <i>New World</i>, have been already taken notice of, and of which we
may have also occasion to treat more at large in the particular Islands, we shall
therefore onely name the other Animals, whether Birds, Reptiles, Insects, or Fishes,
as partly having been heretofore treated of, and partly to be describ’d hereafter.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Birds are, the <i>Fregates</i>, <i>Fauves</i>, <i>Craw-fowl</i>, or <i>Grandgawsiers</i>, <i>Flammans</i>, <i>Swallows
of America</i>, <i>Arras</i>, <i>Canides</i>, <i>Parrots</i>, <i>Parroquito</i>’s, <i>Tremblo</i>’s, <i>Sparrows of America</i>, <i>Eagles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>of Orinoca</i>, <i>Manstenys</i>, <i>Colibrys</i>, besides what are common amongst us, as <i>Herons</i>, <i>Coots</i>,
or <i>Moor-hens</i>, <i>Black-birds</i>, <i>Feldivars</i>, <i>Thrushes</i>, <i>Turtles</i>, <i>Woodquists</i>, <i>Pintado</i>’s, &amp;c.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Reptiles.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Reptiles are, <i>Anotis</i>, <i>Zoquets</i>, and <i>Maboujats</i> (of which farther mention will
occur in the Isle of <i>St. Christopher) Globe-mouches</i>, nam’d by the <i>Caribbeeans</i>, Oulleouma,
<i>Scorpions</i>, and several sorts of <i>Lizards</i>, call’d by the <i>Caribbeeans</i>, Ouamayaca; by the
<i>Brasilians</i>, Senembi; and by other <i>Indians</i>, Jaquanas.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Insects.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Insects are, besides these common with us, as <i>Glow-worms</i>, <i>Palmer-worms</i>, <i>Spiders</i>,
<i>Bees</i>, &amp;c. the <i>Cucuyos</i>, mention’d in <i>Hispaniola</i>, and the <i>Flying Tyger</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fishes.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Fishes are, <i>Sea-Parrots</i>, the <i>Dorada</i>, by some call’d <i>The Sea-Bream</i>, by others,
<i>The Amber-fish</i>; the <i>Bonite</i>, the <i>Needle-fish</i>, the <i>Epadon</i>, or <i>Sword-fish</i>, the <i>Marsovin</i>, the
<i>Requiem</i>, the <i>Remora</i>, the <i>Lamantin</i>, the <i>Becune</i>, the <i>Sea-Urchin</i>, the <i>Sea-Woodcock</i>, besides
<i>Whales</i>, and a certan Fish call’d, for its hideous shape, <i>The Sea-Devil</i>, and lastly,
the <i>Sea-Unicorn</i>, with a particular Description of which we shall conclude, as having
it from Monsieur <i>du Montel</i>, who was an Eye-witness thereof.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the Sea-Unicorn.</div>

<p class='c010'>“This <i>Unicorn</i> (saith he) was pursuing a <i>Carangue</i>, or some other lesser Fish, with
such earnestness and impetuosity, that not considering that it needed a greater
depth of Water than the other, it stuck with half the Body dry on a Sand-bank,
whence it could not recover the deeper Waters ere it was destroy’d by the Inhabitants:
It was about eighteen Foot in length, being at the largest part of its
Body about the bigness of a Barrel: It had six great Fins like the ends of Galley-Oars,
whereof two were plac’d near the Gills, and the other four on the sides of
the Belly at equal distances; they were of a Vermilion red colour: All the upper
part of the Body was cover’d with great Scales, about the bigness of a
Crown-Piece, which were of a blue colour, intermix’d with several Spangles of
Silver; near the Neck the Scales were closer, and of a dark colour, seeming as
it were a Collar; the Scales under the Belly were yellow, the Tail forked, the
Head somewhat bigger than that of a Horse, and near the same figure: It was
cover’d with a hard and dark-colour’d Skin; and as the Land-<i>Unicorn</i> hath one
Horn in his Fore-head, so this Sea-<i>Unicorn</i> had a very fair one issuing out of the
fore-part of his Head, about nine Foot and a half in length; it was as streight
as could be, and from the place whence it came out it grew smaller and smaller
to the very Point, which was so sharp, that being thrust hard, it would enter into
Wood or Stone, or some more solid Substance; it was at the place where it
came out of the Head, about sixteen Inches about, and from thence to two thirds
of the length it was like a Screw, or, to say better, made waving like a wreath’d
Pillar, save that the Channels grew smaller and smaller, till they gently ended in
a Point, which was two Inches beyond the fourth Foot: All the lower part had
over it an Ash-colour’d Skin, which was all over cover’d with a small soft Hair,
short as Plush, and of the colour of a wither’d Leaf, but under that it was as
white as Ivory: As to the other part, which seem’d naked, it was naturally polish’d,
of a shining Black, mark’d with certain small white and yellow Strokes,
and of such solidity, that a sharp File could hardly get a little small Powder from
it: It had no Ears standing up, but two spacious Gills, as the other Fishes; the
Eyes were about the bigness of a Hens Egg; the Ball, which was of a Skye-colour
Enamell’d with Yellow, was encompass’d with a certain Vermilion, which had
beyond it another as clear as Crystal: The Mouth was wide enough, and furnish’d
with several Teeth, whereof those before were extreamly sharp, and those
towards the Throat in both Jaws were broad, and a little knobbed: The
Tongue was of a length and thickness proportionable, and cover’d with a rough
Skin of a Vermilion colour. What was further remarkable, is, that this Fish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>had upon the Head a kind of Crown, rising above the Skin about two Inches,
and made oval-wise, the Extremities whereof ended in a Point. Above three
hundred Persons of that Island did eat of the Meat of it, and that plentifully, and
thought it extreamly delicate; It was interlarded with Fat, and being boyl’d it
came up in flakes like fresh Cod, but it had a much more excellent taste.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Those who had seen this rare Fish alive, and had with great Levers broken
the Back of it, affirm’d, That he had made prodigious Attempts to thrust them
with his Horn, which he turn’d with an inexpressible dexterity and nimbleness,
and that if he had had as much Water under him as would have born him up, he
would have been too hard for them all. When the Entrails were taken out, it
was found that he liv’d by Prey; for there were within him the Scales of several
kinds of Fish.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What could be preserv’d of this miraculous Animal, especially the Head, and
the precious Horn fastned in it, hung up near two years at the Guard-house of
the Island, till Monsieur <i>Le Vasseur</i>, the Governor of it, presented one Monsieur
<i>Des Trancarts</i> (a Gentleman of <i>Xaintonge</i>, who had given him a Visit) with the
Horn. Not long after, coming over in the same Ship with the Gentleman, who
had that precious Rarity put up in a long Chest, our Ship was cast away near
the Island of <i>Payala</i>, one of the <i>Assores</i>, and all the Goods were lost, but nothing
so much regretted as the loss of that Chest.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Natives how call’d.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Natives call themselves <i>Cubao-bonon</i>, that is, <i>Inhabitants of the Islands</i>, and <i>Caribbeeans</i>;
which last Denomination was not onely receiv’d amongst the <i>American</i>
Isles, but also on the Main Continent of the <i>Northern</i> and <i>Southern America</i>, long
before the <i>Spaniards</i> coming thither.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Original.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Cofachites</i> come to Terms of Agreement with the <i>Apalachites</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Concerning the original of these People, there are several Opinions; for those
who make them to be Extracted from the <i>Jews</i>, have no other testimony, but that
they abstain from Swines-flesh: Those that take them for a People fled from the
great Islands, <i>Hispaniola</i>, <i>Jamaica</i>, <i>Cuba</i>, and <i>Porto Rico</i>, to save themselves from the
<i>Spaniards</i> Cruelty, dispute against a known Truth; for who knows not, that the <i>Indians</i>
who escap’d the <i>Spanish</i> Slaughter, have not the least resemblance either in
Language or Customs with the Cannibals? nay more, they are mortal Enemies to
them; besides that, the Cannibals at that time when <i>Columbus</i> first arriv’d, possess’d
those Places which they now inhabit. The Cannibals seem ignorant themselves
in this Point: for they affirm their Extraction to be from <i>Guyana</i>, where the <i>Calibites</i>
speak the same Language, and also observe the same Customs and Religion:
The occasion of their removal they ascribe to the King of the <i>Arovages</i>, who made
all the adjacent People about his Court, Slaves to him; which to prevent, they first
went to <i>Tabago</i>, where being strengthned by new Comers, they resolv’d to take
revenge on him; and Engaging with him in a Field-Battel, utterly defeated him,
and spar’d none of his Party alive, except the Women; whence it proceeds, that
the <i>Arovage</i> Women have the same Customs and Language with the <i>Caribbeans</i>. But
<i>Bristock</i>, an <i>English</i> Knight, by long Conversation experienc’d in the several <i>American</i>
Tongues, saith, That the <i>Caribbeeans</i> have their Original from the <i>Apalachites</i> in
<i>Florida</i>, who being a valiant People, destroy’d many of the Natives that inhabited
<i>Mexico</i>, that so they might Settle themselves there; to which purpose they built a
City like that of <i>Apalache</i>. The <i>Cofachites</i> inhabiting Northerly, and spread over a
barren and Rocky Countrey, made use of this opportunity to conquer their deserted
Habitation: for on a set-time they set fire to all the Villages, and spoyl’d all things
which they could not carry away with them, that not the least hopes of returning
might be left them; therefore they must either Conquer or Die: which resolv’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>upon, they fell unawares on the <i>Apalachites</i>, whose King had nevertheless so
much time, that he Guarded the usual Paths which directed to the inhabited Villages:
But the <i>Apalachites</i> leaving the common Roads, climb’d over almost inaccessible
Mountains, and so got into the heart of the Countrey, which exceedingly
amaz’d <i>Paracousis</i> (for so that King was call’d) who lay Encamp’d at the Foot of a
Mountain, whether the Van of the <i>Apalachites</i> were marching: whereupon he sending
his Army to meet them, they began a most fierce Combat; when at last both
Parties wanting Arrows, they fell upon one another with Clubs till the Night
parted them; and neither could boast of the Victory. At last this War was turn’d
into Peace, and the Articles of Agreement were these, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c010'><i>That the</i> Cofachites <i>should for ever possess the Province</i> Amana, <i>and become one People
with the</i> Apalachites, <i>and acknowledge the King of</i> Apalache <i>for their Chief Governor</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>They fall off.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Are brought to worship the Sun.</div>

<p class='c010'>After which the <i>Cofachites</i> were call’d <i>Caribbeeans</i>, which signifies <i>Accidental Subjects</i>:
But these two sorts of People did not long agree; for the <i>Caribbeeans</i> sleighted
the Customs of the  <i>Apalachites</i> in the Countrey <i>Bemarin</i>, and at the same time
threw off their Obedience to the King, chose one <i>Ragazin</i> for their Governor, subdu’d
the neighboring Province <i>Matika</i>, and at last defi’d the <i>Apalachites</i>; who inferior
to them in Strength, and making use of subtilty, suppos’d it the best way to
make a Difference amongst the <i>Caribbeeans</i> themselves; to which the Priests freely
proffer’d their Assistance, and their Design prov’d also successful; for the <i>Caribbeeans</i>
regarding no Religion (onely dreading the angry Deity <i>Mabouya</i>) the <i>Apalachite</i>
Priests call’d <i>Jaova</i>’s, took great pains to perswade their Neighbors to the worshipping
of the Sun; which so prevail’d, that a considerable number of them ascending
the Mountain <i>Olaimi</i>, fell down and shew’d Reverence to that celestial Luminary;
which Opportunity <i>Paracousis</i> taking notice of, caus’d the <i>Jaova</i>’s to publish amongst
the <i>Caribbeeans</i>, That in the beginning of the <i>Maairims</i>, or <i>March</i>, a great Feast should
be held in Reverence to the Sun on the usual place, where the King would Entertain,
and give Presents to all the Worshippers thereof.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Sun generally worshipp’d by the antient <i>Heathens</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>How great a Religion this Sun-worship was antiently amongst the <i>Gentiles</i>, appears
from the Writings of several authentick Authors.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Syrians</i>, whose Idolatry the <i>Israelites</i> learn’d, honor the Sun by the Name of
<i>Babal</i>, which signifies <i>Lord</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Phenicians</i> call’d the Sun <i>Beel-samen, Lord of the Heavens</i>; and the Citizens of
<i>Accaron</i>, <i>Baal-zebahim</i>, <i>Lord of the Offerings</i>; but God chang’d the Name to <i>Baal-zebub</i>,
or <i>The God of Flyes</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Moloch</i>, or <i>Milcom</i> also signifi’d the Sun amongst the <i>Ammonites</i>; in honor of which
Children were carried by their Parents, and set between two great Fires, or else by
the Priests, upon pretence of cleansing them; and sometimes parch’d to death in
an Image of <i>Moloch</i>, which had seven Cavities heated like Ovens.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Macrobius</i> tells us, That the <i>Assyrians</i> ascrib’d the supream Command to the Sun,
under the Name of <i>Adad</i>, and to the Goddess <i>Adargatis</i>, representing the Image of
<i>Adad</i> with Beams darting downwards, and <i>Adargatis</i> with those that shot upwards:
by the first they express’d, that the celestial Power consisted in Sun-beams, which
shooting downwards warm the Earth; and by the second, that all things by those
Beams were cherish’d and enliven’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most magnificent Temple which <i>Syria Apamena</i> boasted, was Consecrated to
the Sun.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Arabians</i> Offer’d Myrrhe on the tops of their Houses at the Rising of the
Sun; who also was the <i>Chamos</i> and <i>Baal-Peor</i> of the <i>Moabites</i> and <i>Medians</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Near the <i>Red-Sea</i>, lay the City <i>Baisamsa</i>, which signifies <i>The House of the Sun</i>, famous
for the many Feasts which were kept there in honor of this Planet.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>The <i>Persians</i> accounted this Luminary for the greatest God, and Consecrated to
him three several Feasts, looking upon him as the Author of Wisdom, Goodness,
and Power, and is express’d by three several Operations, <i>viz.</i> Warmth, Light, and
Distinction of Time.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Egyptians</i> honor’d the Name of <i>Osiris</i>, whom some will have to be the same
with <i>Misraim</i>, or <i>Chamszoon</i>, the first Founder of the <i>Egyptian</i> Monarchy.</p>

<p class='c010'>In <i>Egypt</i> also was famous amongst many other Cities that of <i>Heliopolis</i>, which
signifi’d <i>The City of the Sun</i>; where the Ox <i>Mnevis</i> or <i>Menapis</i> being Consecrated to
the Sun, was religiously worshipp’d. This Image is describ’d by <i>Macrobius</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Moors</i> made likewise great Offerings to their <i>Assabin</i>, for so they call’d the
Sun; and allow’d their Priests onely the priviledge to gather Cinamon, and that
with this <i>Proviso</i>, That they should first Offer forty four Oxen, besides Goats and
Rams, to <i>Assabin</i>, nor should fetch the least Stick of Cinamon either immediately
before or after Sun-set: The Cinamon brought altogether, was to be divided by
the Chief Priest, and the rest having each their Portion assign’d, that which remain’d
was sold to the Merchants, to Trade with into Foreign Parts; but if the
Sun chanc’d to set the Cinamon on fire, then they concluded they had not dealt
justly.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Greeks</i>, according to <i>Proclus</i>, hung a long Pole full of Laurel and Flowers
on every seventh day of the Moneth; on the top thereof was a great Copper Ball,
from which hung others still lesser and lesser; about the middle of the Pole hung
three hundred and sixty five Garlands; and the bottom thereof was cover’d with a
Womans Garment of a yellow colour: The uppermost Ball represented the Sun,
the lesser the Stars, and the Garlands the Days of the Year; in which manner they
worshipp’d the Sun.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Why Divine Worship so generally given to the Sun.</div>

<p class='c010'>The same Luminary the <i>Massagetes</i> and old <i>Germans</i> ador’d in antient times; and to
this day the People in the utmost North, <i>Japanners</i>, <i>Chineses</i>, <i>Tartars</i>, and the <i>East</i> and
<i>West-Indians</i>, pay their chief Devotions to the Sun; the reason of which may easily
be made out: for it is the common Opinion of all Men, as <i>Aristotle</i>, <i>Simplicius</i>, <i>Themistius</i>,
and other Heathens witness, to place the Omnipotent Godhead in the uppermost
Orb, which surrounds the Earth; wherefore those that Pray, lift up their
Hands to Heaven: but because the rest of the Heavens appear not so resplendent as
the Sun, therefore they take the Sun for the onely chief God, whether for its exceeding
lustre and glory, or for its being a hundred and sixty times bigger than the
Earth; or for its swift Course, in running ten hundred thousand Leagues in so
short a time, or for its nourishing and genial Warmth, which gives Life to all
things, or for its necessary Light, by which all worldly Affairs are manag’d, or for
its measuring the Days by its moving from East to West, and the Seasons of the
Year, by a Course from the South to the North; for all these excellent qualities
being well consider’d by the most Learned <i>Heathens</i>, or observ’d by those of lesser
Judgment, have made them shew that Honor to a visible Creature, which is onely
due to the invisible Creator.</p>

<p class='c010'>These and such like Arguments induc’d the <i>Caribbeeans</i> to go to <i>Bemarin</i>, where
the Feast of the Sun was to be kept.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Apalachites</i> and <i>Caribbeans</i> make an Offering to the Sun on the Mountain <i>Olaimi</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Part of the <i>Caribbeans</i> revolt from the <i>Apalachites</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>They people the <i>Caribees</i> and grow powerful.</div>

<p class='c010'>The  <i>Apalachite</i> King also Entertain’d the neighboring People exceeding courteously
in the chief City <i>Melilot</i>; from whence he was carried in a Chair on the Shoulders
of four Men, with sound of Pipes and Drums, and an innumerable company
of People, to the top of the Mountain <i>Olaimi</i>, where he made a stately Offering to
the Sun, and afterwards Feasting and Caressing the <i>Caribbeeans</i> with Gifts, he sent
them home all well contented and satisfi’d with their Entertainment. This Custom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>was yearly observ’d, when at last they began to neglect their Duty, wherefore
<i>Toltlabin</i> resolv’d to proclaim War against the <i>Caribbeeans</i>, if they did not continue
paying their Devotions to the Sun: which Injunction was differently receiv’d;
some judg’d it to be inconsistent with their purchas’d Freedom, to receive Laws for
Religion from a neighboring King, alledging, That if any Reverence was due to
the Sun, it might as well be given on the Mountains of <i>Amana</i> as within <i>Toltlabin</i>’s
Realm: others, who lov’d Peace, and had a zeal to the <i>Olaimi</i> Religion, would not
be against the Proposals, which occasion’d a Contention amongst themselves, and
every one apply’d himself to those that were of his Opinion; nevertheless those that
stood upon their Freedom, were of the greatest Party; wherefore the Worshippers
of the Sun clos’d with the <i>Apalachites</i>, who going out with their Forces, routed the
other Party, and receiv’d those <i>Caribbeeans</i> that joyn’d with them in Religion into
Co-partnership also in the Government, so that they united into one People: But
those that were routed rally’d again, and not without thousands of Inconveniences
made towards the Sea, where Embarquing, they Landed first on the Isle <i>Ajay</i>, now
call’d <i>Sancta Crux</i>, and in process of time grew very populous; for from thence by
degrees have been peopled all the little Isles which lie before <i>America</i>, and grew so
considerable, that they were sought to by the <i>Calabites</i>, to side with them against
the <i>Arovaces</i>, <i>Yaos</i>, <i>Sappayos</i>, and other People their Enemies on the Main Continent,
where they have taken many large Countreys, extending as far as <i>Brasile</i>,
where they are greatly respected and fear’d for their Valor and Policy in warlike
Affairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>But because the memory of antique Passages hath no firm foundation in Books,
having been onely taken by Tradition from time to time amongst the <i>Caribbeeans</i>,
therefore we cannot give you an exact Account of their Removal from <i>Florida</i>; yet
it remains without contradiction, that it hapned above five Ages before the <i>Spaniards</i>
Arrival, which time at least was requir’d to the peopling of so many great Islands
and Kingdoms.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Original of the <i>Apalachites</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Concerning the Original of the <i>Apalachites</i>, they themselves affirm, that they
cannot certainly determine the time when they first Setled here: however, they
report that they have peopled the Provinces <i>Bemarin</i>, <i>Amana</i>, and <i>Matika</i>, many Ages
ago. That they are Extracted from the <i>Tartars</i>, appears not obscurely, by their
Customs, Idolatry, and Language. Amongst other things, they have learn’d from
the <i>Tartars</i> religiously to remember those Kings which perform’d any grand Exploits
in the Service of their Countrey. Amongst others, the <i>Apalachites</i> make mention
in their <i>Areitos</i>, or Songs, of a King call’d <i>Maydo</i>, eminent for his noble Atchievements,
and prudent Governing of his People.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their opinions in Religion.</div>

<p class='c010'>They believe that the Sun many Ages since was Darken’d or Ecclips’d twenty
four Hours together, during which time the Waters over-flow’d the highest Mountains,
except that of <i>Olaimi</i>, where there stood a stately Temple, built in honor of
the Sun; in which all those that fled thither were preserv’d, and dispers’d afterwards
into several parts to re-people the World as soon as the Waters were abated,
and the Sun appear’d in his full lustre again: whereupon they imagine, that to this
day their Bird <i>Tonatzuli</i>, at the Rising of the Sun congratulates his appearance
with great joy, and at his Setting, requests his speedy return from under the
Horizon.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Bird <i>Tonatzuli</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Tonatzuli</i> is a Bird like a Bull-Finch, onely its Belly and Wings are of a
Golden colour, the Back and Tail blue, its Head adorn’d with divers colour’d Feathers,
its Claws and Bill like Ivory, and it Sings like a Nightingale.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the Mountain <i>Olaimi</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>As for <i>Olaimi</i>, it is a perfect round Mountain; the Way which leads to the top
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>thereof runs winding two Leagues long, and is planted on each side with Cedar,
Pine-Trees, <i>Cassine</i>, and <i>Sassafrass</i>, the top of which is a fair Plain a League in circumference;
Eastward from it is a Cavern, to which Nature hath afforded more Convenience
and Ornament than could be given to the same by Art and Charges: The
first Beams of the Rising Sun dart into the Cavern, which being oval, appears like
a white Vault, which on the top hath a great Hole for the Air to go in at: The
bottom is like the purest Marble; on the Floor stands a Stone Cistern to receive
the Moisture which drops out of the Rocks. Whilest the People Danc’d on the
fore-mention’d Plain, Feasted and Sung, the Priests Offer’d Myrrhe, and all manner
of Perfumes.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Clothes which the Rich gave to the Sun, were distributed amongst the
Poor, according to a List which was taken of them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The occasion of the <i>Apalachites</i> embracing <i>Christianity</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>But in process of time the <i>Apalachites</i> have most of them embrac’d the <i>Christian</i>
Religion; the first occasion thereof was this: When <i>John Ribauld</i> had brought a
<i>French</i> Colony to <i>Florida</i>, and gain’d a Fort, (which from King <i>Charles</i> the Ninth he
nam’d <i>Charles-Fort</i>) the <i>Spanish</i> Commander <i>Peter Melendez</i> fell unawares upon him,
and so far impower’d his Men, who had of themselves a natural hatred against the
<i>French</i>, that they spar’d neither Man, Woman, nor Child; onely ten Men escaping
the bloody Banquet, fled to the <i>Floridan</i> King <i>Zaturiona</i>, where they were kindly receiv’d,
and hearing of the Civility and Power of the King of <i>Apalache</i> desir’d that
they might go thither; which <i>Zaturiona</i> not onely granted, but also furnish’d the
seven <i>French</i>-men (for the other three were dead) with good Guides, who visited
<i>Zaturiona</i>’s Relations, living in several Villages along the pleasant Stream <i>Selay</i>,
over which they pass’d on large Boughs artificially joyn’d together, and travell’d
through Woods, Marshes, and Mountains full of ravenous Beasts, and sometimes
Engag’d with the stragling <i>Floridans</i> which lurk’d in the most desolate Wildernesses:
having travell’d two days Journey, by an Ambuscade of King <i>Timago</i>’s
People, they lost two of their Guides, the rest being dangerously wounded, and
through many Difficulties came at last to <i>Avoeka</i>, and from thence to the King of
<i>Apalache</i>’s Court, who receiv’d them all with great kindness: Whereupon they resolv’d,
being induc’d thereto by their courteous Reception, fruitfulness of the Soil,
and good Customs of the Inhabitants, to Settle themselves, all but two of them,
who return’d with the Guides to <i>Zaturiona</i>: the rest that stay’d there, endeavor’d
by promulgating the <i>Christian</i> Religion, to reduce the <i>Pagans</i> to the belief thereof;
which many embrac’d, and also learn’d the <i>French</i> Tongue, notwithstanding their
Priests <i>Jaova</i>’s oppos’d the same. After the death of the <i>French</i> (which the <i>Apalachites</i>
much bemoan’d) their Idolatry had like to have gotten the upper hand again, had
not some <i>English</i> Families, fleeing from <i>Virginia</i> from the Cruelties of the <i>Indians</i>,
and not able to reach <i>New England</i>, Landed at <i>Florida</i>, with intention at first onely
to get fresh Provisions, but Rowing up the River <i>Selay</i>, and taken with the pleasantness,
they chose the Province <i>Bemarin</i> for their Habitation, where accordingly
they Setled <i>Anno 1621.</i> Amongst them were several Learned Men, which so effectually
perswaded the <i>Heathens</i> to embrace the <i>Christian</i> Faith, that in twenty eight
years time the King and most of his Nobles were Converted and Baptiz’d by them
in the chief City <i>Melilot</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>But since our Design is onely to give you an exact Account of those People
which inhabit the Islands lying before <i>America</i>, it is sufficient that we have shew’d
you how they are Extracted from the <i>Cosachites</i> and the <i>Apalachites</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>As to the Customs of the <i>Caribbeeans</i>, since they are very much alter’d by their
long Conversation with the <i>Europeans</i>, we cannot better inform our selves of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>antient Customs, than from those which to this day are observ’d on <i>St. Vincent</i>, and
some parts of the Main Continent, where the <i>Caribbeeans</i> have learn’d nothing from
any Strangers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the <i>Caribbeeans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Caribbeeans</i> are a well proportion’d People with broad Shoulders and Hips,
round Faces, without Beards, wide Mouthes, white Teeth, little Eyes like the <i>Tartars</i>,
Feet so hard, that they are almost Dart-proof, flat Noses, so made by squeezing
them down in their Infancy, and long black Hair. There are few or no deformed
People amongst them; all of them go stark naked, and paint their Bodies Red
with a Plant call’d <i>Rocou</i>, and Oyl; about their Eyes they draw a black Circle
with the Juice of the Apple <i>Junipa</i>. This their Painting serves them both as an
Ornament, and to make them strong. Others anoint their Bodies all over with a
glewy Stuff, on which they stick all sorts of Feathers. Others use Gum and Flowers.
Moreover, they adorn their Head with Plumes, their Ears with Fish-bones, or
Scales of the <i>Caret</i>, or pieces of Crystal, which they also hang in their Lips and
Noses. The Men wear Armlets near their Shoulders, and the Women about their
Wrists; about their Legs they tie for Garters Strings of Seeds: others take a pride
in wearing the Bones of their slain Enemies, and the Teeth of the <i>Agouty</i>, Tygers,
wild Cats, or Cockle shells. When they appear in greatest lustre, then they
wear Armlets under their Arm-pits, and also Scarfs of Feathers, which either hang
over their Shoulders, or are girt about their Middle, so that one end thereof touches
their Thighs. They set an exceeding value on certain pieces of Copper call’d
<i>Caracolis</i>, the least of which they hang in their Ears, and the biggest before their
Breasts: and because they are fetch’d out of the Province of the <i>Arovages</i> their Enemies,
they are esteem’d as Marks of true Valor, and he is highly esteem’d that
wears them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Language.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Caribbeeans</i> which Converse with the <i>Europeans</i>, speak two sorts of Languages,
the oldest of which is smooth, acceptable, fluent, and for the most part spoke
between the Lips. According to the several pronunciations one word hath divers
significations: but the Mystery of their oldest Language they will discover to
none. It is very observable, that the <i>Caribbeean</i> Men speak several words, which
though the Women understand, yet are never spoken by them: and also the antient
People use several Sayings which the younger never mention, and the Youths such
likewise as are never spoken by the Antient, which being spoken apart by each in
the time of War, are understood by none but their Soldiers, that so their Designs
may the better be kept secret. But their mix’d Language hath many of the <i>European</i>
words, especially of the <i>Spanish</i>, which they speak whensoe’re they converse
with the <i>Europeans</i>. Moreover, though the <i>Caribbeeans</i> on the least occasion laugh
aloud, yet they are of a dull Spirit, stubborn, and nothing to be got out of them
but by fair means.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Manners.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Employment is Hunting, Fishing, Tilling, Building of Houses, and the
like. Theft is not known amongst them, so that no Man is suspicious of his Neighbor;
wherefore they leave their Huts open both Night and Day. They are also
seldom at Variance one with another, but generally Love sways amongst them; yet
if a Quarrel doth happen, then the injur’d Person revenges himself to the heighth.
Persons that profess Chastity are much honor’d amongst them; and here Youth
bears great respect to Age.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Ignorance.</div>

<p class='c010'>They are also very ignorant in natural Knowledge, insomuch that when the
Moon is Eclips’d, they suppose that it is devour’d by <i>Maboya</i>; and wheresoe’re
they smell any ill scent, they believe the Devil to be not far from thence. Gunpowder
they suppose to be a Grain, and are very fearful of Fire-Arms: Though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>they have many brave Salt-pits, yet they use no Salt, nor eat any Swines-flesh,
though all those Islands abound in that sort of Animal, fearing that if they should
eat the same, it would cause them to have little Eyes, which they account very
homely, though it is a property generally incident to them; neither will they eat
any Tortoise, because they would not be so gross as that Creature. Lastly, they
know now no greater Number than they reckon on their Fingers and Toes, for
what exceeds twenty is to them innumerable: They hold that good Spirits, whom
they call <i>Akamoue</i>, residing in Heaven, never trouble themselves with Earthly
Affairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Offerings consist in <i>Cassave</i> and the first of their Fruits, which are set at the
end of their Huts in Vessels on small Tables, cover’d with Leaves or Rushes,
without uttering any Prayers; for they never Pray but in publick in company of
the <i>Boyez</i> or Priests, and that either for revenge against Injuries, or for recovery
from Sickness, or that they may know the Events of War, or for Protection against
the <i>Maboya</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Each <i>Boye</i> hath his peculiar God, which, Singing with a conjuring Verse, he calls
to him in the Night whilst he Smoaks a Pipe of Tobacco.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Fear of the <i>Maboya</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Some have been of Opinion, that this Conceit of the <i>Maboya</i> proceeds from the
phlegmatick Nature of the <i>Caribbeeans</i>, who in their melancholy Dreams imagine
themselves to be grievously beaten by the said <i>Maboya</i>. But there are sufficient testimonies
to prove, that these <i>Heathens</i> have often really suffer’d much by this <i>Maboya</i>,
often appearing to them in such horrid shapes, that the poor <i>Caribbeeans</i> would sweat
and quake at the sight thereof, and inflicting such sad Pinches and bloody Stripes
all over their Bodies, that they liv’d in perpetual fear of this evil Spirit: and yet
notwithstanding these cruel Sufferings, they shew’d no manner of Worship to <i>Maboya</i>,
onely they believ’d that they had some ease, when they wore little Pictures
about their Necks, made resembling the Shapes in which <i>Maboya</i> appear’d to them;
but their best Remedy was to flye to the <i>Christians</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Consultations about the Death of any Relation.</div>

<p class='c010'>They believe their <i>Boyez</i> able to resolve any Question they ask of them; particularly,
when any one dies, the nearest ally’d to him asks the <i>Boye</i> this Question, <i>Who
is the occasion of his Death?</i> to which if the <i>Boye</i> names any one, they never rest till
they have dispatch’d him to the other World. Concerning their original brutish
way of living, they give much credit to an ancient Fable, which is to this effect:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fabulous Tradition.</div>

<p class='c010'>The most antient <i>Caribbeeans</i>, living under no other Roof than the Canopy of
Heaven, fed on nothing but what the Fields naturally produc’d, which salvage
Life an old Man much beamoan’d; when a certain Deity clad in white Apparel
descending down on the Earth, said, <i>That he would have come sooner to have shew’n them
the way of a civil Life, had they requested it before</i>. Moreover, the Angel shew’d them a
place along the Shore where there lay sharp-cutting Stones, with which he told
them they might cut down Trees, and with the Timber build themselves Houses,
and cover them with the Leaves of the Palm-Tree to keep out the Rain; which
said, he broke his Staff into three pieces, which being Planted, soon after produc’d
the Root <i>Manioe</i>, which stamp’d and dry’d, made good Bread.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Opinion concerning the Soul.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Caribbeeans</i> have also a strange Opinion concerning the Soul, that is to say,
That every one hath as many Souls as he hath Pulses, but the chiefest is the Heart
it self, which after Death removes with <i>Jeheizi</i>, (that is every ones peculiar God or
Genius) to the Company of the other Deities, where they live after the same manner
as here on Earth; wherefore those that are Persons of Quality give Charge at
their Deaths, that their Servants may be kill’d and buried with them, that so they
may serve them in the other World; That the other Souls, which are the Pulses,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>are of two sorts, whereof the first call’d <i>Maboya</i>’s, range through Woods and Wildernesses;
and the other call’d <i>The Oumekous</i>, reside along the Sea, and over-turn
the Ships that Sail by; That the Souls of Heroes remove to pleasant and delightful
Islands, where they are serv’d by the <i>Arovages</i>; That Cowards at their Death go
behind a high Mountain, where they become perpetual Slaves to the <i>Arovages</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>So soon as they hear a clap of Thunder they run into their Huts, and place
themselves on little Stools round the Fire, cover their Faces, and laying their
Heads on their Knees, make a doleful noise, as supposing that <i>Maboya</i> is exceedingly
enrag’d against them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their manner of Dwelling.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Huts, for the most part built near Rivers and Streams, are of an
oval fashion, their Roofs made of Palm-Tree Leaves or Sugar-Canes, the Walls
nothing but Boughs set in the Ground and pleited together, and the Floor of
sifted Earth or Sand, rammed in and kept very even and smooth; besides a Room
wherein they Sleep and Entertain their Friends, they have also a Kitchin to dress
their Meat, and a place to lay their Bowes, Arrows, Clubs, and the like, in; they
use Mats in stead of Walls, to separate one Apartment from the other. Their Houshold-stuff
is little; the richest of them have Hammocks in stead of Beds; the
meaner sort use Sticks laid cross one another, and cover’d thick with the Leaves of
the <i>Banana</i>-Tree, made fast at the four corners with Cords. Hollow <i>Calabashes</i>, and
Earthen Ware call’d <i>Canaris</i>, serve them for their Kitchin Utensils. In the little
<i>Canaris</i> they prepare their <i>Tumalis</i>, or <i>Pepper-pottage</i>, and in the biggest their Liquor
<i>Ovicou</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Cleanliness may appear by this, that when they go to ease Nature, they
make a Hole in the Ground with a Stick, and after they have done, stop it up again,
burying their Excrement that it may not be seen.</p>

<p class='c010'>Round about their Huts feed many Hens and Turkies, which they breed not so
much for their own use, as to exchange for Iron.</p>

<p class='c010'>They remove their Habitations very often, either out of fear of being haunted
by the Ghost of some deceased Person, or to avoid some Smell which they find
noisom and offensive, or because their Hut hath been set on fire by Lightning.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Houshold Affairs and Diet.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Women are always employ’d to keep their Families in good order, to prepare
Venison and Fish for the Mens Tables, to spin Cotton, Comb their Husbands,
and paint them Red. The Men spend their time in the Wars, Hunting or
Fishing. They have also learn’d of the <i>Europeans</i> to burn Train-Oyl in Lamps in
the Night, when as before they burnt Twigs of a gummy Shrub before mention’d,
which for that reason the <i>Hollanders</i> call’d <i>Candle-Wood</i>. Each hath a little Stool, and
a Table call’d <i>Mantoutou</i>, on which he eats his Meat when he pleases, having no
set-Meals. The broad <i>Banana</i>-Leaves serve them for Napkins and Table-clothes.
Their chiefest Dainty is Crabs roasted in the Shell with the Juice of Lemmon and
<i>Pyman</i>. At great Feasts they dress their Meat with the Fat of their Enemies, being
the <i>Arovages</i>. Their usual Drink is <i>Mabby</i>, made of <i>Potato</i>’s, which refreshes, and
is good against the Phlegm; also another Liquor call’d <i>Oko</i> made of steep’d <i>Cassadar</i>,
and is like Beer in taste, strength, and colour. They also by making an incision
into the Palm-Trees, tap a Liquor from the same in <i>Calabashes</i>, like White-wine.
They use little of the Drink <i>Couscou</i>, because it swells the Body, notwithstanding
it is pleasing to the Palate; But the Liquor which is most esteem’d amongst them,
is the Wine made of the Sugar-Canes, which are squeez’d in Mills made for that
purpose, and then boyl’d in great Kettles. During the dressing of their Meat (which
being done leisurely, is sometimes half a day before it is ready), they Sing, and
Dance to the Time, which one keeps with a <i>Calabash</i> fill’d full of little Stones, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>which they believe the greatest happiness they shall enjoy in the other World consists:
But the <i>Caribbeeans</i> never Dance more antique than when they meet in the
<i>Carbet</i>, which is a publick House of Entertainment; whether the Women carry a
Drink made of <i>Cassave</i>, which makes Drunk as soon as Wine: The Men bring
Fish and Hedge-hogs; all of them painted with <i>Roucou</i>, and adorn’d with Plumes
of Feathers, commit all manner of Debaucheries. At other times they also keep
Feast-days, which is either when they are preferr’d to some Office, or Place of Honor,
or when they have defeated their Enemies, or when they mourn for the Death
of one of their nearest Relations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Beasts.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Boats, which they call <i>Periaquo</i>’s, are made of single hollow Trees, full
of Benches, and painted with several strange Shapes, and are able each to carry fifty
or sixty Men.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Musical Instruments.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Musical Instruments in which they take most delight, are Drums, Strings
of Silk-grass stretcht upon <i>Calabashes</i>, and Flutes made of the Bones of their Enemies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their watchfulness against Enemies.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Entertainment of Friends.</div>

<p class='c010'>They keep Watches on high Hills, to descry the Ships off at Sea, and no sooner
have they espy’d one, but they immediately give notice to one another; whereupon
those that are most valiant put off to Sea in their <i>Canoos</i> and know by the Languages
to distinguish between a <i>Spaniard</i>, <i>French</i>-man, <i>English</i>-man and <i>Hollander</i>.
If they find that ’tis an Enemy who Lands on their Coasts, they guard all their
Avenues, lie in Ambuscades, and gather together in by-ways, and where they see
any advantage they shoot thousands of Arrows; which done, they fall in amongst
them with great Clubs: but if they chance to be defeated, then they lurk behind
Bramble-bushes, or climb up inaccessible Mountains, or else, if near the Sea, they
save themselves by Diving and Swimming under Water above two hundred Paces
before they appear again; and if a Party of them chance to meet together afterwards,
they venture a second Engagement; But if those that come on their Coasts
are Friends, they Swim, or go in their Boats to meet them, climb up their Ships,
and carry the Sea-men on their Shoulders ashore, where the <i>Casique</i> in the Name of
the whole Island bids them welcome, and conducts them to the <i>Carbet</i>, where an
antient Man salutes the old Men, and a Youth the young Men; after which asking
their Names, the <i>Couban</i> calls himself by that Name ever after; and desires the
Strangers to accept of his Name; during which their changing of Names they use
many Ceremonies of Friendship: this done, they proffer them Cotton Hammocks
to rest themselves in, and pleasant Fruit to eat, till they have prepar’d other
Meat; which is no sooner Ready, but a little Table is set before every one of
them, and a Dish of Meat consisting of boyl’d Hedge-hogs, boyl’d Crabs, and Pot-herbs;
which if the Guests do not eat heartily, or drink up all the Liquor which
they give them, they take it as a great Affront; but if they eat and drink heartily,
they take it kindly, and shew great sorrow at their departure.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Offices of Government have been usually three; the meanest belong’d to
the <i>Tiouboulihauthe</i>, whose Place was to Govern over the <i>Carbet</i>, a House where Strangers
were Entertain’d, Matters of War disputed of, and publick Feasts kept. <i>Tiouboutonti</i>
Commanded the <i>Canoos</i> in the time of War, that is, under the <i>Nahalene</i>, who
Commanded the whole Fleet: But the chiefest Officer of all was the <i>Ouboutou</i>; to
which degree of Honor none attain’d, unless he had kill’d several <i>Arovages</i>, or at
least a Governor.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the <i>Caribbeeans</i> drew all their Forces out of the Islands to a Battel, then
they chose one out of the <i>Ouboutou</i>, who during their March Commanded the
Army as General, which his Office ended with the War, and extended no farther
than his own Island.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their warlike Consultations.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>Their warlike Consultations were no less observable for the <i>Ouboutou</i> appointed
a Day, on which the Islanders met at a Feast in the <i>Carbet</i>, whither they
accordingly came all at the time appointed, and having Eat and Drunk, and
Danc’d a considerable time, an ancient Woman with tears in her Eyes, and mournful
Countenance enter’d the <i>Carbet</i>, and desir’d Audience; which being granted her,
and every one silent, she began to relate the Damages which from antient times
the <i>Arovages</i> did to the <i>Caribbeeans</i>; and that in the last Engagement so many valiant
Men were slain, and afterwards devour’d by them; therefore it would be a
shame not to take Revenge, which being seconded by the <i>Ouboutu</i>, put Valor into
the Hearts of all that were present: Whereupon the following day Messengers
were sent to the other Islands to acquaint them with their Intentions, that they
might prepare their Clubs, make sharp and poyson their Arrows, String their
Bowes, prepare Provisions, and fit out their <i>Canoos</i>: They poyson’d their Arrows
with the Juice of <i>Manchenillo</i>’s, which made the least Wound mortal. Their Provisions
and Arms they laid up in their <i>Canoos</i>, so to preserve their <i>Periaguo</i>’s (which
are Boats that can carry fifty Men), if they should chance to over-set, which often
happen’d, though they were soon turn’d up again. They went from one Island to
another, where they not onely stor’d themselves with fresh Provisions, but increas’d
their Fleet with new Assistants; with which approaching the Main, they hal’d their
Boats ashore in the Evening, and driving four Stakes into the Ground under the
Trees, made fast their Hammocks to the same, in which they slept till Mid-night,
and then fell on their Enemies, but if discover’d by them, they retreated to their
Boats and return’d home; but if they were not discover’d, they fell upon the Huts
of the <i>Arovages</i>; who resisting, they shot Arrows with burning Cotton into them,
and so setting them on fire, forc’d the <i>Arovages</i> to venture a Battel in the open Field;
where having spent all their Arrows, they Engag’d one another with great Clubs,
with which at one Blow they broke either Arms or Legs, or knock’d out their
Brains. If the <i>Caribbeeans</i> chanc’d to be defeated, then those that remain’d of their
Party made a lamentable noise, howling for those that were kill’d, and mix’d their
Tears with the Blood of their slain Friends, whom not without the greatest danger
they fetch’d from amongst their Enemies, and carried them aboard their Boats:
But returning Victors, the were wont to insult over their Prisoners with all the
bitter Taunts imaginable, and then taking advantage of those sharp Upbraidings
which their cruel usage extorted from them, to put them to death with most inhumane
Tortures, and then to Feast themselves upon their mangled Bodies, all
claiming a Right to their several Prisoners, as to so many Beasts appointed to the
Slaughter; But of late Ages they have contented themselves to dispatch them speedily
with their Clubs, and so assign them to their Shambles.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Enmity to the <i>Spaniard</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>As the <i>Arovages</i> had been formerly, so the <i>Spaniards</i> at length became the Object
of the <i>Caribbeeans</i> irreconcileable Hatred, insomuch that oft-times being Invaded by
them, they gave them such rough Entertainment, that they were glad to save themselves
by flight; for the <i>Caribbeeans</i> not regarding their Guns, press’d upon them,
and many times took Vessels richly laden from them, till of late years that a Peace
hath been concluded between them; wherein nevertheless those of the <i>Caribbeeans</i> refuse
to be concern’d, that inhabit <i>St. Dominico</i> and <i>St. Vincent</i>, who cannot to this
day forget the cruel Outrages committed by the <i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Marriages.</div>

<p class='c010'>To come to their Marriages, they were allow’d as many Wives as they pleas’d
to have, insomuch that their Governors were in esteem according to the number of
their Wives; nor were degrees of Consanguinity so regarded, but that an Uncle
might take his Neece; whom he no sooner had carried to his House, but the Marriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>was finish’d. They seldom Divorc’d their Wives after they had bore them
Children, but otherwise the Man would break the Bond of Matrimony when he
pleas’d. A young Man that had no Relation might court a Stranger, and if her
Parents allow’d of it, the Match was made. One that had behav’d himself valiantly
against the <i>Arovages</i> was sure of several good Matches, for he was refus’d by
none whom he Courted; and the abundance of Wives was the greatest testimony
of their Valor. Each Wife had a peculiar Dwelling, so to prevent all Dissentions:
So soon as one of them was with Child, her Husband Lay not with her till after
Delivery. If any Woman committed Adultery, her Husband was permitted to
knock out her Brains, or rip open her Belly; which done, he acquainted her Father
with the Deed, who return’d him thanks for the same. Murderers were either
burnt or cut in pieces. Children were born here with little trouble, for the
Women were no sooner Deliver’d, but they carried the Infant to wash at the next
Brook; which done they return’d home to their Houshold Labor, whilest the Man
on the contrary kept his Bed, and ate nothing but a piece of <i>Cassava</i> Bread, which
he hollow’d out in the middle, and left the edges till the Feast, which was kept
at the Naming of the Child: Moreover, he fed on all manner of Dainties for a
whole year after. But this Custom was observ’d onely at the Birth of the first Son,
at which time they scratch’d the Father’s Shoulder with a sharp Curry-combe, at
which if he flinch’d not, it was accounted a good Omen of the Childs future Valor.
At fifteen days old they made Holes in the Childs Ears, Lips, and Nostrils, through
which they put a String for the tying on of what-ever Ornamentals. With the like
Ceremonies the Child receiv’d a Name, taken from his Predecessors, Trees, Fishes,
or some remarkable Passages during the Mothers bearing of the Infant in her
Womb, or of the Father’s Lying-in: But this Name was chang’d so soon as they
went to War, or kill’d a Commander of the <i>Arovages</i>, whose Name they exchang’d
for their own: After which the Mothers took special care in bringing them up,
and at six Moneths the Children were able to run alone: When they attain’d to
the age of two years, they cut off their Hair, at a great Feast made for that purpose;
from which time forward they exercis’d them in Shooting with Bowes and Arrows;
to which purpose they hung up pieces of Meat for them to shoot at, which
they must either hit down, or Fast.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Initiation of Soldiers.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Ceremonies to make Soldiers were very strange, <i>viz.</i> The Father conducted
his Son to the <i>Carbet</i>, where he told him the Duties of a Soldier, beat him
with a Bird of prey, call’d <i>Mans-fenis</i>, till he had bruis’d the Head of the Bird, and
scratch’d his whole Body all over with a Curry-combe till the Blood came, and
then put Lemmon Juice into the Wounds, afterwards put him in a Hammock, and
hung him up for several days without giving him any Meat; all which Torments
and Trials if he endur’d with patience, then he was accounted a good and approved
Soldier.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of their Priests.</div>

<p class='c010'>Few bred up their Children to be <i>Boyez</i> or Priests; yet those that were brought
up to it, abstain’d from certain Food from their Infancy, and before they could be
receiv’d into the Order of Priesthood, they were forc’d to draw Blood from every
part of their Bodies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Great age of the <i>Caribbeeans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Caribbeeans</i> attain to an exceeding great Age: <i>Charles de Rotchfort</i> witnesseth,
That in his time there liv’d Men who remembred the first Arrival of the <i>Spaniards</i>
under the Command of <i>Christopher Columbus</i>, which consider’d, they could not be less
than each of them a hundred and sixty years old. Many Women also were found
there, who bare Children after they were eighty years of age: yet nevertheless they
are not free from Sicknesses and Distempers, which cannot justly be attributed to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>Climate, that being extraordinary healthful, but to their ill Diet. Besides the troublesom
Disease call’d <i>Pyans</i>, which makes their Bodies swell full of great Knobs,
they have been much troubled with pestilential Sores, occasion’d by the eating of
Crabs, and poysonous Tortoises, <i>Lamantins</i>, and Hedg-hogs. Against which Evils
they wanted not Medicines, consisting of Herbs, Roots, Gums, and Oyl. The bitter
Bark of the <i>Chipiou</i>-Tree, steep’d in Water, and mix’d with <i>Lanbys</i>, hath a soveraign
operation. The like vertue is in the Juyce of the <i>Myby</i>-Tree, which they us’d
to take inwardly: and for outward Means, they us’d a Salve made of burnt Cane-ashes,
temper’d with a Water press’d out of a certain Tree. To draw the Matter
out of the Sores, they us’d the Juice of <i>Junipa</i>. Letting Blood was never customary
amongst them, but to cut and scratch the sore part was to them in stead of Phlebotomy.
But if all the fore-mention’d Medicines would not help them, they fled for
aid to the <i>Boyez</i>, who immediately order’d the Hut wherein the Patient lay to be
made clean, the Table call’d <i>Matoutou</i> to be over-spread with <i>Cassave</i>, <i>Ouycou</i>, and
Garden Fruits, for an Offering to the evil Spirit <i>Maboya</i>, and as many Stools to be
plac’d about the same as there were People to be present at the Ceremony; and after
that all the Fire and Candles were put out, the <i>Boye</i> enter’d into the Hut about
Midnight with a Lighted Roll of Tobacco, then muttering some words to himself,
stamp’d with his left Foot, and blew the Smoak of the Tobacco up into the Air,
which done, and tearing the Tobacco in pieces, he threw the same over the Hut,
and call’d up his Spirit, who shaking the Roof of the House, made a terrible noise;
then the <i>Boye</i> drew near to the Patient, suck’d his Sores, and anointed them with
the Juice of <i>Junipa</i>; after which if the sick Person recover’d, he made a great
Feast, and an Offering to the aforesaid Spirit: But if the Distemper were mortal,
then the <i>Boye</i> inform’d the Patient’s Relations, That his Spirit had compassion upon
the Sick, and was resolv’d to carry him above the Stars, to accompany the other
Gods which reside there.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus much in general of the Inhabitants of the Isles that lie before <i>Northern
America</i>; it will next be requisite to give you an Account of them in particular.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The number of the <i>Caribbee</i> Islands.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Their several Names.</div>

<p class='c010'>There are generally reckon’d of these Islands twenty eight by Name, though
there are many more in number; for besides that there are a multitude of small obscure
Islands that are not nam’d, there are of the more considerable sometimes two
or three that go under one Name; the twenty eight are these following: <i>Anegada</i>,
<i>Sombrero</i>, <i>Las Virgines</i>, <i>Anguilla</i>, <i>Saba</i>, <i>St. Crux</i>, <i>St. Martin</i>, <i>St. Bartholomew</i>, <i>Barbouthos</i> or
<i>Barboude</i>, <i>Rotonda</i>, <i>Nevis</i>, <i>Eustathius</i>, <i>Antego</i>, <i>Montserrat</i>, <i>Guadalupe</i>, <i>Deseado</i>, <i>Marigalanta</i>,

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Colibry</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Towards the North-East of <i>Porto Rico</i>, at eighteen Degrees and thirteen Minutes,
lies <i>Anegada</i>, seven Leagues long, surrounded with Shoals and
Banks, as also the neighboring <i>Sombrero</i>, being in the same Latitude with
the other, and so call’d by the <i>Spaniard</i>, because it appears like a Hat: Both of them
being uninhabited, harbor abundance of Birds, amongst which is the <i>Mansfeny</i>,
a little Eagle, and the remarkable <i>Colibry</i>, whose Body being a little bigger than a
<i>Wren</i>, is adorn’d with divers colour’d Feathers, resembling a Rain-bowe; about
its Neck is a Carbuncle red Circle; the Belly and ends of the Feathers are of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>Golden colour, the Sides of an Emerauld green, the Bill and Legs black like polish’d
Ebony, the Eyes glittering like Diamonds, on the Head a curious green tuft
of Feathers: the Cocks far exceed the Hens in beauty; they flie swifter than any
Bird whatsoever, and the fluttering of their Wings makes a noise like a Whirlwind:
they live upon the Juice of Flowers, and especially of Cotton-Flowers;
they smell like Amber, and build their Nests amongst the thick Leaves of a little
Bough, where they cannot easily be found; the Nest it self open towards the South,
is curiously made of the fine Fibres of the Plant <i>Pite</i>, surrounded with pieces of
Bark, and within fill’d with Cotton, douny Feathers, and Silk; the Eggs oval, are
somewhat bigger than an ordinary Pearl.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Painted Crabs.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>In the Moneth of <i>May</i> that sort of Crabs call’d <i>Painted Crabs</i> (for some have
Violet-colour’d Shells, others yellow, full of purple Specks, and others tawny, with
red Streaks) come creeping down the Hills in good order, eat up all the Herbs and
Plants, and go four times one after another into the Water to wash themselves,
which done they return to the Woods; but the Females at a set-time betake themselves
to the Sea, in which they Lay their Eggs, which afterwards being cast on the
sandy Shore, and warm’d by the Beams of the Sun, produce young Crabs in a
short time, which no sooner come out of the Shell, but creep towards the Woods,
when grown somewhat bigger they climb up the Rocks, where the old ones keep
in vast multitudes, and stop up the Entrance of their Holes in such a manner, that
they cannot be found out, whilest they cast off their Shell, creeping out backward
through an opening at the Tail scarce discernable; thus for a certain time they lie
bare, and stript of their Shells, being onely cover’d with a thin Skin, which growing
harder and harder, becomes at last a firm Shell like the former.</p>

<p class='c010'>These Crabs are a wholsom Meat, unless they feed under the <i>Mancheneel</i>-Trees,
which commonly are poysonous.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Near <i>Sombrero</i>, at eighteen Degrees, lie also the two Isles <i>Las Virgines</i>, surrounded
by ten others (and flat Shelves), without Trees or fresh Water;
but the Sea thereabouts abounds with Fish, and chiefly with the <i>Perroket</i>,
which hath Scales like a Carp, but greenish; the Eyes surrounded with Silver Circles
shine very bright; in stead of Teeth they have strong Jaw-bones, wherewith
they Grind all manner of Shell-fish, which are their Prey. These Fish have an excellent
Rellish, and weigh generally twenty Pound.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fish <i>Dorade</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Here is likewise great plenty of the <i>Dorade</i>, which is a very large Fish, and about
five Foot long, full of little Scales, with a prickly Back, two Fins at the parting of
the Head, and as many under the Belly. This Fish swimming very swift, oftentimes
follows the Ships that Sail that way.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Situation of <i>Anguilla</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Southward at eighteen Degrees and twenty Minutes, on this side of the Line,
appears <i>Anguilla</i>, inhabited by the <i>English</i>, containing ten Leagues in length;
It makes a pleasant Prospect, because of the many <i>Junipa</i>-Trees which grow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>upon the same, whose Boughs bend towards the Ground; the Leaves are not unlike
those of an Oak; the Flowers both in smell and shape come near the <i>Narcissus</i>;
the Wood firm and grey, may be neatly Plan’d; the Tree bears fresh Leaves every
Moneth, and a Fruit like Apples, which generally crack in their fall from the Tree,
because of their thin Shell, as hath been already describ’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Oculiem</i> a sort of Vine</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Oculiem</i>, or Vine, makes the Shore also very pleasant; the Leaf round and
thick, hath a mixture of Red and Green; the Bark incloseth a Violet-colour’d
Wood; the Boughs whereof are loaded with Violet Grapes, which in stead of Kernels
contain hard Stones.</p>

the <i>Spaniards</i> alive. The Soil, though Hilly, is rich and fruitful.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>English</i> Landing here <i>Anno 1587.</i> found a standing Pool, whose Water made

<div class='sidenote'>The several Changes of Dominion in this Island.</div>

<p class='c010'>Since the <i>Spaniards</i> destroy’d the Inhabitants of this Island, it lay desolate for a
considerable time, notwithstanding it hath fourteen Leagues in length, and little
less in breadth, till at last the <i>English</i> and <i>Hollanders</i> took possession of the same, each
in a peculiar place; but not agreeing together, the <i>English</i> fell upon the <i>Hollanders</i>,
and made themselves Masters of the Island in 1649. and not long after they were
serv’d in the same kind; for the <i>Spaniard</i> judging them to be weakned by the <i>Hollanders</i>
removing from the Island, set Sail thither from <i>Porto Rico</i>, burnt all the Houses,
slew the Inhabitants, and brought <i>St. Crux</i> again under the <i>Spanish</i> Government.
Mean while the Lord <i>Poincy</i> fitted out two Sail of <i>French</i> Ships, to drive the <i>Spaniards</i>
from <i>St. Crux</i>, and succeeded in his Enterprize; for the <i>Spaniards</i> immediately
fled to their Ships, left at liberty some <i>Holland</i> Prisoners whom they had taken, and
the Island in possession of the <i>French</i>; who straightway sent Captain <i>Auger</i> thither
as Governor, who design’d to build a Fort to secure the Harbor, but died before the
same was finish’d. <i>Poincy</i> succeeding him, made an end of the Fort, and stor’d the
Island with Ammunition and Provision. The Cross-Church built there by the Order,
and at the Cost of a Company of <i>Flushing</i> in <i>Holland</i>, was deliver’d also to the
<i>French</i>.</p>

reason that Fleet was re-inforc’d with a considerable Supply, they set Sail <i>Anno

found the Place in this condition: On the right side of the City glides a fresh-Water
River, with many meandring Streams from the Mountains; on the left side
the Ocean makes a great Opening or Bay, which for a little space growing narrower,
becomes at last an Inland Lake; from the Countrey opposite to the City on the

the Mouth of the River appears a strong Castle with several Bulwarks, and thereon
great Guns; along the Inlet is a fair Market-place; in the middle of the City
stands a Church Consecrated to <i>Dominicus</i>, near which there is a large Hospital,
which fronts the Sea; the Cathedral stands at the farther end of the City, and
on the declivity of a Mountain a fair Chappel; near the great Fort the Governor

theirs upon the first gaining of the Island; which the <i>Hollanders</i> allowing them, they
liv’d peaceably and quietly together, each having their own Churches, Store-houses,
Land, and <i>Negro</i>’s. The <i>Dutch</i> Plantation was maintain’d by the <i>Zealand</i>

<p class='c010'>There are divers Pools of salt Water in this Island, which afford the Inhabitants

<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Description of <i>St. Bartholomew</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Near <i>St. Martin</i>, at sixteen Degrees, lies the Island <i>St. Bartholomew</i>, which being
about five Leagues in circumference, is surrounded with Rocks, and
was first Planted by <i>De Poincy</i>: It makes a delightful Prospect, because of
the many Trees which grow on the same; amongst which the most noted are
Soap-Trees, whose Wood makes the Water Lather, and washes as well as Soap;
but they are of two sorts, for in some this soapy Quality is contain’d in a round
yellow Fruit, not unlike a Plumb; in others a white soft Root supplies the office.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Canopia</i>-Tree.</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_421.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>The little Tree <i>Canopia</i>, out of whose Bark drops a Gum, grows also very pleasant,
the Body being divided into several Branches; the Leaves are discolour’d, being
underneath of a dark Green, and of a brighter at the top; the Flower consists of
five Leaves, and closes at last into a kind of Cherry, full of yellow Juice, and white
Pulp; it blossoms generally in <i>October</i> and <i>December</i>, and bears ripe Berries the two
following Moneths: a Fire being made about the Tree causeth the Bark to crack,
whereby it yields abundance of Gum, chiefly us’d in Medicine for its opening and
loosening Quality.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Paretuve</i>-Tree.</div>

<p class='c010'>Likewise the <i>Paretuve</i>-Tree, which grows along by the Sea-side and by Pools, is
sufficiently remarkable, for the Boughs thereof grow downwards, twin’d and pleited
together so thick, that in time of War they serve for Bulwarks, and are the Recesses
of wild Swine.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Calabash</i>-Tree.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, on this Island, as on all the other hereabouts, grow <i>Calabash</i>-Trees,
which have thick Boughs and oval Leaves joyn’d one to another, and bear every
Moneth fresh Flowers and Fruit, grey Flowers, mark’d with green Streaks and
black Spots, and Fruit with hard Shells, full of juicy Meat and flat Seeds, which
being taken out serve for Boxes, Cups, or little Dishes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sea-Star.</i></div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>Along the Shore is also found a sort of Fish call’d the <i>Sea-Star</i>, which is a yellowish

in stormy Weather they fasten themselves to the Rocks.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sea-Apple.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>No less wonderful is the Fish call’d the <i>Sea-Apple</i>, whose brown Skin is full of
Prickles, which when the Fish dies fall off, nothing remaining but a white Shell,
curiously embroider’d with little Holes.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the Banks, and near the Rocks, grow also Sea-Trees, whose thickest Boughs
putting forth still lesser and lesser Branches, are pleited together very wonderfully,
and being all glaz’d as it were with Salt-petre, seem greyish.</p>

Mountain all over wooddy; round about which the <i>English</i>, who Setled there
<i>Anno 1628.</i> have their Plantations, and have increased from a small number to
above three thousand, and make a good Advantage of their Sugar, Ginger, Cotton,
and Tobacco, which they Plant there.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Good Government of the <i>English</i> there.</div>

<p class='c010'>They are Govern’d by a peculiar Governor and a Council, who punish Thieves,
and all manner of Deboshes very severely.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are also three Churches, which on the Sabbath-Day are all throng’d with
People, who resort thither for the Worship and Service of God.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Harbor call’d <i>Bath-Bay</i>, and the Store-house built about the same, are secured
by a great Fort full of great Guns.</p>

<p class='c010'>Several Springs on this Island afford the Inhabitants good Water. Here is also
a Mineral Spring, a place to Bathe in, which hath been found to cure the same Distempers
which the Waters at <i>Bourbon</i> have done.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Pistick</i>-Nut.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>Moreover, this Island abounds with the <i>Pistacie</i> or <i>Pistick</i>-Nuts, which grow on
small Trees, with soft long Leaves, round at bottom, and ending in three Points:
These Trees being commonly full of thick Boughs, serve commodiously for
Hedges; the Wood and Leaves sweat a milky Juice, dropping out of the same with
the Rain; the yellow Flowers which grow on the same are like glittering Stars,
and the taste of the Nuts like a Hazle; but if the Skin which covers the Kernel
be not pull’d off before they are eaten, they purge to Death.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Musticho</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>But the great Profit which <i>Nevis</i> receives by Nature is attended with some Inconveniences,
which trouble this and all the other Islands: amongst many may be
reckon’d the <i>Musticho</i>’s, a sort of little Bugs, whose poysonous Sting causes such intolerable
Itching, that those who are stung by them cannot forbear to scratch themselves
till the Blood comes, by which their Sores festering, prove often very dangerous.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Muringoins</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Also the <i>Muringoins</i>, who are so much the less dangerous, because they make always
a great noise before they sting.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wasps likewise are here very troublesom, but their Stings are cur’d with Rue,
as the Stings of Scorpions are with the Juice press’d out of the same Animal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Wood-Lice.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Wood-Lice, which are here in great abundance, have a soft and white Body,
onely the Head, which is mark’d with a black Speck; their Mouthes are so
very hard, that in two hours time they eat through thick Chests. And no less damage
do the <i>Banettos</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Chigos</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>But the <i>Chigos</i> are a kind of small Fleas, that breed in Dust, Ashes, and the like, and
are of all the most pernicious; they first get in under the Nails of the Toes, and
from thence run over all the Body, but especially the bottoms of the Feet, where
they first occasion an Itching, and then eat Holes through the Skin; they make Blisters
as big as Pease in the Flesh, wherein a swarm of young ones breeding, cause
Ulcers and rotten Flesh, which must be eaten away with <i>Aqua-fortis</i> and burnt

scarce five Leagues in circumference, yet receiv’d some while since a Colony
of above sixteen hundred People, sent thither from the <i>States</i> of the <i>United Netherlands</i>,
under the Command of the Lords <i>Lampsen</i> and <i>Ree</i>. Besides the natural
Strength of the Place, whereby a few are able to keep off a great number, it is fortifi’d
with a strong Fort, which Commands the Harbor. The Inhabitants are very
industrious, and make great profit of the Tobacco which they Plant.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the midst of this Island is a Mountain over-grown with Trees, which seems
to end in a Point, and hath about it a pleasant Plain.</p>

<p class='c010'>The abundance of Fowls, Hogs and Goats, afford the Inhabitants store of Provisions;
for their Store-houses are never so empty, but that they can supply their
Neighbors Wants.</p>

<p class='c010'>The want of fresh-water Brooks they supply with Rain-water, which they preserve
in Cisterns.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Terrible Hurricanes.</div>

<p class='c010'>Though the Air of the Island be wholsom, and the Soil fruitful, yet it is subject
to many great Inconveniences; for besides the terrible Thunder-claps and Earthquakes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>that rend the Ground, the Inhabitants are exceedingly troubled in <i>August</i>,
and <i>September</i> with the Winds, which in twenty four hours blow from all Points of
the Compass with such mighty Gusts, as if they would turn all things into their
first <i>Chaos</i>. The <i>Caribbeeans</i> call these Tempests <i>Hurricanes</i>, which formerly us’d to
happen but once in seven years, but of late every two years, and sometimes twice
in a year. What damage these Winds cause is scarce to be express’d; the Sea raising
its turbulent Waves up to the Skyes, casts the Ships on the Shore, which though
in Harbor, are certain to be wrack’d, whilest the Land seems to labor under a general
Ruine, whole Woods being rooted up by the same, or at least bereav’d of
Boughs and Leaves; the Corn is beaten down, the Plants blasted, Houses turn’d
topsie-turvy, Mountains rent asunder, and sometimes pieces of Rocks blown into
the Sea. Before the Hurricanes there are several fore-runners, which give notice of
their sudden approach, <i>viz.</i> the Sea on a sudden is so calm, that the least motion is
not perceiv’d; the Birds flye from the Mountains into the Valleys, where they
lay themselves flat on the Ground; and the Rain which falls is bitter and salt.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Charles de Rochfort</i> observ’d, that in his time some Ships laden with Tobacco being
lost in a Hurricane before <i>St. Christophers</i>, soon after the Tempest ceased, thousands
of Fishes were seen swimming with their Bellies upwards, intoxicated no

come at with great Ships, because of the many Rocks which lie before it,
and remain’d the longer uninhabited, because of the want of fresh Water; yet at
last the <i>English</i> taking possession of it, digg’d Pits, and made Troughs to catch and

the Sword of it is a long Bone, arm’d on each side with twenty seven white

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Acomas</i>-Tree.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Acomas</i> is also no way inferior in bigness to the <i>Acajou</i>, which bears long

The Brain of this Fish is judg’d exceeding good against the Gravel and Stone.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The discovery of <i>Guadalupe</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Guadalupe</i> was first discover’d in the Year of our Lord 1635. by the <i>French</i>, under
the Command of the Lords <i>Du Plessis</i> and <i>De Olive</i>, and after them one of the Captains
of <i>St. Christophers</i>: Since which the Champain Ground being Till’d and Manur’d,
brings forth in great plenty, Rice, <i>Maiz</i>, <i>Manicock</i>, and Potato’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>Father <i>Raymond Breton</i> got possession of the fruitfullest part of the Island for the
Reformed <i>Jacobines</i>, or <i>White-Fryers</i>, and since the present Governor Monsieur <i>De
Howell</i> sent also for the <i>Jesuits</i> and <i>Carmelites</i>, to build Cloysters in a new City, which
lies in <i>Basse-Terre</i>, and which is also built full of Store-houses and Dwelling-houses
two Stories high.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Castle, which lies near the City, hath four Bulwarks, with great Guns.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next neighboring Mountain is also crown’d with a Garrison’d Fort.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Moubane</i>-Tree.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey hereabouts bears <i>Moubane</i>-Trees, which produce yellow oval
Plumbs with great Stones, wherewith the Hogs are exceedingly fatned.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Corbary</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Corbary</i>, which grows higher than the <i>Moubane</i>, hath a hard shelly Fruit, in
which lies a douny Pulp of a Saffron colour: The Gum which drops out of the
Tree is hardned by the Sun, and becomes very clear, wherefore the <i>Caribbeeans</i>
make use of it for Arm-rings, and other Ornaments.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Ten Leagues to the North-West of <i>Guadalupe</i>, and at sixteen Degrees and ten
Minutes, appears <i>Deseado</i>, or <i>Desirado</i>, like a Galley, of which the North-East
end hath a low Point; to the Northward lie Sand-Hills full of red
Veins: It was so call’d by <i>Christopher Columbus</i> in his second Voyage, from obtaining
of his Desire, it being the first of the <i>Caribbees</i> which he discover’d, as <i>St. Salvador</i>
the first Land in all <i>America</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Guano</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Soil is wholly barren, and destitute of Trees, and breeds the amphibious
Creatures call’d <i>Guano</i>’s, which in stead of Fins to swim withal, have four Feet;
the biggest of them are fifteen Inches long; their Skin full of little Scales shines
like Silver, and in the Night they make a loud and shrill noise from the Holes in
the Rocks.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Frigates</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>On this desolate Island are an innumerable company of Fowls, call’d <i>Frigates</i>,
which have a Body like a Duck, but larger Wings, and flye swifter; so soon as they
perceive a Fish in the Water, they falling upon the same, catch them in their Claws,
and especially devour abundance of flying Fish.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Fauves</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>But the <i>Fauves</i>, which are much leaner, are no way so swift; they resemble a
Moor-Hen, have Feet like Ducks, Bills like a Snipe, and in rainy Nights rest on
the Ships in stead of Rocks, so that many times they become an easie prey to the

Monsieur <i>De Howell</i> sent some People from that Island, of which twenty were
kill’d by the <i>Caribbeeans</i>, who had Gardens and Fish-ponds thereon: Not long after
which <i>Howell</i> built a Fort here, and Garrison’d the same with <i>French</i>-men.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Woods afford a delightful sight to the Eye, as also the Cinamon-Trees,
whose Leaves never wither, a sweet smell to the Nose.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fish <i>Lamantin</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Ocean hereabouts produces plenty of <i>Lamantins</i>, which are dry’d like Haberdine.
This Fish grows eighteen Foot long and seven thick; the Head thereof is
like a Cows, with little Eyes, and a thick brown Skin, rough and speckled in some
places, and hath two little Feet in stead of Fins; it feeds on Weeds, which grow on
the Rocks and Banks; the Females bring two young ones at a time, which suck for
some days; their Flesh palatable and wholsom, is streak’d with Fat, which when
melted never putrifies; they are oftner taken in the Mouthes of Rivers than in the

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Sea-Devils</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>About this Isle, as well as the rest of the <i>Caribbees</i>, are Fishes call’d <i>Sea-Devils</i>,
four Foot long, and proportionably thick, their Skins rough, their Heads flat, their
Backs arm’d with Prickles, little black Eyes, wide Mouthes full of Teeth, and two
Tusks that slick out of the same, four Fins, a long slit Tail, with which they swim
exceeding swift, above their Eyes slick broad sharp Horns turn’d towards the Back;
the Flesh is deadly poyson.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Becune</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Becune</i>, which is eight Foot long, falls upon a Fish like a mad Dog, biting

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Southward from <i>Guadalupe</i>, and at the same Latitude with <i>Marigalante</i>, lie four
desolate Isles, call’d <i>Todos Sanctos</i>, and on their Shores a sort of Shell-fish call’d

Sound in stead of Horns when they give an Alarm; as also another sort call’d <i>Porcelenes</i>,
of which the most esteem’d are without of a Carnation, and within of a
Silver, or Skye-colour mix’d with Golden Beams. The next are the Black, mix’d
with a pale Blue, and little Veins. But the most remarkable Shells are those, whose
Back Nature hath mark’d in such a manner with Musical Notes, that one might
almost express a Tune by them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Mother-of-Pearl Oysters.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, it would amaze the Beholder, to see the Mother-of-Pearl Oyster moving

and gape for the Dew, of which they have no sooner receiv’d a Drop, but they
close their Shells, and fall to the Ground again.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Aigrettos.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Besides Ducks, Pluvers, Moor-hens, Geese, and the like Fowls
(that suffer themselves to be catch’d by the Hands of Men, which are very strange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>to them) there are here also many rare sorts of Birds, as the white Birds call’d
<i>Aigrettos</i>, which are somewhat bigger than Crows, with red Bills and Feet, and
curious Plumes on their Heads; they often flye a great way off at Sea.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Craw-fowl.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The large Bird call’d <i>The Craw-fowl</i>, which feeds on Fish, hath a thick Head, a
long flat Bill, hollow Eyes, and a short Neck, under which hangs the Maw, big
enough to contain a Pail full of Water: On the Trees along the Sea-side they
watch for Fish which swim near the top of the Water, and by their attentiveness on
their Prey, are easily shot themselves.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Arras.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Here is likewise the Bird <i>Arras</i>, of the bigness of a Pheasant, but more resembling
a Parraquito: their long Tail consists of divers colour’d Feathers, some
have shining skye-colour’d Heads, Backs, and Necks, their Bellies and Wings of a
pale Yellow; they are so stout, or rather so simple, that if they are not hit with the
first Shot, they will stay for a second: They also learn to talk, but not so distinctly
as the <i>Canides</i>, which are no way inferior in beauty to the <i>Arras</i>, nay exceed
them very much: Monsieur <i>du Montell</i> above mention’d, seeing one at <i>Corassao</i>, describes
it after this manner:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the <i>Canides</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>“It deserves to be numbred (saith he) amongst the most beautiful Birds in the
World: I took so particular notice of it, having had of them in my Hands many
times, that I have the Idea’s of it still fresh in my Memory. Under the Belly,
Wings, and Neck, it was of a waving <i>Aurora</i>-colour, the Back, and one half of
the Wings, of a very bright Skye-colour, the Tail and greater Feathers of the
Wings were mix’d with a sparkling Carnation, diversifi’d with a Skye-colour,
as upon the Back a Grass-green and shining Black, which very much added to
the Gold and Azure of the other Plumage: But the most beautiful part was the
Head, cover’d with a Murrey Doun, checquer’d with Green, Yellow, and a pale
Blue, which reach’d down wavingly to the Back: The Eye-lids were white,
and the Apple of the Eye yellow and red as a Ruby Set in Gold: It had upon
the Head a certain Tuft or Cap of Feathers of a Vermilion Red, sparkling like a
lighted Coal, which was encompass’d by several other lesser Feathers of a Pearl-colour.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If it were recommendable for all these extraordinary Ornaments, it was much
more for its Familiarity and Innocency; for though it had a crooked Beak, and
that the Claws with which it held its Meat and brought it to its Beak, were so
sharp as to take away whatsoever it fastned upon, yet was it so tame as to play
with little Children and never hurt them; and when one took him into his Hand,
he so contracted his Claws, that the sharpness of them could not be felt: He had
this Quality of a Dog, That he would Lick with his short and thick Tongue
those who made much of him and gave him something he lik’d, put his Head to
their Cheeks to Kiss and Caress them, and expressing his Acknowledgments by
a thousand pretty Insinuations, he would suffer himself to be put into what posture
one would, and took a certain pleasure in diverting those he thought his
Friends: But as he was mild and tractable to those who were kind to him, so
was he mischievous and irreconcileable to such as had injur’d him, and he could
distinguish them from others, and make them feel the sharpness of his Beak
and Claws.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He pratled in the <i>Dutch</i>, <i>Spanish</i>, and <i>Indian</i> Languages, and in the last he sung Airs
as a natural <i>Indian</i>: He also imitated the Cries of all sorts of Poultrey and other
Creatures about the House; he call’d all his Friends by their Names and Sirnames,
flew to them as soon as he saw them, especially when he was hungry; if
they had been absent, and that he had not seen them a long time, he express’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>his joy at their return by certain merry Notes; when he had sported himself till
they were weary of him, he went away, and perch’d himself on the top of the
House, and there he talk’d, sung, and play’d a thousand tricks, laying his Feathers
in order, and dressing and cleaning himself with his Beak. He was easily
kept; for not onely the Bread commonly us’d in that Island, but all the Fruits
and Roots growing there, were his ordinary Food; and when he had more given
him than he needed, he carefully laid up the remainder under the Leaves
wherewith the House was cover’d, and took it when he had need. In a word, I
never saw a more loving or more amiable Bird; ’twas a Present for any Prince,
if he could have been brought over the Sea. This Bird had been brought from
the <i>Caribbee</i> Islands to Monsieur <i>Rodenborck</i>, then Governor of the Fort and <i>Dutch</i>
Colony, which is in the Island of <i>Corassao</i>.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>At fifteen Degrees and thirteen Minutes, lies the Island <i>Dominico</i>, so call’d because
it was discover’d on a <i>Sunday</i>, about thirty Leagues long, and not
much less in breadth, and diversifi’d with high Mountains, and exceeding
deep Valleys; of which the <i>Caribbeeans</i> that dwell there relate, That formerly in
one of the deepest of them, a huge and monstrous Serpent had an Army of Serpents
to defend an invaluable Carbuncle which he had in his Head; which being
cover’d with a thin Skin, was onely discernable when he drank or play’d, for then
the lustre thereof lightned the whole Valley.</p>

<p class='c010'>When first the <i>French</i> approach’d this Coast with their Ships, the Islanders going
Aboard in their <i>Canoos</i>, barter’d Provisions for Coral, Crystal, and other
Trifles.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Manchenile</i> Tree.</div>

<p class='c010'>On this Isle also grows the famous <i>Manchenile</i>-Tree, which bears long Leaves,
and sweet smelling Fruit, streak’d red, and tasting like a Hazle-Nut, but bringing
a deadly Sleep upon those that eat of it; it seldom rots though it fall into the Sea,
or any fresh Rivers, but is crusted over with a Shell resembling Salt-petre, and poysons
the Water in such a manner, that all the Fish dying, are seen floating upon it;
in the Trunk and Boughs thereof is a milky Juice, which dropping upon the Body,
causes it to break out in Scabs, and if it chances to touch the Eyes, it takes away the
Sight for nine days: and not less hurtful is the Moisture which drops from the
Tree.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Caribbeeans</i> dip their Arrows in this poysonous Juice, against which Nature
hath provided an excellent Medicine, being as followeth:</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Opposite to <i>Dominico</i> lies <i>Martinico</i>, by the <i>Indians</i> nam’d <i>Matunina</i>, which
lying at fourteen Degrees and thirty Scruples, is forty five Leagues in
circumference; It appears at a distance like three Mountains, the highest
whereof resembles a Hat, and is seen in all parts of the Island, which, on the North
where three Rocks deny access for Landing, seems to be divided into three Isles.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Caribbeeans</i> have been forc’d, after many bloody Battels, to surrender up this
Island to the <i>French</i>: But before they were well setled, the <i>Caribbeeans</i> marching
over exceeding high Mountains, deep Concavities, and thick Woods, fell upon
them with all the Rage imaginable: the Reasons of which some attribute to <i>Du
Parquet</i>, who in prejudice of the <i>Martinican Caribbeeans</i>, sent <i>French</i>-men over to <i>Granada</i>
and <i>Alouzia</i>: others suppose, that they took up Arms to revenge the Death of
their Countrey-men on <i>St. Vincent</i>, who were destroy’d by the <i>French</i> with poyson’d
Brandy. But the <i>French</i> furnish’d with new Supplies, took sufficient Revenge;
for they drove the <i>Caribbeeans</i> out of their Houses, and chac’d them into Woods
and Deserts.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Hills that are over-grown with Trees, are Receptacles for wild Beasts,
especially Hogs and Serpents. The other Hills are Till’d and Sow’n, though not
without great trouble.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Tobacco which grows on the steep Ascents much exceeds that which grows
in the Valleys, or in the Tracts of Land shaded with Trees.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Island divided into five Wards.</div>

<p class='c010'>Since the  <i>French</i>, <i>Anno 1635.</i> (being sent from <i>St. Christophers</i> by the Lord <i>Desnambuc</i>)
Setled themselves on this Island, under the Command of his Deputy <i>Du
Pont</i>, they divided it into five Wards, separated from that part of the Isle which
was inhabited by the antient Natives: Each Ward hath a Church, or at least a
Chappel, Armory, Store-houses, and Dwelling-houses, like an intire Village.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first Ward is call’d <i>Pyloot</i>, from a <i>Caribbeean</i> Captain, who was very familiar
with <i>Du Parquet</i>, and inform’d him of his Peoples Designs.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second, nam’d <i>Capot</i>, is wash’d by a River of the same Denomination, and
hath many fruitful Plains.</p>

<p class='c010'>The third retains the <i>Caribbeean</i> Name, being <i>Carbet</i>, signifying a Publick Structure,
to which they us’d to resort to Feast, or hold Councils of War; not far from
which the Governor dwelt in a Stone House: Near the Harbor stood also an Armory
in a Valley, water’d by a fresh River which falls out of the Mountains, shaded
with Trees and Gardens full of Rarities: But since the Governor gave this and
many other fair Buildings to the <i>Jesuits</i>, he remov’d to the fourth Ward, call’d
<i>St. Peter</i>, where he built a Castle, and furnish’d the same with Brass and Iron Guns
to defend the Harbor.</p>

<p class='c010'>A Stones-throw from the Governor’s House lies the <i>Jesuits</i> Cloyster, on the
Banks of a pleasant Stream, built very artificially of Marble and Free-stone, and
having a pleasant Prospect over the River, and adjacent Gardens, beautifi’d with
the choicest of Flowers, Fruits, and Trees; and also a Vineyard, out of which they
press a considerable quantity of Wine.</p>

<p class='c010'>The last Ward, call’d <i>Preacheur</i>, extends East and West, some parts whereof swell
into high Mountains, at the Feet whereof stand fair Structures; others sink into
low Valleys or <i>Savannas</i>.</p>

whose Shores grows abundance of the <i>Mahot</i>-Tree, which is full of Boughs from
the top down to the Ground. The Bark of this Tree serves in stead of Ropes, and is
also us’d to tie up Tobacco; the Wood it self is durable, and good for Building,
wherefore most of the Houses built on Hills are of this Timber.</p>

<p class='c010'>The best Harbor for Ships is between the Wards <i>Carbet</i> and <i>St. Peter</i>, defended
from the Winds by high Hills.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Diamond</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Not far from the Inlet of the Salt-pits, appears about half a League off at Sea, a
Rock call’d <i>The Diamond</i>, being a Receptacle for an innumerable multitude of Birds,
and especially wild Pigeons.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides the Streams that in the rainy Seasons run through the Dales and <i>Savana</i>’s,
there are ten Rivers, which falling from the Mountains, glide through the
Valleys into the Sea. Sometimes they swell in such a manner, that over-flowing
their Banks, they wash down the Trees and Houses; which Inconvenience hath
taught the <i>French</i> to build their Houses on Hills or rising Grounds.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>St. Lucia</i> (by the <i>French</i>, <i>Alouzie</i>) is so call’d because it was discover’d on the
thirteenth of <i>December</i>, Dedicated in the Kalendar to the Virgin Martyr <i>Lucia</i>,
who was burnt at <i>Syracuse</i>: It lies Southerly from <i>Dominico</i> at thirteen Degrees
and forty Minutes, and is ken’d at a great distance by two fiery Mountains;
the most Easterly of which is higher than the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the Feet of these two Mountains lie pleasant Valleys, shadow’d by close
Woods, and moistned by clear Springs; near which heretofore a small number of
<i>Caribbeeans</i> dwelling, maintain’d themselves with Fishing; they went stark naked,
and painted their Bodies with red Oker, and drew a Vermilion Stroke from their
Ears to their Noses.</p>

<p class='c010'>An <i>English</i> Ship sent to <i>Guinee</i> to supply the Plantations there, Landed sixty six
mutinous Persons here, who were all kill’d by the Inhabitants; but when <i>Henry
Jacobson Lucifer</i> putting into the Bay of <i>Lucia</i> to Water there, <i>Anno 1627.</i> Landed to
discover the Island, he found neither Man nor House, nor any thing but a barren
Soil; yet notwithstanding <i>Du Parquet</i> sent his Deputy <i>Rosselan</i> with a Colony to

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The Island <i>Barbados</i>, which was Planted by the <i>English</i>, <i>Anno 1627.</i> lies between
thirteen and fourteen Degrees, and hath twenty five Leagues in
circumference, and somewhat more in length than breadth, and is supply’d
with a fresh-Water River, and several Pools. The Ground being fruitful in the
producing of Tobacco, Cotton, Ginger, and especially Sugar, invited many People
to Settle there, insomuch that in a short time it could shew twenty thousand
Inhabitants besides <i>Negro</i> Slaves.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Trees which grow on this Island, are not onely delightful, but profitable;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>amongst which the <i>Roucou</i> is one, with sharp Leaves, white Carnation Flowers
like Stars, which hang by Clusters at the end of the Boughs, and after a while turn
to a Cod full of vermilion Kernels: The Juice dry’d in the Sun and kneaded into
Balls, is of a great value. Of the Bark of this Tree they make strong Ropes; and
the Root is very wholsom, and of a pleasant taste.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fly <i>Cayouyou</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, amongst the Insects that breed here, there are a sort of Flyes worthy
of a short Description; the <i>Caribbeeans</i> call them <i>Cayouyou</i>, being about the bigness
of a Beetle; they have two strong Wings, and under them thinner, which they never
spread abroad but when they flye, and then they carry such a lustre in them,
that they give as much Light in the Night as a lighted Candle, (their Eyes also
at the same time glittering like Fire) making no noise when they flye; they
feed on the Juice of Flowers, and are so smooth, that they are very apt to slip
through ones Fingers, and when they find themselves to be taken, they hide their
glittering Wings under the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Indians</i> tie these Flies to their Hands and Feet, so to have the benefit of their
Light in the Night; and anoint their Bodies all over (at certain Solemnities wherein
Candles are forbidden) with the Juice squeez’d out of them, which causes them
to shine like a Flame of Fire: They catch them with a piece of Wood which they
move in the Air, whereupon the Flyes going to sit, are taken with a Hat; but their
Light vanishes if they are kill’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>But as to what may farther be added concerning this Island, being one of the
chief of our Plantations, we cannot better satisfie the curiosity of those who desire a
true Information of all things that concern that Place, than by inserting <i>verbatim</i> a

<p class='c018'><i>I have lately seen your</i> Proposal <i>concerning an</i> English Atlas, <i>and having read Dr.</i> Heylin<i>’s
Book of the Chorography and History of the whole World, his third Edition Corrected
and Enlarged, Printed</i> Anno 1666. <i>I find him very short and erroneous in his Description of
the</i> Caribbee <i>Islands, especially of this Island of</i> Barbados, <i>wherein I have been an Inhabitant
more than eleven years. He saith</i>,</p>

<p class='c023'>1. The Island is seventeen or eighteen Miles in compass.</p>

<p class='c023'>2. On the South ’tis furnish’d with a large and commodious Harbor.</p>

<p class='c023'>3. The chief Commodities are Tobacco, and a kind of course Sugar, call’d <i>Barbados
Sugar</i>, which must be quickly spent, or ’twill melt to nothing.</p>

<p class='c023'>4. That this Island is worth all the Plantations made by the <i>English</i>, and yet that
we hold it at the Courtesie of the <i>Spaniard</i>, without whose Leave and Liking,
not of Force to hold it.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>This Description of Dr.</i> Heylin<i>’s, in it self very false, is also much to the Dishonor of the</i>
English <i>Nation, which makes me presume to trouble you with my own Observations, wherein having
onely aim’d at the Truth, you shall not have cause to doubt of being misguided</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>This Island of</i> Barbados <i>is seated in thirteen Degrees and twenty Minutes, length twenty
two Miles, and in breadth fourteen and an half; It is naturally fortifi’d with Rocks and Shoals
on the North and East side of it, where no Ship may safely Anchor, onely two or three places
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>small Boats may go out and in to Fish. On the South-East and Westerly part, it is all along a
Road when Ships may Ride at Anchor, but more especially in four chief Places, Roads and Bays
thereof.</i></p>

<p class='c018'><i>The principal Road or Bay is call’d</i> Carlisle Bay, <i>and lieth on the South-West part of the
Island near its Center, and is a good Road, where five hundred Ships of any Burthen may
Ride safely from all but South and Westerly Winds, which seldom in these Parts happen, they generally
blowing Easterly, whence it is that we call the East parts</i> Windward, <i>and the West
parts</i> Leeward. <i>Here lies also the chief Town for Trade, call’d formerly the</i> Bridge-Town,
<i>but now</i> St. Michaels, <i>and having two Forts, answering each other, and a Platform between,
which Commands the Road, and Defends the Town; the first and chiefest Fort is call’d</i> Charles
Fort, <i>standing on</i> Nedhams Point, <i>lying out in the Sea to Windward of the Bay and Town, so
that an Enemy keeping out of Command of this Fort, cannot (probably) come to do the Ships or
the Town injury, for that they must come full in or against the Wind. This Fort is built strong
with Stone and Lime; the Platform joyns to the Windward part of the Town; also the other
Fort joyns to the Leeward part of the Town, all which are well fortifi’d and stor’d with great
Guns. The Town consists of several Streets and Lanes, being about thirty Chain in length, and fifteen
in breadth, and hath many fair and large Buildings, whereof the most are of Stone and Lime.</i></p>

<p class='c018'><i>The second Road and Town is lately call’d</i> Charles-Town, <i>situate on</i> Oysters-Bay, <i>and
lies about two Leagues to Windward of</i> St. Michaels, <i>having also two Forts and one Platform;
the two Forts stand the one to Windward, and the other to Leeward of the Town and Road, and
the Platform in the middle, all well furnish’d with great Guns. And although this Town be not a
Place of much Resort for Shipping, yet here are many considerable Store-houses for Trade, wherein
Monethly are kept the Court of</i> Common-Pleas <i>for that Precinct, and Weekly Markets</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>The third Road and Town is lately call’d</i> St. James’s, <i>formerly the</i> Hall, <i>and is about two
Leagues to the Leeward of</i> St. Michaels, <i>hath one very large Platform, and is otherwise well fortifi’d
with Breast-works; and although few Ships come to Ride here, yet in this Town is maintain’d
a great Trade with the Inhabitants adjacent; here also is kept Monethly the Court of</i> Common-Pleas
<i>for this Precinct</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>The fourth Road and Town is lately call’d</i> Little Bristol, <i>but formerly</i> Sprights-Bay,
<i>which lieth about four Leagues to Leeward of</i> St. Michaels, <i>and hath two Forts well built, and
strongly fortifi’d. To this Place come many Ships, especially from the City of</i> Bristol, <i>the which
here Ride, unload and re-load, it being the next greatest Place of Repute to</i> St. Michaels <i>in the
whole Island</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>This Island is divided into eleven Parishes, and hath in it fourteen Churches and Chappels,
and being subdivided into divers Plantations, small and great, hath Sugar-works accordingly,
with fair and large Buildings made of Stone and Brick, the which generally are pleasant Habitations,
and delightfully situated, most having pleasant Prospects to the Sea and Land.</i></p>

<p class='c018'><i>The Inhabitants of this Island are</i> English, Scotch, <i>and</i> Irish, <i>and some, but very few of
the</i> Dutch <i>and</i> French <i>Nation, who formerly liv’d here a time of Servitude, and now dwell as
Free-men, some by their Trades, and others on Plantations; also some few</i> Jews <i>live here and
Trade as Merchants, they having obtain’d Licence from His Majesty so to do; besides</i> Mulatto’s
<i>and</i> Negro’s <i>which are here kept, and accounted for Slaves, the number of which some years
since, upon search, were found to be sixty thousand Persons</i>, viz. <i>forty thousand</i> Whites, <i>and
twenty thousand</i> Blacks.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>The standing</i> Militia <i>of this Island that are in readiness to meet together on all occasions, and
which at other times are often and well Disciplin’d, consist of two Regiments of Horse, and five
Regiments of Foot, wherein several Companies have near two hundred in a Company, and in some
Troops more than a hundred Horse in a Troop; by all which you may easily apprehend how little
of truth there is in that Saying</i>, That we hold this Island at the Courtesie of the Spaniards,
<i>when those few</i> English <i>in</i> Jamaica <i>give the</i> Spaniards <i>such work to defend themselves</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span><i>The Growth and Manufacture of this Island and parts adjacent, is Sugars of all sorts</i>, viz.
Muscovado, <i>Clay’d, and Refin’d</i>; (<i>I suppose I have seen here as good Sugar made as any is in
the World</i>) <i>Gingers</i>, <i>Indico</i>, <i>and Cotton-wool</i>; <i>also Tobacco</i>, <i>Logwood</i>, Fustick, <i>green and yellow,
and</i> Lignum-vitæ: <i>Of these four last heretofore much, but now no quantities to be had in this
Island, onely to the Leeward great store. The first four mention’d Commodities receive prejudice
to their Product by abundance of Rains or Droughts not happening their proper Seasons: also
violent Winds lodge the Sugar-Canes, whereby the quantity and goodness is lessned. The chief time
for Expectation is from</i> January <i>to</i> September, <i>when comes in the wet Season, that makes
the Roads not Cartable, and usually puts an end to Making and Transportation of them. We
have two Crops of Corn in a year, Planted usually when the Rains first come in, in</i> May <i>and</i>
November, <i>which is gather’d in about</i> October, <i>and in</i> March <i>and</i> April <i>following. Wines
of all sorts are here Imported, but of</i> Portuguese <i>and</i> French <i>the greatest quantities</i>, viz.
<i>of</i> Madera, <i>upwards of fifteen hundred Tun yearly; of</i> Spanish, <i>upward of two hundred Tun;
of</i> French-<i>Wines, upward of seven hundred Tun; besides Brandy and</i> English <i>Spirits; but of
these latter now no great quantities Imported or spent, by reason of the general use of the Spirit of
Sugar-Cane, call’d</i> Rum, <i>which the meaner sort, as Servants and Slaves, do not onely drink
in great abundance, but much also is hence Transported into</i> Virginia, Bermudas, <i>and</i> New-England.
<i>Here is also Imported great store of Provisions of all sorts</i>, viz. <i>Beef</i>, <i>Pork</i>,
<i>Fish</i>, &amp;c. <i>from</i> Ireland, New-England, Virginia, Bermudas, New-found Land, <i>&amp;c.</i>
<i>also Pease</i>, <i>Flour</i>, <i>Butter</i>, <i>Cheese</i>, <i>and Bisquet</i>; <i>likewise Timber</i>, <i>Boards</i>, <i>Pipe and Hogshead</i>,
<i>Staves</i>, &amp;c. <i>also</i> Negro-<i>Slaves from</i> Guinee, <i>and live Cattel, as Bulls</i>, <i>Cows</i>, Asinego’s, <i>and
Horses, from the</i> Cape de Verd <i>Island</i>, New-England; <i>and from</i> England, <i>Servants,
and all other Commodities for Plantations, and for Apparel</i>; <i>of all which great quantities are
hither brought and sold</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>The Shipping that comes to Trade to this Island belongs generally to</i> England; <i>some few
Vessels are here built, and pass to and fro to the Leeward Islands; and some belong to</i> New-England,
Bermudas, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>The number of Vessels which come hither to Trade in one year is
found upon search to be about two hundred of all sorts, (some years more, some less) as Ketches,
Sloops, Barques, &amp;c. containing in Burthen fifteen thousand and five hundred and five Tun, according
as they were here Entred, which is at the least a third part less than their true Burthen, by
reason every Ship pays one pound of Powder</i> per <i>Tun, the means ordain’d by this Country for
storing the Magazine; the greatest part of which Ships re-load with Sugars for</i> England, <i>and
many go for</i> New-England, Bermudas, Virginia, Tangier, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>not always full loaden
with this Countreys Growth. The usual Rate for Tunnage from hence to</i> London, <i>is from</i>
4 l. <i>to</i> 5 l. per <i>Tun</i>; <i>sometime when Ships are very plentiful, it is at</i> 3 l. <i>and less, and at
other times when scarce, from</i> 6 l. <i>to</i> 7 l. <i>in the late War with the</i> Dutch, <i>it was at</i> 10. 11.
<i>and</i> 12 l. per <i>Tun</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>The Government is Constituted by the Laws of</i> England, <i>and Laws not repugnant to them,
onely some particular Laws are here made, proper for this Place, by the Governor (or Deputy) and
his Council, (which usually are from seven to twelve in number) and an Assembly that consists of
twenty two Persons, chosen by the Free-holders, two out of every Parish</i>.</p>

<h4 id='c380' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. XXIV.</span><br /> St. Vincent.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation of <i>St. Vincent</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The Island of <i>St. Vincent</i>, South-West from <i>St. Lucia</i>, and having sixteen Degrees
of North-Latitude, was so call’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>, as having discover’d
it on that Saint’s Day, being the fifth of <i>April</i>: It is accounted eight
Leagues long and six broad, and rises round about with high Grounds and several
Mountains, which are seen at a great distance.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>This Island hath a very fruitful Soil, and for the bigness of it hath been long
since well peopled with <i>Caribbeeans</i> before the arrival of the <i>Spaniards</i>, possessing here
several Villages, to whom they are still sworn Enemies, but Truck’d with the
<i>Hollanders</i> for Provisions, Horns, Axes, Knives, and other Trifles. At the West and
South sides are convenient Bays to lie at Anchor and take Water in.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fruit <i>Momen</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Inhabitants highly esteem the <i>Momen</i>, growing to the bigness of an Apple-Tree;
the Fruit which it bears resembles a green Cucumber, and is of a pleasant
Juice, the Skin always green and prickly; the Seed which is in the same about the
bigness of a <i>French</i> Bean, is generally black, and streak’d with Golden-colour’d
Veins.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Granadilla</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Here is also that Plant mention’d elsewhere, by the <i>Spaniard</i> call’d <i>Granadilla</i>, by
the <i>Dutch Rhang-Apple</i>, and <i>La Fleur de la Passion</i> by the <i>French</i>; and it is so call’d, as
being fancied to represent the thorny Crown of our <i>Saviour</i>, together with the
Cross, Nails, Hammer and Pillar; the Plant runs along the Ground, unless it meet
with a Pole by which it runs up.</p>

<h4 id='c381' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. XXV.</span><br /> Bekia.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation of <i>Bekia</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Not far from <i>St. Vincent</i> lies the Island <i>Bekia</i>, which reckons twelves Leagues
in circumference, and lies at twelve Degrees and twelve Scruples of Northern
Latitude: It hath a secure Harbor against all Winds; but because
it is without fresh Water, it is onely frequented by the <i>Caribbeeans</i> that dwell on
<i>St. Vincent</i>, who come hither to Fish, and visit certain little Gardens which they have
there for their pleasure.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Soil produces store of Water-melons, whose red juicy Pulp yields, when
squeez’d, a great quantity of sweet Liquor, which is very refreshing, and good to
create an Appetite; their white Flowers, notch’d at the end of the leaves, afford a
delightful smell.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Anno 1633.</i> Captain <i>John Johnson Van Hoorn</i> putting in to <i>Bekia</i> to catch Tortoises,
found a fine Inlet on the West, and Eastward a Ridge of Rocks, Cotton growing
wild in the Fields, and upon the Shore a kind of Snails call’d <i>Burgun</i>, under whose
first Shell appear’d another of a Silver colour with black Specks.</p>

<h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. XXVI.</span><br /> Granada.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation of <i>Granada</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Granada</i>, lying at twelve Degrees and sixteen Scruples, like a Half-moon, from
the North to the South, is full of Woods. Towards the South-West runs
a fresh River into the Sea. The Shore very low affords good Anchorage
at twelve Leagues distance. The Current grows exceeding strong here, and the
Water also ebbs and flows in a few hours. <i>Dirick Simonszoon Witgeest</i> Sailing from
<i>Tabago</i>, was amaz’d to see with what force the Current drove him to <i>Granada</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>French</i> possess it.</div>

<p class='c010'>Hither <i>Du Parquet</i> at his own Charge sent three hundred Men from <i>Martinico</i>,
who scuffled with the Inhabitants six Moneths before they could possess the same in
Peace; and scarce had they obtain’d it at last, but by telling them that the <i>French</i>
Assistance would be very advantageous unto them against the <i>Arovages</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Duke <i>Seryllac</i> in <i>Paris</i> inform’d of the Fertility of this Island, bought it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>of <i>Du Parquet</i> for a considerable Sum of Money: And indeed <i>Granada</i> is none of the
meanest of the <i>Caribbees</i>, the Soil producing very good both Fruit and Timber-Trees,
amongst which is the <i>Latine</i>-Tree, of a tall Body, but ordinary thickness, and
in stead of Boughs, hang Leaves like Fans in long Stalks, which being ty’d together,
serve for Roofs of Houses.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is also the Tree <i>Cocoa</i>, which yet grows not so high here as in other parts
of the <i>West-Indies</i>.</p>

<h4 id='c382' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. XXVII.</span><br /> Tabago.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation of <i>Tabago</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The next which comes in view is <i>Tabago</i>, (so call’d, as some think, from the
quantity of that Drug there Planted) eight Leagues long and four broad,
lying in the eleventh Degree and sixteen Minutes of Northern Latitude,
and hath many high Mountains full of Wood, out of which glide eighteen Streams,
which watering the Plains fall into the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>Captain <i>Vitgeest</i> coming to an Anchor here, found a convenient Inlet on the
East, and fresh Water to fill his Casks. Half a League from the Shore rise five
Rocks, through which he Sail’d with his Ships. Within the Cliff opens a Bay, into
which runs a River well stor’d with Fish. More Westerly lies a larger Inlet,
which receives two delightful Streams. From the Western Promontory runs also a
Cliff Northward into the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Island is easily known by high Coasts which rise on the East side, and so
grows lower by degrees. It is likewise made pleasant by many Walks of Trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Sea produces abundance of those sorts of Fish which are common amongst
us, besides Tortoises, that lay their Eggs in the Sand.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cra-fish.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Cra-fish thereabouts are not much unlike Lobsters, have white and well
tasted Flesh, but hard to digest; they catch them in the Night on sandy Shelves
with lighted Torches.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Crabs.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Crabs get their Food very wonderfully here; for when they observe the
Mussles or Oysters to Gape for fresh Air, they put Stones between their Shells, so
that they not being able to shut them, they pull out the Fish with their Claws.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Woods feed an innumerable company of Beasts somewhat resembling
Hogs, (whose Navels are on their Backs) <i>Opassums</i>, <i>Javaris</i>’s, and <i>Tatows</i>, as also the
<i>Agoutys</i>’s and <i>Musk-Rats</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Agoutys.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Agoutys</i>’s are of a dark brown colour, and have little Tails, two Teeth in
their upper, and as many in their lower Jaw; they make a noise as if they spoke,
crying <i>Couye</i>; if hunted by Dogs, they run into hollow Trees, out of which they
are routed by Smoak.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Musk-Rats.</div>

<p class='c010'>The great <i>Musk-Rats</i> are as big as a Rabbet, and like them live in Holes made in
the Ground, but resemble an <i>European</i> Rat, onely their Skins are black, except one
part of their Bellies which are white; they smell so strong of Musk, that it overcomes
those that carry them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Serpents.</div>

<p class='c010'>Amongst the Brambles breed also Serpents of a green colour, two yards long,
and an Inch thick, feeding on Locusts and Birds, which they take in their Nests,
but do no hurt to Mankind.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Sassafras</i> Tree.</div>

<p class='c010'>But <i>Tobago</i> boasts chiefly of the <i>Sassafras</i>-Tree, which resembles the Pine-Tree,
hath a firm and streight Body, and on the top Boughs spread like a Crown, the
Bark of a dark colour and smooth, and smelling very sweet; the Leaves thin, notch’d,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>and of a deep Green, have also a delicate smell; the thinnest Roots appear above
the Ground, and are exceeding good to cure green Wounds, stoppings and shortness
of Breath occasion’d by Colds.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_439.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Tobacco, by the <i>Caribbeeans</i> call’d <i>Y-ouli</i>, Planted among the Fruit-Trees,
grows very plentifully here; it shoots up from a stringy Root, bitter of taste, with
a thick Stalk, which shoots out Boughs with great Leaves, woolly underneath,
and bears a kind of Violet Flower, which when dry’d, are succeeded by little Cods
full of black Seed; and to prevent the over-growing of it, they cut off the top of
the main Stalk.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Bird <i>Colibry</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Bird <i>Colibry</i>, which is exceeding beautiful, makes his Nest under the Tobacco-Leaves.</p>

<p class='c010'>A company of Townsmen of <i>Walcheren</i>, having a Grant from the <i>States</i> of the
<i>United Provinces</i>, sent a Colony to <i>Tabago</i>; but they being scarce two hundred in all,
were for the most part destroy’d by the <i>Caribbeeans</i>; the rest weak or sickly, fearing
the same Entertainment, sought to save themselves; so that the Island has not formerly
been frequented but by the <i>French</i> from <i>Martinico</i>, and <i>Guadalupe</i>, who for
some time came over onely to catch Turtles and <i>Lamantins</i> there.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Caribbeeans</i> also either in their March against, or Return from the <i>Arovages</i>,
Landed here for necessary Provisions; But of late the Lord <i>Lampsen</i> hath Setled a
Plantation in this desolate Island.</p>

<h4 id='c383' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. XXVIII.</span><br /> St. Christophers.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation of <i>St. Christophers</i> Island.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>St. Christophers</i>, a pretty distance from <i>Tobago</i>, receiv’d its Denomination from
<i>Christopher Columbus</i>, invited thereto by the shape of a great Mountain, having
as it were another lesser on one of its Shoulders, being fancy’d to represent
the Figure of the suppos’d Giant <i>Christopher</i>, who is reported to have carry’d our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span><i>Saviour</i> in the appearance of a little Child on his Shoulders through a deep Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Island lying seventeen Degrees and twenty five Minutes Northward of the
<i>Equinoctial Line</i>, hath twenty five Leagues in circumference.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Soil light and sandy, refuses not the production of divers sorts of Fruits
common amongst us.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the middle of the Island rises a high Mountain, out of which run fresh
Streams, that sometimes swell so high with sudden Rains, that they drown all the
Countrey near them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Division of the Island into several Wards.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Island being jointly the Plantation of both <i>English</i> and <i>French</i>, was divided
into four Wards, two whereof have been long since in possession of the <i>French</i>, and
the other two in possession of the <i>English</i>, strangely divided one from another; for
the <i>English</i> in one Ward cannot go to the other without troubling the <i>French</i>; and
so on the contrary: the <i>English</i> have more Rivers and People, the <i>French</i> more plain
Land, fitter for Cultivation, and Forts furnish’d with Guns and Soldiers. At the
Entrances of the Paths which lead into the several Wards stand Watch-houses,
where Sentinels, or Watch-men stand daily in their turns.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a Bay of the Sea they found a brave Salt-pit, from whence a sandy Cliff runs
so far into the Ocean, a that some have swum from the end thereof over to the
Island <i>Nevis</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>A Silver Mine hath been long since discover’d on this Island, in which the <i>English</i>
and <i>French</i> claim equal Interest, but neither Party make any benefit of it for
want of Miners.</p>

<p class='c010'>The high Mountains, the Springs of boyling sulphurous Water, and brambly
Woods, hinder all passage through the middle of the Island: The Ground runs
more and more sloaping to the Sea-side, and is divided into several High-ways,
along which stand convenient Houses, cover’d with red or glaz’d Slate, shaded
with Trees, and environ’d with pleasant Gardens, to which there is a delightful
Prospect from the Fields, of the green Tobacco-Leaves, the yellow Sugar-Canes,
Ginger, and Potato’s.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Basse-Terre</i> the chief Town belonging to the <i>French</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Besides the scatter’d Buildings, the <i>French</i> have built a compleat Town near the
convenientest Harbor of their Quarter, call’d <i>Basse-Terre</i>, where the Merchants
dwell in fair Houses built of Brick and Free-stone; whither all sorts of People
bring their Commodities, and Truck their <i>European</i> Goods for such as <i>St. Christophers</i>
produceth. All manner of Trades and Handicrafts live also in this Town,
and a Court of Judicature is kept every Week. The Church built of Free-stone, is
cover’d with the aforesaid red Slate, and was formerly Govern’d by the <i>Capuchins</i>;
but they being dismiss’d <i>Anno 1646.</i> the Government was given to the <i>Jesuits</i> and
<i>Carmelites</i>; who also built themselves other stately Edifices: but the Jesuit <i>Henrick
du Vivier</i> was the first who bore the chiefest Command over all.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Sick that have not sufficient Means to maintain them, have an Hospital appointed,
where all Necessaries are provided for them; and to which is added a
School for the bringing up of poor Children.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the Castle.</div>

<p class='c010'>But the chiefest Structure is the Castle, on the building whereof the Lord <i>Poincy</i>
spar’d no Cost; it is built half a <i>French</i> Mile from the Sea at the Foot of a high
Mountain, shadowed with great Trees. In the Way thither stand the Houses of
the prime Officers; and a long Walk of Orange and Lemmon-Trees leads to a large
Court before the Front of the Castle it self, which is built square with Bricks and
Free-stone three Stories high; and the Entrance into it is ascended by a large pair
of Stairs; near the Gate which opens to the West, stand great Stone Cisterns, into
which they receive the Water through Pipes laid under Ground; the Chambers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>and Halls are very lightsom and high, and the Walls of them adorn’d with Cedar; a flat
Terrace on the top yields a pleasant Prospect all over the Countrey; the Windows
in the Front look open not onely upon the Orange Walk, but also upon several delightful
Plantations of Sugar-Canes and Ginger.</p>

<p class='c010'>Westward appear several Mountains, whose high Heads are invested with ever-flourishing
Trees; and between the Palace and those Mountains a very large and
stately Garden, full of all manner of Flowers and other delightful Plants, as well
those commonly known amongst us, as those peculiar to that part of the World;
in the middle thereof stands a Fountain, deriving its Source from the Foot of a
neighboring Hill.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Winds which blow from the Hills, and especially those cool Blasts daily
coming out of the East, so tempers the hot Climate, that it becomes very tolerable.</p>

<p class='c010'>When any News arrives here of the <i>French</i> Conquests in <i>Europe</i>, they sound the
Trumpets on the top of the Castle, and the Standards and Ensigns formerly taken
by the Governor in the Field, are hung out of the Windows.</p>

<p class='c010'>On one side of the Castle stands a Chappel, and somewhat farther on a rising
Plain, a row of Houses, inhabited by certain Retainers to the Governor, and is call’d
<i>Angola</i>. The Offices and Lodgings for the Governor’s Servants are built of Brick,
about the Castle, which is fortifi’d with five Sconces, whereon are planted several
Guns.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Governor keeps nine hundred Slaves, and a hundred <i>French</i>-men, to work
in his three Sugar-Mills, to till his Ground, and for his Houshold-Service.</p>

<p class='c010'>Several <i>French</i> Gentlemen have also built many fair Houses here; amongst which
the chiefest are those on which <i>Poucy</i>, <i>Treval</i>, <i>Benevent</i>, <i>Girand</i>, <i>Auber</i>, <i>de la Roziere</i>,
<i>de St. Andant</i>, <i>de l’ Esperance</i>, and <i>de la Loche</i> spent great sums of Money.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>English</i> also are not much inferior to them in their Counties.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>English</i> Plantations in this Island.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Churches are five in all; first on the Point of the <i>Palm-Tree</i> stands a fair
Church; a second near the great Road, below the <i>English</i> Governor’s House; a third
at the <i>Sandy Point</i>; which are all well built, and large enough for a considerable
Congregation; the other two at the Inlet <i>Cayoune</i> are short of the three first. The
Ministers thereof receiv’d formerly their Benefices from the Bishop of <i>Canterbury</i>,
in <i>Cromwell</i>’s time from the <i>Tryers</i>, as they were call’d; but of late, since the King’s
Restauration, from the Bishop of <i>Canterbury</i> again.</p>

<p class='c010'>The best Houses belonging to the <i>English</i> were built by Mr. <i>Warner</i>, Mr. <i>Rich</i>,
Mr. <i>Evrard</i>, and Col. <i>Geffreyson</i> all successively Governors of the Place.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their success at their first Landing.</div>

<p class='c010'>It was in the Year 1625. that the <i>English</i> and <i>French</i> jointly (<i>Desnambuc</i> Commanding
the <i>French</i>, and <i>Thomas Warner</i> the <i>English</i>) Landed on this Island of <i>St. Christophers</i>,
at a certain time when the <i>Caribbeeans</i>, perswaded by their <i>Boyez</i> to destroy all
Strangers, were ready up in Arms, but they met with such Entertainment, that
they soon lost their Courage, and yielded possession to the Assailants: Not long after
which <i>Desnambuc</i> and <i>Warner</i> went (the one to <i>Paris</i>, and the other to <i>London</i>) to
inform their Kings of the Condition of <i>St. Christophers</i>, and to raise a Company
which might promote the Planting of it: Both attain’d their Desires, and had fresh
Assistance given them; for both Kings favor’d the Design, in regard of the good
Conditions that were propos’d to those that should go Undertakers thither: And
to prevent all Contentions between the <i>English</i> and <i>French</i>, they made Boundaries on
each side; but Hunting, Harbors, Fishing, Mines, Trees for Wainscoting, and the
like, were to remain in common; and each was to assist the other. The <i>English</i>
Plantation increased daily more than the <i>French</i>; having constant Supplies from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>Company in <i>London</i>; when as on the contrary, the Merchants at <i>Paris</i> grew weary,
being desirous first to have a Return for what they had already spent, though the
Countrey was not yet Manur’d: wherefore <i>Desnambuc</i> going thither himself, made
the Company understand that they could not possibly expect to receive a Return,
unless the Countrey were Planted with Tobacco, Indigo, Ginger, and Sugar,
which requir’d both Time and People. But whilst the Business seem’d to go on
prosperously, a great Accident hapned which threw down the Work to nothing:
for the <i>Spanish</i> King set out a Fleet within the fore-mention’d Year, of one and
thirty Gallions, three Galeasses, and four Pinnaces, with seventy five hundred Men,
under the Command of <i>Frederick de Toledo</i>, <i>Emanuel de Mineses</i>, and <i>John Fajardo</i>, from
<i>Cadiz</i>, when before the Island <i>St. Jago</i> there lay at the same time twenty two <i>Portuguese</i>
Galleys, fourteen Carvils, carrying four thousand Men, Commanded by <i>Antonio
Nunnez Barreio</i>, and <i>Francisco de Almeida</i>, who joyning with the <i>Spaniards</i>, took
the City <i>St. Salvador</i>, and went about wholly to chase out of the <i>Caribbee</i> Isles all
the <i>English</i> and <i>French</i>: in which Attempt nine <i>English</i> Ships lying before <i>Nevis</i>,
were all taken by <i>Toledo</i>, who Sail’d within Cannon-shot of <i>St. Christophers</i>, Commanded
at that time by the <i>French</i> Captain <i>Rossey</i>, the Forts cast up by the <i>English</i>
and <i>French</i> not being stor’d with Provisions nor Ammunition, and consequently no
way able to endure a Siege, and the less, because the Works were not quite finish’d;
nevertheless <i>Desnambuc</i> immediately drew up his Soldiers to the Low-land, where
he lay Intrench’d along the Coast, to prevent the Enemies Landing; but <i>Rossey</i>
suffer’d the <i>Spaniards</i> to Land without the least Resistance: whereupon young <i>Du
Parquet</i> Sallying out of the Sconces, fell valiantly upon the first Company, but being
forsaken by his Men, was run down by the Multitude and kill’d: In the mean
time all their Sloops full of Men Landed, insomuch that <i>Rossey</i> fearing to be surrounded,
left his Trench and went up into the High-lands, whereby the <i>Spaniards</i>
became Masters of the Fort, but did not pursue their Victory, as suspecting that the
<i>French</i> might lie in Ambuscade in the next Wood; and indeed they suspected not in
vain, for the <i>French</i> having undermin’d their Forts, had laid Gun-powder in some
of the Cellars, which firing, blew up very many of the <i>Spaniards</i>, whilst <i>Desnambuc</i>
Embarquing himself, sav’d those which were not slain by the Enemy’s Sword.
Mean while the <i>English</i> relying on the League between the King of <i>England</i> and the
<i>Spaniard</i>, made no Resistance, (notwithstanding they were inform’d that <i>Frederick
Toledo</i> had quite ruin’d the <i>French</i> Plantation, and put them all to the Sword) but
sent Agents to <i>Toledo</i>, to put him in mind of the League between <i>Spain</i> and <i>England</i>,
which he not taking notice of, alledg’d, That Pope <i>Alexander</i> the Sixth, when a
Controversie arose concerning the new Discoveries in the East and West, between
the Crowns of <i>Castile</i> and <i>Portugal</i>, had determin’d that <i>Castile</i> had sole Right to the
Western World, and therefore that <i>St. Christophers</i>, being a part of the Western
World, according to the <i>Pope</i>’s Gift, belong’d to his Master <i>Philip</i>; and insisting upon
that Allegation, he commanded them to quit their Right to the Place; to which
purpose he restor’d them six of the nine Ships taken at <i>Nevis</i>, on Condition that
they should immediately set Sail for <i>England</i>, onely those whom the six Vessels were
not able to carry, were permitted to stay on the Island till the next opportunity:
After which <i>Toledo</i> weighing Anchor, was scarce out of sight, when the <i>English</i> began
to take new Courage, and gathering together to repair their ruin’d Works as well as
possibly they could with what Forces they had left; for besides those who went for
<i>England</i> in the six Ships, being near two thousand, the <i>Spanish</i> Admiral took six hundred
choice <i>English</i>, which he distributed amongst his Fleet; whilest <i>Desambuc</i> suffer’d
a great deal of hardship, not onely through ill Weather at Sea, but also for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>want of Provisions; Having during this time been on the Islands <i>St. Martin</i>, <i>Montserrat</i>,
and <i>Antego</i>, thinking to have possess’d himself of some or other of them in
stead of <i>St. Christophers</i>, but not finding such a fruitful Soil, and convenient Situation,
as what he had been forc’d to forsake, he was not forward to fix there, but rather
judg’d it convenient to enquire concerning the Condition of <i>St. Christophers</i>,
and at last being inform’d by a Ketch, that the Enemy was gone to <i>Havana</i>, and the
<i>English</i> were busie in Tilling their Lands, he return’d to his old Station; where nevertheless
their Endeavors to repair what was ruin’d, had been in vain, by reason
of the scarcity of Provisions, and want of other Necessaries, had not in their greatest
extremity some <i>Netherland</i> Vessels arriving there, furnish’d them with Provisions,
Clothes, and other Necessaries, on bare promises of payment: But not long after
growing rich with Tobacco, Sugars, Ginger, and Indigo, they made Satisfaction
to all their Creditors, and at last attain’d to the Condition before mention’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the late War between Us and the <i>Dutch</i>, the <i>French</i> taking advantage of our
Engagement, endeavor’d to destroy our Plantations there, and to make themselves
Masters of the whole Island; but the Matter being at last brought to some Agreement,
Sir <i>Charles Wheeler</i> hath been very lately sent over thither by His Majesty to
re-settle Affairs there, and order the Capitulations between the <i>French</i> and <i>English</i>.</p>

<h3 id='c387' class='c001'>CHAP. XIX.<br /> The Islands Sotavento, and the Isle Trinidado.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>In the Division we found to be made of the Islands that lie between <i>Florida</i> and
<i>New Spain</i>, and <i>Southern America</i>, the last are the Isles of <i>Sotavento</i>, which are
reckon’d to be these three, <i>Margareta</i>, <i>Cubagua</i>, and <i>Tabago</i>, but the last is by
most accounted, and hath been mention’d amongst the <i>Caribbees</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Situation of <i>Margareta</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Margareta</i>, so call’d from the abundance of Pearls (of which the <i>Spanish</i> Appellation
comes near the Latine <i>Margaritæ</i>) found there by the <i>Spaniards</i> at their first
Discovery, lies about the twelfth Degree of Northern Latitude over against the
Main Land of <i>Cumana</i>, from which it is distant about seven Leagues: It is accounted
sixteen Leagues long, and half as much in breadth, and was discover’d by
<i>Columbus</i> in his third Voyage in the Year of our Lord 1498. and was at first in great
reputation, in regard of the rich Pearl-fishing upon its Coasts, wherein the <i>Spaniards</i>
(more favorable it seems to the Natives of this Place than usual, because of their
readiness to discover their Treasures) employ’d <i>Negro</i>’s, brought from the Coast of
<i>Guinee</i>, whom by severe Punishments inflicted, they forc’d to such excessive Labor,
that many of them, though excellent Divers, were drown’d, others either devour’d,
or lam’d by the ravenous great Fish thereabouts, and by destroying the very Seed
through their insatiable greediness after Pearl, brought the Trade of Pearl-fishing in
a short time to a very small Account, in respect of what it might have been, had it
been well husbanded. Nor hath this Island of late Years been much frequented, only
in the Year 1601. Captain <i>Parker</i> with a Fleet of <i>English</i> put on Shore here, and
took as many Prisoners as he had five hundred pounds of Pearl for the Ransom of,
and at his coming away took a Ship he met from off the Coast of <i>Angola</i>, with three
hundred and seventy <i>Negro</i>’s aboard her, who were going to be sold for Slaves.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Soil is not unfruitful, bringing forth several sorts of Fruit, and store of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span><i>Maiz</i>, and probably if improv’d, would as well bear Wheat, and other usual kinds
of Grain; but there is great want of Water, which the Inhabitants are troubled to
fetch from the neighboring Continent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and Places of chief note.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Places of chief note, are 1. <i>Monpater</i>, a Fort built by the <i>Spaniards</i> in a Nook
of the Island, lying Eastward to secure the Pearl-fishing Trade, and to defend the
Town where the Governor resides, as also the Treasurer of the King of <i>Spain</i>’s Customs
of Pearl, which have been formerly valu’d at 50000 <i>l.</i> yearly.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>El valle de Santa Lucia</i>, two Leagues from this Town, and as much from the
Sea, a <i>Spanish</i> Colony.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>Macanao</i>, the onely noted Place belonging to the Natives.</p>

<h4 id='c388' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. II.</span><br /> Cubagua.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation of <i>Cubagua</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Cubagua</i> lies South-West of <i>Margarita</i>, about the eleventh Degree of North-Latitude,
a League or thereabouts distant from <i>Margarita</i>, and six Leagues
from the nearest Continent, and about three Leagues in circumference.
This is also a very great Place for Pearl-fishing, the benefit whereof hath been so
considerable, that the King of <i>Spain</i>’s Fifths are said to have amounted some years
to fifteen thousand <i>Ducats</i>; but otherwise of a poor and barren Soil, not onely destitute
of Water, but of Fruit, Grain, Herbage, and all manner of Cattel and eatable
Beasts, except a few lean Coneys; nevertheless, in respect of the Pearl-fishing
Trade, the <i>Spaniards</i> have Planted here a Colony, which they call’d <i>New Cadiz</i>, having
plenty of Provisions brought them from the adjoining Coasts, and soon after
their first Planting grew in a short time so powerful, that they became Masters of
one of the best Ports of those Seas, call’d <i>Maracapana Venezuela</i>; but upon an Alarm
of the Salvages of <i>Cumana</i>, for a while deserted the Island, and betook themselves to
<i>Hispaniola</i>; from whence nevertheless being remanded back with fresh Supplies,
under the Command of <i>James de Castellon</i>, they soon re-instated themselves in their
former Plantation, and made it more strong and flourishing than before; in which
state they remain’d as long as the Pearl-fishing Trade continu’d, but that decaying,
the splendor also of this Colony declin’d: so that at present the onely thing which
makes the Place remarkable, is a Fountain on the East part of the Island, not far
from the Sea, yielding a liquid bituminous Water, of singular use in Medicine, and
sometimes found floating on the Sea at two or three Leagues distance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Island <i>Coche</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>About four Leagues distant from <i>Cubagua</i> there is an Island call’d <i>Coche</i>, about
three Miles in compass; It was discover’d in the Year 1529. and was formerly little
less considerable for Pearl-fishing than the other two.</p>

<h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. III.</span><br /> Trinidado.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation of <i>Trinidado</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The Island of <i>Trinidado</i> was first discover’d by <i>Columbus</i>, <i>Anno 1447.</i> in his
third Voyage, and by him so call’d, as some guess, from its three Points or
Promontories; but that seems not so probable, in regard it is otherwise
call’d <i>La Trinidad</i>, or <i>Insula Sanctæ Trinitatis</i>, and therefore is likely to have been denominated
upon a religious Account: It lieth nine Degrees or thereabouts distant
from the <i>Line</i>, at the Mouth of the River <i>Orenoque</i>, and is separated from the Coast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>of <i>Paria</i>, over against which it lies by a <i>Straight</i> that is three Miles over, and which
for the dangerousness of passing it, <i>Columbus</i>, the first Discoverer of it, call’d <i>Bocca
del Draco</i>; the length thereof from the most Southern Angle call’d <i>Punta del Andrada</i>,
to the North-East, call’d <i>Punta del Galera</i>, is reckon’d twenty five Leagues, (those
that reckon fifty, may be suppos’d to mistake Leagues for Miles) and the breadth
about eighteen.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chief Commodities of the Island.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Air of this Place is so impure, that it is accounted the unwholsomest Island
of all the <i>Indies</i>; nevertheless the Soil is not unfertile, as bringing forth Sugar-Canes,
Cotton, <i>Maize</i>, Tobacco of the best kind, with other Commodities of the general
growth of the <i>West-Indies</i>, besides store of good Fruit and Cattel; and one part of
the Island call’d <i>Terra de Bea</i>, produceth great plenty of Pitch, but not of the best
kind; and there have been discover’d several Veins of Gold and other Metals.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Natives, some say, were antiently call’d <i>Cairi</i>, or <i>Carai</i>, and were distinguish’d
into several <i>Clans</i> or Tribes, each under the Government of a <i>Casique</i>, or petty
Prince; but most of them dreading the <i>Spaniards</i> Cruelty, deserted the Island, and
Setled themselves in <i>Guiana</i>; and at present both this Place, <i>Guiana</i>, and <i>El Dorado</i>,
have of Custom one and the same Governor, whose Place of Residence here is
<i>St. Josephs</i>, the chief, if not onely Town of the Island; it stands Southward upon
the <i>Carone</i>. Here most of that Tobacco is made, which is sold amongst us for
<i>Spanish</i>. In the Year 1595. Sir <i>Walter Raleigh</i> possess’d himself of it, being then but
a petty Village of about forty Houses, and took Prisoner the then Governor <i>Antonio
Berreo</i>, who, in all probability, to ingratiate himself with him, gave him some light
towards the discovery of <i>Guiana</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Tabago.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>On the North-East of <i>Trinidado</i>, and not above eight Miles distant from it, lies
the Island of <i>Tabago</i>, which hath been already treated of, as one of the <i>Caribbees</i>,
though some will have it one of the <i>Sotavento</i>; it is otherwise call’d <i>New Walcheren</i>,
from a Town of that Name in <i>Zealand</i>, from whence a Colony of <i>Netherlanders</i>
was sent to Plant it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Virgin Gorda.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Amongst others of the small obscure Islands hereabouts, is <i>Virgin Gorda</i>, which is
sometimes reckon’d amongst the <i>Caribbee</i> Islands; but since there is nothing considerable
to be spoken of it, it is sufficient that it hath been mention’d, though not
punctually in its proper place.</p>

<h3 id='c389' class='c001'>CHAP. XX.<br /> California.</h3>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><i>California</i> how distinguish’d.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Having before made mention of <i>California</i>, as it is by some taken for that
large portion of <i>Northern America</i> which lies most Southward, and also utmost
West of all that is known of the <i>New World</i>, and having treated of
those several Provinces which are generally reckon’d to be comprehended in it,
(excepting <i>California</i> strictly taken, as it is generally granted to be an Island) <i>viz.</i>
<i>Quivira</i>, <i>Cibola</i>, and <i>Nova Albion</i>, lying on the Continent (though there want not those
who make <i>Nova Albion</i> onely the North part of <i>California</i>) we shall close up our
Discourse of these Islands that lie Northward of the <i>Equinoctial Line</i> with the aforesaid
<i>California</i>, specially so call’d, which was by many thought and describ’d to be
but a <i>Peninsula</i>, or half Island, by reason that the Bay which divides it from <i>Quivira</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>and <i>New Gallicia</i>, towards the North runneth much narrower than it doth Southerly,
which made them think, that somewhere or other at the North it was joyn’d
to the Main Land of <i>America</i>; But later Discoveries, as hath been said, have found
it to be a perfect Island, and altogether separate from the Continent: for about
the Year 1620. some Adventurers beating upon those Coasts Northward, accidentally,
and before they were aware, fell upon a <i>Straight</i>, the Waters whereof ran with
such a Torrent and violent Course, that they brought them into <i>Mar Vermiglio</i>,
whether they would or no, and before they knew it, and by that means discover’d
that <i>California</i> was an Island, and that the Waters which were observ’d to fall so
violently into that Sea towards the North, were not the Waters of any River emptying
it self into the Bay from the Main Land, as was formerly thought, but the
Waters of the North-West Sea it self, violently breaking into the Bay, and dividing
it wholly from the Continent: It lieth North and South, extending it self in a
vast length, full twenty Degrees of Latitude, <i>viz.</i> from twenty two to forty two;
but the breadth nothing answerable: The most Northern Point of it is call’d <i>Cape
Blanche</i>; that to the South, <i>Cape St. Lucas</i>, memorable for that rich and gallant Prize
which Captain <i>Cavendish</i>, in the Year 1587. being then in his Voyage about the
World, took from the <i>Spaniards</i> near to this Place. As for the Island it self, it is at
present little, if at all inhabited by the <i>Spaniards</i>; whether it be that they want Men
to furnish new Plantations, or that they find no matter of invitation and encouragement
from the Countrey, or perhaps that the access thither be not so easie: for
’tis reported to be wonderfully well peopled by the Natives, and that there were
found onely upon the Coasts and along the Shore of <i>Mar Vermiglio</i>, twenty or twenty
three Nations, all of different Languages; though from the particular Narrations
that have been made of the Voyages of several eminent Persons into these Parts,
it appears that the <i>Spaniards</i> have taken great pains in the discovery thereof, and also
from the several <i>Spanish</i> Names of Places, that they have had Plantations here formerly,
however neglected at present.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Customs and Manners of the Natives.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey is abundantly well stor’d with Fish and Fowl, as appears partly
by the Natives, who take a huge pride in making themselves gay with the Bones
of the one, with which they load their Ears, and sometimes their Noses also; and
with the Feathers of the other, which ordinary People wear onely sticking about
their Wastes; but Great Persons, and such as will be fine indeed, beset their Heads
strangely with them, and have commonly one Bunch of them bigger than ordinary
hanging down behind them like a Tail.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having no knowledge of the true God, they worship what the Devil will have
them, that is, the Sun, attributing to it onely the increase of their Plants, healthful
Seasons, and most of the other good things they enjoy, or are sensible of.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Government.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Government is said to be onely <i>Oeconomical</i>, each Father ordering the Affairs
of his Family apart, without subjection to any other Superior; yet so well
manag’d, that they live in good Peace one with another; not without many good
Laws and Customs, <i>viz.</i> That they allow but one Wife to one Man; That they
punish Adultery with Death; That they suffer not Maids to talk or converse with
Men till they be Married; That Widows may not Marry till they have Mourn’d
at least one half year for their Husbands deceased; and divers others of like
nature, which perhaps, if the truth were known, do more properly belong to the
Natives of <i>Utopia</i>, or <i>New Atlantis</i>, than to these of <i>California</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Places of note.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Places therein, as yet observ’d, are onely upon the Sea-coasts, 1. The <i>Capes</i>
of <i>St. Clara</i> and <i>St. Lucas</i>, the one at the South-East end of the Island, looking towards
<i>New Gallicia</i>, the other at the South-West, looking into the Sea, and towards <i>Asia</i>.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>
<img src='images/i_447.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>St. Cruce</i>, so nam’d from its being first discover’d on <i>Holy-Rood</i>-Day, being a
large and convenient Haven, not far from <i>Cape St. Clara</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>Cabo de las Playas</i>, so call’d from a company of little bare Hillocks appearing
from the Sea, and is more within the Bay.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>Cabo Baxo</i>, so term’d, as lying towards the bottom of the Gulf.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <i>St. Andrews</i>, another convenient Haven upon an Island of the same Name.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <i>St. Thomas</i>, an Island at the Mouth of the Gulf or Bay, of about twenty
five Leagues in compass, rising Southerly with an high mountainous Point, under
which is a convenient Road for Shipping, and twenty five Fathoms of Water.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the other side of the Island, towards the Main Sea, there is 1. <i>St. Abad</i>, a good
Haven, and almost surrounded with a pleasant and fruitful Countrey.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Cape Trinidado</i>, a noted Promontory.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>Cape de Cedras</i>, so call’d (together with a small Island near it) from the store of
Cedars growing thereabouts.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>Enganno.</i> 5. <i>Puebla de las Canoas</i>, so nam’d from the abundance of those little
Boats which the <i>Americans</i> generally use, and do call <i>Canoos</i>, whereof perhaps
some store are made there.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <i>Cabo de Galera</i>, from its resemblance to a Rat.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is believ’d there are many more Promontories and Bays on both sides of this
Island, besides Rivers and Islets, yet not nam’d, and altogether unknown. Moreover
Dr. <i>Heylin</i> hath well observ’d, that those above-mention’d are the Names onely
of Places, and not of Towns and Villages, though doubtless there must needs have
been some scatter’d Houses, built formerly by the <i>Spaniards</i> in so many Expeditions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cortez</i> the first Discoverer of these Parts.</div>

<p class='c010'>The first Discoverer of these Parts was <i>Ferdinando Cortez</i>, who having in the Year
1534. set out two Ships to that purpose from <i>St. Jago</i>, a Haven of <i>New Spain</i>, and
not finding the Success answerable to his Expectation, went next Year himself in
Person, and pass’d a good way up the Gulf, but for want of Provisions was forc’d
to return without having done any thing to the purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1539. one <i>Francisco</i>, a Companion of <i>Cortez</i> in the former Expedition, Set out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>upon his own Charges, and having Coasted all about, both upon the Eastern and
Western Shores, he at last Landed, but not without notable opposition from the
Natives, who with much clamour, and many antique Gestures set upon his Men so
furiously with Stones and Arrows, that they had met with a shrew’d Repulse, had
it not been for the Valor of their Auxiliaries, the Mastiff Dogs, which it seems they
us’d to carry along with them in those kind of Voyages; but at last he got footing
so far, that he took possession in the Name of the King of <i>Spain</i> with the usual Formalities;
and following the Example of <i>Columbus</i> set up a Cross in the Place for a
Memorial and Testimony of his having been there.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Marco de Nisa</i> his Relation of these Parts.</div>

<p class='c010'>Much about the same time <i>Marco de Nisa</i> a <i>Franciscan</i>, undertaking a Voyage into
these Parts, reported Wonders at his Return, of the plenty of golden Mines,
stately Cities, set out with magnificent Buildings, the very Gates whereof were
enrich’d with <i>Turquoises</i>, and other Precious Stones, and whose meanest Inhabitants
went glittering in Gold and Mother of Pearl, and of the flourishing Condition of
the Kingdoms of <i>Acu</i>, <i>Tonteac</i>, and <i>Marata</i>; whereupon the Governor of <i>New Gallicia</i>
was sent by the then Vice-Roy of <i>Mexico</i>, with great hopes of bringing back a Confirmation of
these Reports; but whether out of spite to be deceiv’d in his Expectation,
or having real cause so to do, he represented all things as mean and despicable,
as the Fryer had proclaim’d them rich and glorious.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>De Alarcon</i> his Voyage.</div>

<p class='c010'>The next that went upon this Design was <i>Ferdinando de Alarcon</i>, who is reported
to have Sail’d many Leagues up a River call’d <i>Buena Guia</i>, and there to have receiv’d
Homage of <i>Naguacatus</i>, one of the Heads of the <i>Californian</i> Tribes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cabrillo</i> his Expedition.</div>

<p class='c010'>One more Attempt was made in the Year 1642. by <i>Roderico Cabrillo</i>, who discover’d
the Island of <i>St. Luke</i>, and another call’d <i>The Island of Possession</i>; and this was
the last we hear of that thought it worth while to go an Undertaker to these
Coasts, and ever since all Undertakings hither have been so wholly laid aside, that
what-ever was once discover’d in these Parts, seems rather to be lost and forgotten,
than any way improv’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>As for <i>Nova Albion</i>, whereas many determine it to be onely the utmost Northern
part of <i>California</i>, though it doth not absolutely appear to be so from the Relation
of Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>’s Discovery of it, we judge it agreeable to Method and Decorum
not wholly to omit the mention of it in this place, though it hath been already
spoken of, and the aforesaid Relation deliver’d at large amongst the rest of those
Provinces of largely-taken <i>California</i>, which were taken for granted to be upon the
Continent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Drakes</i> Account of the Countrey.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Drake</i> and his Company brought home this Description of the Countrey and its
Inhabitants, <i>viz.</i> <i>That the Countrey was exceedingly well stor’d with Deer, Grazing up and
down the Hills by thousands in a company; That the Men generally went naked all over, the
Women using onely a piece of a Mat, or some such thing instead an Apron; That their Houses
were built onely of Turf and Osier, yet so wrought together, that they serv’d very well to
keep out the Cold; in the midst of it was their Hearth where they made their Fire, and lay all
round about it together upon several Beds of Bull-Rushes. What their Towns Were, or whither
they had any, is altogether unknown</i>.</p>

Having compleated our Description of <i>Mexicana</i>, or <i>Northern
America</i>, being that great <i>Peninsula</i> which lies Northward
of the <i>Isthmus</i>, or <i>Straight</i> of <i>Darien</i>, together with all
the Islands on the North side of the <i>Equinoctial Line</i>, we
come now to the Southern Part, otherwise call’d <i>Peruana</i>,
from <i>Peru</i> the chief Kingdom thereof, being the other
great <i>Peninsula</i>, which lies Southward of the aforesaid
<i>Straight</i>: It is generally resembled to the form of a Pyramid
revers’d; the Basis whereof, that is to say, the more Southerly parts of it towards
<i>Magellanica</i> and the <i>Straights</i>, extend themselves largely both East and West,
becoming more sharp and streight towards the North, and those parts by which it
is joyn’d to <i>Mexicana</i>: in the whole it is suppos’d to contain a Circuit of seventeen
thousand Miles at least, and is water’d with four of the greatest Rivers of the
World, besides abundance of lesser Streams, which issuing from the <i>Andes</i> and other
Mountains of the Countrey, do run from all Parts both into the North and South
Sea, much fertilizing the Countreys through which they pass; the four principal
are these following:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The chief Rivers thereof.</div>

<p class='c010'>1. <i>Orellana</i>, so call’d from the first Discovery thereof by <i>Franciscus de Orellana</i>,
otherwise the River of <i>Amazons</i>, from a Generation of warlike Women, who (as the
Tradition goes) inhabited certain Countreys lying upon the Banks thereof. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>riseth in the Province of <i>Peru</i>, and runneth a Course of little less than five thousand
Miles, discharging it self at last into the North Sea, through a Channel, as some
say, of threescore Leagues broad, and yet with such a violent Current or Stream,
that it is said to keep its natural colour and taste almost thirty Miles in the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Orenoque</i>, by some call’d <i>Raliana</i>, from Sir <i>Walter Raleigh</i>, who endeavor’d to
discover it, a River of the Province of <i>Guiana</i>, whose Head or Spring is not yet discover’d:
It is said to be Navigable a thousand Miles together by the tallest Ships,
and no less than two thousand by Pinnaces and smaller Vessels, and dischargeth it self
likewise into the North Sea by sixteen several Channels or Mouths, making thereby
several Islands; some whereof are said to be of good bigness, and to lie at a distance
of a hundred Miles or more one from the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>Maragnon</i>, a River of a yet larger Course than any of the former, being, as
’tis said, no less than six thousand Miles from its Head, which is out of the <i>Andes</i> in
<i>Peru</i>, to its Fall, which is likewise into the North Sea about <i>Cape Blanco</i>, by a Channel
of seventy Leagues in breadth.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>Rio de la Plata</i>, otherwise call’d <i>Paraguay</i>, a River of two thousand Miles
Course, and falling as the rest into the North Sea, by a Channel of threescore
Miles over, and about thirty Degrees Southward of the <i>Line</i>, towards the <i>Straights</i>
of <i>Magellane</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Mountains <i>Andes</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Andes</i>, or Mountains before mention’d being the most noted, and biggest
of all <i>America</i>, and indeed of the whole World, and thought by <i>Cortesius</i> to be the
same with <i>Sephar</i>, spoken of in the tenth Chapter of <i>Genesis</i>, run above a thousand
Leagues in length from <i>Timama</i>, a Town of <i>New Granada</i> in the Province of <i>Popayan</i>,
and are in the narrowest place about twenty Leagues broad; and also of
equal heighth with, if not higher than <i>Caucasus</i> it self: the Ascent to them is unpassable,
except in very few places, by reason of craggy Precipices, and wild overgrown
pathless Woods, serving onely for a shelter to Serpents and other poysonous
Animals, which are there so numerous, that a whole Army of one of the Kings of
<i>Peru</i> is reported to have been destroy’d by them; and what-ever People there are
inhabiting in any of these Woods and Fastnesses, must needs be in the very utmost
degree of rude and brutish salvageness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some divide <i>Southern America</i> into <i>Peruviana</i> and <i>Brasiliana</i>: <i>Peruviana</i> they subdivide
into <i>Terra Firma</i> and <i>Peru</i>; <i>Brasiliana</i> into <i>Brasile</i> and <i>Paraguay</i>: But the most
receiv’d and commodious Division is into these particular Provinces following, all
of them wealthy and large, <i>viz.</i> 1. <i>Castella Aurea</i>, or <i>Golden Castile</i>, 2. <i>Nova Granada</i>,
or <i>The New Kingdom</i>, as they call it. 3. <i>Peru</i>, specially so call’d. 4. <i>Chile.</i> 5. <i>Paraguay.</i>
6. <i>Brasile.</i> 7. <i>Guiana.</i> 8. Lastly <i>Paria</i>, with some lesser Islands adjoyning to
all or most of these Provinces, and commonly reckon’d as part of them.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Description of <i>Castella Aurea</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Castella de Oro</i>, as the <i>Spaniards</i> call it, or <i>Golden Castile</i>, taketh up all the rest
of the <i>Isthmus</i>, or <i>Straight</i> of <i>Darien</i>, which hath not been yet spoken of, being
bounded Eastward, and to the North-East, with the <i>Atlantick</i> Ocean; and
on the West with <i>Mare del Zur</i>, and some part of <i>Veragua</i>; Southward it hath the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>new Kingdom of <i>Granada</i>. It is call’d sometimes <i>Terra Firma</i>, because it was one
of the first parts of firm Land which the <i>Spaniards</i> touch’d upon, after they had
pass’d so many Islands, as seem’d for some time to block up, and bar them from
the Continent of <i>America</i>: It is subdivided into these inferior Provinces or Countreys,
<i>viz.</i> 1. <i>Panama.</i> 2. <i>Darien.</i> 3. <i>Nova Andaluzia.</i> 4. <i>St. Martha.</i> 5. Lastly, the
little Province <i>De la Hacha</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rivers.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chief Rivers of the Province of <i>Panama</i> are 1: <i>Chagre</i>, as it was antiently call’d,
but afterwards from the great number of Crocodiles that harbor in it, <i>Rio de Lagartos</i>,
falling into the North Sea between <i>Nombre de Dios</i> and <i>Porto Bellano</i>. 2. <i>Sardinilla.</i>
3. <i>Sardina.</i> 4. <i>Rio de Colubros</i>, so call’d from the abundance of Snakes
breeding thereabouts. 5. <i>Rio de Comagre</i>, which falls into the same Sea. 6. <i>Chepo</i>,
famous in times past for its Gold-Sands. 7. <i>Rio de Balsas</i>, whose Banks are shaded
with good Timber-Trees. 8. <i>Rio de Congo</i>, which falls into <i>St. Michaels</i> Bay.</p>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Description of <i>Panama</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Panama</i>, commonly call’d <i>The District</i>, or <i>Circle of Panama</i>, is bounded Eastward
with the <i>Gulf</i>, or <i>Bay</i> of <i>Urraba</i>, by which it is separated from the rest of the
Continent of this Southern part of <i>America</i>; on the West it hath <i>Veragua</i>, one
of the Provinces of <i>Guatimala</i>; being on both the other sides wash’d with the Sea:
It is suppos’d to contain in length from <i>Carthagena</i> and <i>Popayan</i>, to the Confines of
<i>Veragua</i>, about eighty or ninety Leagues, in breadth not above threescore in any
part; and where it is narrowest, <i>viz.</i> betwixt the City of <i>Panama</i> and <i>Nombre de
Dios</i>, if measur’d by a right Line, not above six or seven over from Sea to Sea. It
lieth almost under the <i>Equinoctial Line</i>, but a few Degrees Northward of it, and
therefore somewhat hot, and by the neighborhood of both Seas subject to a foggy
and gross Air, in comparison of some other parts; so that it is not counted generally
so healthful a Countrey, especially for Strangers, and in Summer-time.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The antient Division of <i>Panama</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The antient Division of <i>Panama</i>, according to the Lordships of the <i>Casiques</i> that
then Govern’d, were these following: <i>Careta</i>, <i>Aila</i>, <i>Comagre</i>, <i>Chiam</i>, <i>Coyba</i>, <i>Chame</i>,
<i>Chiru</i>, <i>Nata</i>, <i>Tobre</i>, <i>Trota</i>, <i>Haylia</i>, <i>Burica</i>, and <i>Escotia</i>, where the South Sea with the
Spring-Tides flowing over the Plains, at its return being hardned by the Sea, is
turn’d into Salt; but as it hath always hapned in all other Countreys of the World,
that with the alteration of Government, the Division of the Countrey, and the
Names of Places have totally chang’d, so also here the antient Division of Regions
and Territories must give place to the Modern.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Nature and Customs of the antient Inhabitants.</div>

<p class='c010'>The antient Inhabitants of these Parts were a very warlike People, the Women
always accompanying their Husbands in the Wars. They us’d to hang on the tops
of their Standards the Bones of their greatest Heroes, thereby to animate their Soldiers.
Their Arms consisted of poysonous Arrows, Stone Swords, and Pikes made
of the Palm-Trees. They also carried with them the Idol <i>Chiapa</i>, to whom they
Offer’d living Children at the beginning of their Wars, and afterwards making
Merry with the Flesh, anointed the Image with the Blood: Moreover, if they return’d
home Conquerors, they spent several days in all manner of Debaucheries, as
Drinking, Singing, Dancing, Cutting their Prisoners Throats, with their Blood
also anointing their Image. But if they were conquer’d, then they invented new
Offerings to reconcile themselves with their Idol.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and Places of chief note.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chief Towns and Places which the <i>Spaniards</i> inhabit here, are 1. <i>Panama</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>the chief City of the Province, being also a Bishop’s See, which is Suffragan to the
Arch-bishop of <i>Lima</i>, and the ordinary Residence of the Governor and Courts of
Justice for these Parts; It is seated likewise upon the South Sea, and so near, that
at High-water the Ships are said to Ride even under the Walls. Through this Town
the Wealth both of <i>Peru</i> and <i>Spain</i> passeth once every Year; from <i>Spain</i> by <i>Nombre
de Dios</i> and <i>Porto Bello</i>, from whence whatsoever Merchandise or other Commodities
come from <i>Spain</i>, are Transported to <i>Panama</i> by Land, and from thence by Sea
to all the Parts of <i>Peru</i>; and by <i>Panama</i> whatsoever comes from <i>Peru</i>, is sent
into <i>Spain</i>: It hath commonly a strong Garrison of Soldiers in it, and is doubtless
a Place otherwise well fortifi’d, being of so great importance. From the Haven
<i>Pericos</i> three Ways lead to <i>Panama</i>, the first along a Bridge over a River, whose
Banks are great Fortifications to the City, the rather because the River is deep, and
next to<a id='t396'></a> it a Pool over-grown with Weeds. The Way from <i>Nombre de Dios</i> plain and
without Woods, is wash’d by the Brook <i>Levendero</i>. The third runs along over a
Stone Bridge and Champain Grounds, that extend from the Haven <i>Pericos</i> to the
City. Eastward from <i>Panama</i> appear seven Royal Houses on a Rock, wherein the
Courts of Judicature are kept. Five hundred Rods into the Sea lies an Island resembling
a Half-Moon, and the Haven wherein the Ships when they unlade cast
Anchor, there being else not Water enough for laden Barques, and all lie dry, the
Tide being out: At the Mouth thereof stands a woodden Sconce. The Places <i>Venta
de Cruze</i>, <i>Chagre</i>, <i>Quebrada</i>, and <i>Ballano</i>, are also fortifi’d against any Invasion, where
else an Enemy might easily Land: But the strictest Watch is kept at the River
<i>Chagre</i>, which Westward below <i>Nombre de Dios</i> falling into the Northern Ocean,
brings the Ships up to <i>Venta de Cruze</i>, from whence a Way scarce five Leagues long
leads to <i>Panama</i>. The <i>Spanish</i> Commodities consisting most in Meal, Oyl, Biskets,
Cloth and Silk, are all brought from <i>Nombre de Dios</i> along the same Way; or else in
Winter when they cannot stem the Current of the River <i>Chagre</i>, then they bring
their Goods by Land, not without great danger of being taken by the run-away
<i>Negro</i>’s, who set upon them out of the Woods with poyson’d Darts and Arrows;
and as many <i>Spaniards</i> as they take, so many several ways they put them to death,
because they formerly in the time of their Servitude were us’d with all imaginable
Cruelties. The Provisions sold here at a reasonable Rate are <i>Maiz</i>, <i>Peruan</i>-Meal,
Poultrey, Honey, Cattel, Swine, Oranges, Lemmons, Cabbage, and all manner of
Garden Herbs or Plants. Round about the fore-mention’d Royal Houses lie Bulwarks,
with a strong Castle on one side. A fair Cathedral denotes the Place to be
a Bishop’s See: And the <i>Franciscans</i>, <i>Dominicans</i>, and Monks of the Order <i>De la
Merced</i>, inhabit several fair Cloysters here. Two Leagues Westward is the Haven
<i>Pericos</i>, which being secur’d from all Winds by three high Isles that lie before it, is
the chief Harbor in which the <i>Peruan</i> Plate-Fleet (consisting most in small Barques)
comes to an Anchor before they touch at <i>Panama</i>. The Countrey is for the most
part Mountainous, and in many places sends forth stinking Damps out of muddy
Pools; yet in some places are <i>Savanna</i> Grounds for Cattel to Graze in. The Air
would also be more unhealthful, if it were not clear’d by the Winds which blow
from the Sea. From <i>July</i> to <i>October</i> there fall continual Rains, mix’d with terrible
claps of Thunder. The Inhabitants often recreate themselves in Hunting wild
Hogs, with Nets made of the Brambles call’d <i>Nequen</i> or <i>Henachen</i>, and that after a
strange manner: for they set on fire the Bushes all about the place where they suppose
the Game to lie, which to shun the fire runs into their Nets; so that the
same Bushes are both their shelter and destruction, as affording Material to make
the Nets wherein they are taken. Besides other Birds the Woods also abound with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>Pheasants and Turtle-Doves; and amongst Beasts, those that carry their Young
about them in a Bag, as also wildcats. The Sea abounds with Fish, and produces
Crocodiles of a large size, by the <i>Spaniards</i> call’d <i>Lagartos</i>. The Trees are seldom
without Leaves, but bear little or no Fruit.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Nombre de Dios</i>, which hath broad Streets, high woodden Houses, and a fair
Church: It extends from East to West along the Northern Ocean, in the middle
of a great Wood on Moorish Ground, having a great Fen on the West; being situate
under an unwholsom Climate, it hath occasion’d the death of many People.
The Merchants which dwelt here had also Habitations in <i>Panama</i>, (the rest of the
Houses being most of them Inns for Strangers) from whence as soon as they had
gotten an Estate they went to <i>Spain</i>. The Countrey round about lies under Water
in many places. The Oranges, <i>Cassada</i>-Roots, and the like, which grow here, occasion
many Distempers to those that eat of them. In the Harbor, which hath on
each side a Ridge of Rocks, on which lies decay’d Forts, the Sea is often-times
so turbulent, that the Ships are forc’d to Ride at six Anchors apiece. Eastward
from the City a fresh-Water River falls into the Haven, on whose Banks stand several
Garden-Houses and Orchards. <i>Anno 1595.</i> Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> arriving here, found
a Mill beyond the City; not far from which on a Hill stood a Watch-house, of
which having made himself Master, he set fire on the Town <i>Nombre de Dios</i>, as also
on all the Vessels that were in the Harbor. The original of the Name <i>Nombre de
Dios</i> was on this occasion, <i>viz.</i> <i>Diego Niquesa</i> setting Sail with three Ships out of
the Haven <i>Carthagena</i> to the Golden Countrey <i>Veragua</i>, was surpris’d by a violent
Storm, in which two Ketches, Commanded by <i>Lupus de Olano</i> and <i>Peter Umbria</i> were
driven out of sight, whilest he suffer’d shipwrack, and getting ashore, rang’d up and
down in a desolate Countrey, where he found no other Food but Roots, till at last
he met with <i>Olano</i>; when the Famine began to increase amongst them in such a
nature, that being scarce able to carry their Arms, many of them were kill’d by the
Inhabitants with poyson’d Arrows, insomuch that of seven hundred there remain’d
scarce ninety: <i>Niquesa</i> shipp’d as many of them in a new Vessel which they had
made as it could possibly carry, and promis’d to fetch the rest off from <i>Veragua</i> as
soon as he had discover’d a Place fit to be inhabited: The first Place he Landed at
was <i>Puerto Bello</i>; from whence being necessitated by the <i>Indians</i> who gather’d together
to Retreat Aboard, not without the loss of several Men, he set Sail to the Promontory
<i>Mormor</i>, beyond which he Anchor’d in a secure Haven; where, as he was
going ashore he call’d to his Men, saying, <i>Saltiamo in tierra al Nombre de Dios</i>, that is,
<i>Let us Land in the Name of God</i>, and calling up a Fort against the Assaults of the Natives,
call’d it <i>Nombre de Dios</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>St. Philip</i>, or <i>Puerto Bello</i>, so denominated by <i>Christopher Columbus</i> from its
Haven lying along the North Sea, wonderful convenient and secure, by reason of
the good Ground for Anchoring, and a Creek in the same, defended from all sorts
of Winds; and which being surrounded with Woods, hath much over-flow’d Land
about it, as also abundance of good Gravel for Ballast; for which and several
other Reasons, the famous Architect <i>Baptista Antonelli</i> advis’d the <i>Spanish</i> King, to
build this City for a Staple of Trade (in stead of <i>Nombre de Dios</i>, which was found
unhealthy) having pitch’d upon an excellent Situation for it, <i>viz.</i> on a Plain at the
Foot of a Hill, where there are three fresh Rivulets, meeting with a fruitful and hot
Countrey: wherefore his Advice being taken, they first built a Fort at the Mouth
of the Haven, put five Guns into the same to defend the new City, and on the
Shore a strong Tower with eight Drakes: Moreover, the Rocks along the Shore,
and close Woods about the Haven prevent the Landing of an Enemy: But at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>the very time that this City was just begun to be built, Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> having
burnt <i>Nombre de Dios</i>, ran into the Haven <i>Puerto Bello</i>, where he found ten Houses,
besides the Governors Palace, and a Castle whose Breast-works which the <i>Spaniards</i>
had lately rais’d of Timber, Stone, and Earth, were all demolish’d by the <i>English</i>: But
the <i>Spaniards</i> have since re-built the same, and fortifi’d the Haven, with two strong
Castles, notwithstanding in the Year 1661. it was surpriz’d and taken by the <i>English</i>
under the Command of Captain <i>Parker</i>, and the Governor <i>Petro Melendez</i> taken
Prisoner.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>Nata</i>, commonly call’d <i>St. Jago de Nata</i>, situated on the West side of this Province,
upon <i>Mare del Zur</i>, or <i>The South Sea</i>, about thirty Leagues distant from <i>Panama</i>,
towards the Borders of <i>Veragua</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <i>Acla</i>, a Town upon the same Coast, but lying South-East of <i>Nombre de Dios</i>:
It was at first onely a Fort built by <i>Peter de Arias</i>, but afterwards grew up into a
small City, of which at present there is nothing remaining but the remembrance of
the famous <i>Vasquez Nunnez</i>, Beheaded by his Father-in-law <i>Arias</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. Lastly, <i>La Crux Real</i>, a few Leagues distant from <i>Panama</i>, for the most part
inhabited by a sort of <i>Negro</i>’s call’d <i>Simmerones</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Along the North Coast of <i>Panama</i> are two small woody Islands call’d <i>Cattiva</i> and
<i>Comagre</i>, lying low in the Water; also the Isle <i>De Pines</i>, which rises high out of the
Sea near the Main Land.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Isles of Pearls</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>On the Southern Coast are <i>Isole de las Perlas</i>, or <i>The Isles of Pearls</i>, about twenty
five in number, but indeed rather Rocks than Islands, excepting two, <i>viz.</i> <i>Tararequi</i>
and <i>Del Rios</i> where in former times the <i>Indians</i> took great store of Pearls, by diving
for them to the bottom of the Sea; and they were esteem’d of greater value and excellence
than those of <i>Cubagua</i>, and great profit was made of them by the <i>Spaniards</i>,
till by their Cruelties exercis’d upon the Natives through excessive greediness, they
depopulated the Islands, and lost that altogether of which before they were so insatiable:
they are now onely inhabited by a few <i>Moors</i> and other Slaves, who keep
Cattel there for their Masters.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Captain <i>Oxenham</i>’s Expedition.</div>

<p class='c010'>It will not seem amiss to conclude our Description of <i>Panama</i> with a short Account
of the <i>English</i> Captain <i>John Oxenham</i>’s Exploits in these Parts: He being incited
by the Treasure which Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> fetch’d from hence, resolv’d to Steer
for the Northern Coast of <i>Panama</i>, where he hal’d his Ship of a hundred and twenty
Tun on Shore, and cover’d the same with Trees, buried his Guns, and march’d
with two Field-Pieces and seven Men up into the Countrey, and was by the <i>Indians</i>
conducted to a River which falls into the South Sea, where he built a Pinnace
of forty five Foot long, and Sailing into the South Sea, Landed on <i>Tararequi</i>,
one of the Islands of <i>Pearls</i>; where he soon after took a <i>Peruan</i> Barque with sixty
thousand pieces of Gold, store of Wine and Bread, and the day following another
which came from <i>Lima</i>, loaden with a hundred thousand Pound in Silver Bars, and
some Pearls; with which being enrich’d he return’d to the Main: The Governor
of <i>Panama</i> being inform’d of it, put a hundred Soldiers into four Barques, besides a
considerable number of <i>Negro</i> Slaves; over which <i>Juan de Ortego</i> having the chief
Command, was inform’d at <i>Tararequi</i> what Course the <i>English</i> had steer’d; whereupon
he pursu’d them to the River whither they were gone, which falling with
three Arms into the Sea, they could not have known which way the <i>English</i> went,
unless they had seen some Feathers of Fowls driving in the Mouth of the least
Branch, by which they judg’d that they were not far off; therefore Rowing up
they found after four days Journey the Pinnace hal’d on Shore, and watch’d by six
Men, who were order’d to stand Sentinel, whereof one being shot by the <i>Spaniards</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>the other five fled; whom <i>Ortega</i> pursuing, found half a League from the Shore a
Hut made of Boughs, wherein the Booty lay, which he speedily carried to his
Barques; but Captain <i>Oxenham</i> inform’d hereof, fell with two hundred <i>Indians</i> upon
the <i>Spaniards</i>, who having a Wood on their Backs made such advantage thereof, that
eleven <i>English</i> were slain, and seven taken, and had not the rest fled, they had all
been either kill’d or taken Prisoners: Those that were taken inform’d <i>Ortega</i> that
they had been at difference amongst themselves about dividing the Booty, which
was the reason of their staying so long: moreover, they discover’d where and how
their Ship lay; all which the Governor of <i>Panama</i> writ to <i>Nombre de Dios</i>; from
whence four Sail were immediately sent to find out the Ship and the buried Guns,
as also to take all such <i>English</i> as they should find preparing of Boats or Barques,
and bring them to <i>Panama</i>; whereupon very many were taken, who were all miserably
slain, except a few Youths.</p>

Province; and to the West, with the South Sea; of a more temperate Air by far
than that of <i>Panama</i>, and a Soil so admirably fruitful and lusty, that they say Melons,
Cucumbers, and generally all other Fruits of the Garden, are ripe and fit to
gather within twenty days or less, after their first sowing, but very much infested
by noxious Creatures, as Lyons, Leopards, wild Cats, Crocodiles, Serpents, and
Bats, after whose Bitings a Man bleeds to death, unless he washes the Wound well
with Sea-water, or stop it with hot Ashes; and no less by the unwholsomness of
the Air, which is infested by the many stinking Damps that arise from the muddy
Pools. The Inhabitants are sickly, and seeming generally to be troubled with the
Yellow Jaundice, never attain to a great Age: they go naked, the Men onely covering
their Privities with a Shell or Cotton-Cloth: The Women wear a Cloth
which reaches from the Middle down to their Knees, but if Women of Quality,
to their Feet.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sebastian</i> and <i>Antiqua</i>, by whom built.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spaniards</i> have many years ago made themselves Masters of this Province of
<i>Darien</i>, in which <i>Alphonsus Fogeda</i> built the City <i>Sebastian</i>, which was inhabited till
a <i>Spanish</i> Knight call’d <i>Ancisius</i>, <i>Anno 1510.</i> built <i>Antiqua</i>, and made it a Bishop’s
See, which by reason of the unwholsomness of the Place was remov’d to <i>Panama</i>,
when <i>Vasquez Nunnez</i> discover’d the Southern Ocean, <i>Anno 1590.</i> because <i>Antiqua</i> lay
on a low Ground between high Mountains, where the Sun burnt exceedingly,
and the Way to the South Sea, being three Leagues from thence, it was very troublesom
to convey Merchandise thither.</p>

<p class='c010'>But a worse Accident befell the Town <i>St. Cruiz</i>, which being built by the <i>Spanish</i>
Captain <i>Peter de Arias</i>, was ruin’d by the <i>Indians</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rivers.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chief Rivers are 1. <i>Darien</i>, which gives Name both to the Province and the
Provincial Town, and falls into the Gulf of <i>Urraba</i>, being a large Arm of the Sea,
eight Leagues over at the Mouth thereof. 2. <i>Rio de las Redas</i>, which runs in like

<p class='c010'>The chief, and indeed the onely Town of this Tract is <i>Darien</i>, built as aforesaid
by <i>Encisus</i>, a <i>Spanish</i> Adventurer, and by him call’d <i>St. Maria Antiqua</i>, and by others
<i>The Antique of Darien</i>, being one of the first Towns that were built by the <i>Spaniards</i>
on the firm Land; though there are who make mention of two other small Towns
or Villages, the one nam’d at least, if not built by the <i>Spaniards</i>, viz. <i>Los Angelos</i>,

<div class='sidenote'>Description of <i>New Andaluzia</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Eastward of <i>Darien</i> and the Gulf of <i>Urraba</i>, lieth the Countrey of <i>New Andaluzia</i>,
otherwise call’d <i>Carthagena</i>, from the Name of its principal City: On
the East it hath the Countrey call’d <i>St. Martha</i>; on the North, the Main
Ocean; and <i>New Granada</i> towards the South. It is for the most part a Mountainous
Countrey, and full of Woods, which they say yield abundance of Rozen, Gums,
and some very good Balsams; also a sort of Long-pepper, much sharper than that
of  <i>East-India</i>. But the Plains, by reason of much Rain, to which the Countrey is
subject, especially for some times of the year, of but a spewy and cold Soil. The
<i>Spaniards</i> at their first coming found it a rich Countrey, not so much from the Nature
and Profits of the Soil (though it be said to have some Mines in it, and those of
Gold) but by reason of a certain Opinion and Respect, which the <i>Americans</i> of these
Parts are generally said to have born towards this Countrey, insomuch that they
would be brought and buried there from other Places very remote; and according
to the Custom of the Countrey, not without good store of Gold and other
Jewels, according to the Quality and Condition of the Person that was buried;
of which the <i>Spaniards</i> soon gain’d Intelligence, and in ransacking the Graves and
Monuments of the Dead, are suppos’d to have found an infinite Mass of Treasure:
but those Mines are long since exhausted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nature and Customs of the antient Inhabitants.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Inhabitants of old suffer’d great prejudice by Tygers and Serpents; yet
nevertheless this Countrey was very populous before the <i>Spaniards</i> arrival here; the
Natives wore Cotton Aprons before, and Golden Rings about their Arms and
Legs, as also Strings of Pearl, and the like. The Women here, as in the rest of these
Parts, went with their Husbands into the Wars, and behav’d themselves valiantly,
shooting poyson’d Arrows, insomuch that <i>Martin Ambesus</i> took a Maid, <i>Anno 1509.</i>
who had kill’d twenty eight <i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Countrey <i>Urraba</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>To the Province <i>Carthagena</i> belongs also the Countrey <i>Urraba</i>, which is so fruitful,
that all kind of <i>Spanish</i> Trees and Seeds grow better here than in <i>Spain</i>: Besides
which it hath its own Fruit, as also abundance of Pine and Palm-Trees, whose
Leaves serve for Brooms. The <i>Guaiana</i>-Tree bears a sharp kind of Fruit like a
Lemmon, the <i>Guaravana</i> a kind of Cittrons, the <i>Mameisa</i> a Fruit not unlike an
Orange, but tasting like a Melon, and the <i>Hovos</i> a great Plum.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Gardens abound with the Root <i>Batata</i>, whose Leaves send forth several
Strings, which over-spreading the Ground fasten in the Earth, and take new Roots;
it is yellow without, and whitish within, and bears pale green Flowers, which at
last turn to a Cod full of Seed. These Roots roasted in hot Ashes, exceed our <i>European</i>
Turnip; and beaten and put in Water till it works over, makes a Drink,
with which the <i>Indians</i> Drink and Carouse till they are Drunk.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>Moreover, <i>Urraba</i> abounds in Venison, Fish, and all sorts of ravenous Creatures,
as Tygers, Lyons, and a particular strange Beast as big as an Ox, having an Elephants
Nose, Horses Feet, and hanging Ears.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Trees likewise swarm with Birds; and especially near Lakes or Pools breed
Pheasants and Parrots, of which some are bigger than Capons, others no bigger
than Chickens.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Mountain <i>Abibe</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Against <i>Urraba</i> juts the Mountain <i>Abibe</i>, whose length Westward remains unknown;
the breadth thereof in some places is about twenty Leagues; it hath
many Ways which cannot be travell’d with Horses. The top of this Mountain is
uninhabited; but along the Valleys, which are many and large, dwelt formerly a
People that possess’d great Riches in Gold, which they gather’d out of Rivulets
that fell Westward from the tops of the Mountains. It Rains here almost all the
year long, which makes the Ways very bad for Travellers to pass.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the Foot of this Mountain, towards the South, lie two small antient Casiquedoms,
if we may so call them, formerly inhabited by a valiant People, call’d <i>Tarabe
de Zenu</i>, whether chiefly the dead Bodies were brought from all the adjacent
Countreys, to be buried in great State, as hath been before intimated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and Places of principal note.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Description of <i>Carthagena</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The principal Towns and Places of note are 1. <i>Carthagena</i>, (so call’d either
from the resemblance of its Situation with the City <i>Carthagena</i> in the Kingdom of
<i>Murcia</i> belonging to <i>Old Spain</i>, or because the first Inhabitants were Citizens of the
said City) which was begun to be built <i>Anno 1532.</i> by <i>Peter de Heredia</i>, but fully finished
by <i>Georgio Robledo</i>, eight years after the first Foundation thereof was laid.
This Episcopal Metropolis is on the North wash’d by the North Sea over a plain
shallow Ground; on the Land side the Sea flows through a narrow Bay by the
City towards the Lake <i>Canupote</i>, which ebbs and flows equal with the Ocean, and
receives and discharges its Water through two Pipes which lie under a long Bridge,
joyning <i>Carthagena</i> to the Main Coast. This City boasted long since above five
hundred Stone Houses, being divided into twenty six large Streets, whereof four
are six hundred and twenty Paces long: behind each House is a Garden; and the
Church appears above all the other Buildings: The <i>Dominicans</i> Cloyster is also
fairly built; neither is the <i>Franciscans</i> inferior to it, who also possess a second Edifice
on the Main Continent over the Bridge. The Custom-house and Court where
the Courts for the whole Province of <i>Carthagena</i> are kept, are also stately Structures.
The Haven hath two Entrances, the chiefest whereof lies half a League Eastward
from the City, and the Western, call’d <i>La Boca</i>, is as far again; both very dangerous,
because of the many blind Rocks that lie before them. <i>Anno 1585.</i> when Sir
<i>Francis Drake</i> took <i>Carthagena</i> by Storm, the whole was fortifi’d with Sconces, besides
two Forts for the better security thereof, whereof one lock’d up the narrow
Mouth of the Haven with a strong Chain; not far from which stood an Abbey,
Dedicated to the <i>Franciscans</i>, and Wall’d round about; since which they have several
Out-works, Forts and Towers, to prevent all foreign Invasions. The City
grows wealthy daily by the <i>Peruan</i> Plate-Fleet putting in there before they go to
<i>Spain</i>, and especially by the Trade from <i>New Granada</i> along the River <i>Magdalena</i>.
The Island before the Haven, antiently call’d <i>Codega</i>, now <i>Carex</i>, inhabited by
Fisher-men when the <i>Spaniards</i> Landed there, is now desolate, the remainder of
those that were destroy’d by them being fled to wild places from the <i>Spaniards</i> Cruelties;
notwithstanding the People hereabouts were valiant enough to Engage
with them. But since the Devastation made by Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>, <i>Carthagena</i> hath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>receiv’d a more fatal Blow; for it was scarce fully repair’d, when five <i>French</i> Privateers
burnt the City to Ashes: which Mischief was occasion’d by a <i>Spanish</i> Seaman,
who being whipt by Command of the Governor, resolving for Revenge,
went from <i>Spain</i> to <i>France</i>, and conducted the fore-mention’d Ships to <i>Carthagena</i>,
where he reveng’d himself on the Governor; for finding him asleep, he first wak’d
him, and after having told him of his causing him to be Whipt, he kill’d him.
The Booty which the <i>Spaniards</i> carried from thence at that time amounted to above
a hundred and fifty thousand <i>Ducats</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Balsam of <i>Tolu</i> very famous.</div>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Tolu</i>, by the <i>Spaniards</i> now call’d <i>St. Jago</i>, twelve Leagues distant from <i>Carthagena</i>,
a Place memorable for the excellent Balsam which is brought from
thence, and commonly call’d <i>The Balsam of Tolu</i>; it is gather’d in a Spoonful of
black Wax, stuck under the Hole cut in the Bark of a low Pine-Tree, out of which
in hot Weather runs a Golden colour’d Gum, very soveraign, and of an excellent
smell.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>St. Crux de Mopox</i>, a neat Town, seated a little above the confluence of the
two Rivers, <i>St. Martha</i> and <i>Magdalena</i>, which waters this Province.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>Baranca de Nolambo</i>, a Place of great Traffick, especially for all Commodities
of the new Kingdom of <i>Granada</i>; it standeth upon the Banks of the River <i>Magdalena</i>,
and about six Leagues distant from the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <i>Buena Vista</i>, otherwise call’d <i>St. Sebastian de Buena Vista</i>, a Town commodiously
seated upon a rising Ground not far from the Gulf of <i>Urraba</i>, or the Sound of
<i>Darien</i>, about a League and a half from the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <i>Villa de St. Maria</i>, thirty Leagues Southward of <i>Carthagena</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rivers of <i>Carthagena</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Province of <i>Carthagena</i> is stor’d with many Brooks and great Rivers,
amongst which the Stream <i>Cauca</i> falls into the River <i>Magdalena</i>, beyond <i>Popayan</i>
near <i>Mopox</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The River <i>Zenu</i>, which gives Denomination to the above-mention’d Territory,
makes a very convenient Harbor with its Mouth, where much Salt is to
be had.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Daria</i>, which runs between <i>Panama</i> and <i>Carthagena</i> into the Inlet <i>Urraba</i>, gives
its Denomination to the foregoing Province, through which it also runs, as hath
been already mention’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>The River which for its greatness is call’d <i>Rio Grande</i>, or <i>Magdalena</i>, (because it
was discover’d on the Day Consecrated to that Saint) falls with such force into the
Northern Ocean, about twenty three Leagues Eastward from <i>Carthagena</i>, that running
two Leagues broad and ten long into the Sea, it retains its freshness of Water;
in which there lying many Rocks, makes the same very dangerous for Ships. In the
Mouth of the Haven lies an Island, which is divided by the River, the widest and
most frequented Channel of which respects <i>St. Martha</i>, where those that carry the
Merchandise up this Stream to <i>New Granada</i>, spend two Moneths in Toeing, whenas
they come from thence in three Weeks.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thunder and Lightning rages here many times after a terrible manner from
Midnight till Morning. In <i>January</i> there falls also abundance of Rain, which gliding
from the Mountains swells the River exceedingly.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of <i>St. Martha</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>St. Martha</i>, so call’d from the chief City of the Province, is border’d on the
West with <i>New Andaluzia</i>; on the East, with <i>Rio de la Hacha</i>; on the North,
with the Ocean; and on the South, with <i>New Granada</i>; It is about threescore
and ten Leagues in length, and not much less in breadth: It was antiently
distributed into several little <i>Seignories</i>, Govern’d by <i>Casiques</i>, or petty Princes, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Pozigueica</i>, <i>Betoma</i>, <i>Buritaca</i>, <i>Chimola</i>, inhabited by valiant Men and beautiful Women,
and above all the rest, <i>Tairona</i>, (whose People for a long time maintain’d
War against the <i>Spaniards</i>) lying at the Foot of the high Mountains <i>Sierras Nevadas</i>,
whose snowy Crowns are seen thirty Leagues off at Sea, and run along in a continu’d
Ridge through <i>Peru</i> and <i>Chili</i> to the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey was Discover’d, and part of it Planted, <i>Anno 1524.</i> by <i>Roderic de
Bastredas</i>, who afterwards was murder’d in his Sleep by his own People.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Nature of the Climate, and Commodities of the Countrey.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Sun shines so exceeding hot near the Sea-coast, that there is no enduring of
the same; but up in the Countrey the snowy Mountains occasion great Cold, and in
Harvest and <i>October</i> it Rains exceedingly, whereas at other times it is very dry Weather,
and the Winds blow generally out of the East or North-East, yet the Land-Breezes
coming out of the West bring sometimes Rains with them. From the
Mountains, which are stony and barren, fall many Brooks and Rivers, which water
divers Plains, the Grass and other Plants of which are often blasted by violent
Storms; nevertheless Oranges, Lemmons, Granates, and all sorts of <i>Spanish</i> Garden
Fruits grow here in great plenty. The Woods afford likewise Pigeons, Partridges,
Venison, and the like; the Rivers all manner of Fish, which are seen to swim in
great numbers twenty Yards under the Water, especially in the Haven <i>St. Martha</i>,
near which formerly liv’d many Fisher-men, who with Nets made of tough Twigs
pleited together, caught such plenty of Fish, that they furnish’d all their Neighbors.
The High-ways are made dangerous by Lyons, Tygers, and Bears.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Great plenty of Precious Stones in these Parts.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Peter di Lugo</i> his Treachery to the Natives.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Welsares</i> Journey.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey <i>Buritaca</i> affords the Inhabitants Gold; <i>Tairona</i>, excellent Stones
against Bleeding and the Gravel, Jasper, Porphyr, and Gold; the Valley <i>Tunia</i>,
many rich Emeraulds, which Stones us’d to be in great esteem before <i>America</i> produc’d
such great numbers of them. <i>Acosta</i> relates, That a <i>Spaniard</i> desiring to know
the Price of an Emerauld, shew’d two to an <i>Italian</i> Jeweller, who valu’d the one at
a hundred, the other at three hundred <i>Ducats</i>; but soon after seeing a Chest full of
them, said they were scare worth a <i>Ducat</i> apiece; and that the Sute which the <i>Roman</i>
Lady wore, being beset with Emeraulds, and valu’d at four hundred thousand <i>Ducats</i>,
would not sell now for half so much. This Stone or Jewel exceedingly fortifies
the Sight, wherefore the Emperor <i>Nero</i> represented the bloody Encounters of Fencers
in an Emerauld. It is also judg’d to be good against the Falling-sickness,
wherefore the <i>Indians</i> hang them in their Noses to this day, and adorn their Idols
with them; they grow in stony Rocks along Veins, not unlike Crystal, and in
time obtain a glittering Greenness; the biggest of them that are found in this Age are
most esteem’d of in <i>Genua</i>. The Emerauld Pillar, which as a wonderful Ornament
stood in <i>Hercules</i>’s Temple in the City of <i>Tyrus</i>, being very famous amongst
the Antients, was without doubt no more than a green Stone; and perhaps of the
same Material, was the Pillar erected by the <i>Arabian</i> King <i>Miramamolines</i>, in the Cathedral
at <i>Corduba</i>. But the great fame of these Emeraulds incited <i>Gonzalvez Zimenes</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>Governor of <i>St. Martha</i>, to leave his Place and seek for them; to which end he
Sail’d up the Rivulet <i>Gayra</i> with two Ketches and forty five <i>Spaniards</i>, who meeting
with the Casique <i>Bagotta</i>, got much Gold of him, and afterwards went to the
Valley <i>Tessuca</i>; of which <i>Simandoca</i> being Governor, conducted <i>Ximenez</i> twenty
three Leagues farther to an Emerauld Rock, from whence he return’d exceedingly
enriched; the rumor of which spreading up and down, made several travel thither;
amongst whom was <i>Peter di Lugo</i>, Governor of <i>Terra Firma</i>, who sending for
Aid from <i>Carthagena</i>, fought his way to <i>Bagotta</i>, who resisted him for some time,
till at last being defeated he made Peace with them for a considerable quantity of
Gold; which when <i>Peter di Lugo</i> had receiv’d, not regarding his Word, he plunder’d
all the Countrey, and having committed all imaginable Cruelties on the Natives,
return’d home with an invaluable Mass of Gold and Emeraulds to <i>St. Martha</i>.
Not long after the <i>Welsares</i>, <i>German</i> Knights, came from <i>Venezuela</i>, (which City
the Emperor <i>Charles</i> the Fifth Morgag’d to them <i>Anno 1518.</i>) and travell’d
through the snowy Mountains of <i>St. Martha</i> with <i>Indian</i> Guides, whose Instructions
following, they digg’d many Emeraulds out of the Valley <i>Funia</i>; the Inhabitants
of which affrighted at the sight of the Strangers, hang’d themselves out of
despair, though naturally valiant, and ingenious in working in Tapestry the
shapes of Tygers, Lyons, and other Beasts, and painting on the Walls of their
Houses variety of Figures of divers colours, covering their Floors with Mats neatly
pleited of Rushes. They fed on Fish, Venison, and Mans-flesh, and also on the
Roots <i>Agies</i>, tasting like Chesnuts, <i>Yuca</i>, <i>Maiz</i>, <i>Batata</i>, and <i>Cassada</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chief Cities and Places of note.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chief Cities and Places of principal note in this Province are 1. <i>St. Martha</i>,
which gives Denomination to the whole Province, it stands built at the North Sea,
which makes a large and convenient Harbor, being defended from the Winds by
high Mountains and two Isles, is a Bishop’s See, and hath a large Cathedral. The
Houses built of Canes are cover’d with <i>Palmito</i>-Trees, and some with woodden
Shingles. The Haven hath neither Fort nor Castle to defend it, because there is
no Trade but with the <i>Indians</i>, which bring Earthen Ware and Cotton Clothes to
sell; and because the <i>Spanish</i> Ships seldom come hither, the Place is much gone to
decay, and the more, because it is no way defended against any Assault of an Enemy,
which the <i>French</i>, and afterwards the <i>English</i>, under the Command of Sir <i>Francis
Drake</i>, and the following Year under Captain <i>Anthony Shirley</i> took advantage of, and
plunder’d and burnt the City.</p>

whose Banks are inhabited by the <i>Indians</i>, who are much addicted to Sleep and

<p class='c010'>The chief Towns of this Province, are 1. A small Town call’d <i>De la Hacha</i>,
which gives Denomination to the said Province, having no convenient Haven,
but otherwise seated in a Soil very rich and fertile, not onely of all sorts of Fruits
and Plants, especially such as are brought from <i>Spain</i>, but likewise in many Mines
of Gold, Gems of a large size and great value, and many excellent Salt-Wiches, as
they call them; It is eight Leagues distant from <i>Salamanca</i> aforesaid, and eighteen
from <i>Cape Villa</i>, the most Westerly Point or Foreland of the Bay of <i>Venezuela</i>; and
with the rest had the hap to be surpris’d and pillag’d by the <i>English</i> with Sir <i>Francis
Drake</i> in the Year 1595. who refus’d twenty four thousand <i>Ducats</i>, which the Governor
proffer’d him for the Pearls he had taken.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Rancheria</i>, six Leagues Eastward of <i>La Hacha</i>, inhabited chiefly by Pearl-Fishers,
or such as get their Living for the most part by Fishing for Pearl, which
was wont to be good on these Coasts.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>Tapia</i>, five Leagues from <i>La Hacha</i>, and considerable, for that the adjacent
Parts were laid waste by the <i>English</i>, to revenge the perfidiousness of the Governor
of <i>Salamanca</i>, refusing to pay the four thousand <i>Ducats</i> he had promis’d, upon Condition
of their sparing the Town.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Abibeca</i> the last King of this Province.</div>

<p class='c010'>The last King of those that Govern’d in any of these Provinces of <i>Terra Firma</i>,
was <i>Abibeca</i>, who could not be won to come down from his Palace, which he had
on the top of a Tree, till a <i>Spanish</i> Officer, one <i>Francisco de Vanquez</i> began to lay an
Ax to the Root thereof.</p>

<p class='c010'>After <i>Didaco Niquesa</i>, <i>Alphonso Oreda</i>, and <i>Anciso</i>, had made very large Discoveries
in these Provinces, <i>Valboa</i> was the first that discover’d the Way to the South-Sea.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>First Discovery of <i>New Granada</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The new Kingdom of <i>Granada</i>, as ’tis commonly call’d, was for the most
part both discover’d and conquer’d by <i>Gonsalvo Ximenes</i>, about the Year
1536. and with so good success, that in less than a years space, the whole
Countrey was quietly setled under the <i>Spaniards</i> Government, and the Captain with
his small Company had made shift to gather together such a Mass of Treasure as
may seem almost incredible, <i>viz.</i> from the <i>Reguli</i>, or petty Princes of those Countreys,
whom he had either destroy’d or made Tributary. But a more particular
Relation of <i>Ximenes</i> his Journey take as followeth:</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Gustavo Ximenes</i> his Expedition.</div>

<p class='c010'>Being sent out by <i>Peter Ferdinando de Lugo</i>, to discover the Countreys that lay
along the River <i>Magdalena</i>, he travell’d upon the right side of it with great trouble;
for not onely the brambly Woods, Moors, and deep Brooks, made the Way exceeding
bad to be travell’d, but also the Inhabitants, who fell upon him from their
Ambuscades: yet at last he reach’d <i>Tora</i>, which Name he chang’d into <i>Pueblo de los
Bracos</i>, because four Rivers unite their Waters there. Here ordering his Brigantines
which were come up the River to cast their Anchors, he judg’d it convenient
to stay all the Winter, because the swoln Rivers had drown’d the adjacent Countrey.
<i>Ximenes</i> observing that the <i>Indians</i> fetch’d Salt from the Sea-side, judg’d that
the Countrey was inhabited, and therefore in fair Weather march’d up to the
Mountain <i>Opou</i>, behind which he found a Countrey full of Salt-pools, which produc’d
Cakes of Salt. And somewhat farther the Province Govern’d by the Casique
<i>Bogata</i>, who at first resisting the <i>Spaniards</i>, was soon put to flight, when he heard the
noise of the Guns. The <i>Panches</i> divided from <i>Bogata</i>’s Countrey by a small Mountain,
also maintaining continual Wars with him, suffer’d the <i>Spaniards</i> unmolested
to travel through their Countrey, and the Valley <i>La Trompetta</i>, to a high barren
Mountain, on the top of which <i>Ximenes</i> found several Emeraulds; and going
from thence fell upon the Casique <i>Tunia</i>, and three days Journey farther, upon the
Governors <i>Sagamosa</i> and <i>Diutama</i>; from which three Countreys he carried above a
hundred and ninety thousand pieces of fine Gold, fifty five thousand pieces of indifferent
Gold, and eighteen hundred Emeraulds; all which the <i>Spaniards</i> left behind
with Guards whilest they went back to <i>Bogata</i> whom they found lying dead of his
Wounds on a high Hill: But <i>Sagipa</i>, <i>Bogata</i>’s Successor, receiv’d <i>Ximenes</i> with great
Civility, to engage his Assistance against his Neighbors the <i>Panches</i>; which he did
not refuse him: but afterwards he fell most perfidiously upon the said <i>Sagipa</i>, whom
he caus’d to be Executed, because he either could not, or would not discover where
those Riches were which <i>Bogata</i> had left behind him. After he had pillag’d the
little Region <i>Neyba</i>, and brought into subjection the whole Countrey, he gave it
the Name of <i>New Granada</i>, from <i>Granada</i> the place of his Nativity, being the chief
City of the Kingdom of <i>Granada</i> in <i>Spain</i>, and built the City <i>Santa Fe</i>; which done,
he quitted the Place, upon information that <i>Sebastian de Bevalcazar</i> coming from
<i>Popayan</i>, was seeking a Way Northward; and not long after him <i>Nicholas Federman</i>
follow’d, each claiming <i>New Granada</i> as their Right, whereas <i>Ximenes</i> alledg’d,
That the first Discovery thereof was to be ascribed to him onely: at last Agreeing,
they resolv’d that it should be at the King of <i>Spain</i>’s disposal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Nature and Custom of the <i>Moxas</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>The antient Inhabitants, nam’d <i>Moxas</i>, divided their Countrey into two chief
Principalities, <i>viz.</i> <i>Bogota</i> and <i>Tunica</i>, which before the <i>Spaniards</i> Arrival were each
under their particular <i>Casique</i> or Prince. The Men were of a good proportion;
the Women also handsomer, and of a fairer Complexion than their Neighbors:
Their Habit also consisted of black, white, and divers colour’d Cotton Cloaks,
and some also had Bonnets of the same. The temperateness of the Climate makes
little difference between Winter and Summer. Their Houses were of Planks, and
cover’d with long Rushes. Their chiefest Food was <i>Maiz</i> and <i>Cassave</i>, which first
grows on Stalks as large as Canes, containing very large and weighty Spikes or
Ears, each Ear generally yielding seven hundred Grains, which are Planted in hot
and moist Ground; one Bushel Sow’n, generally produces three hundred. But the
<i>Maiz</i> is distinguish’d into a courser or finer sort, which last is call’d <i>Moroche</i>, the
Leaves and Canes whereof afford a wholsom Provender for Horses, and the Corn,
Bread for the Inhabitants, who make it several ways; for sometimes they boyl it in
Water, and at other times parch it in Ashes, or grind it to Meal, which kneading into
Dough, they make into Cakes, Biskets, and the like: Moreover, <i>Maiz</i> steep’d in
Water, and after being boyl’d and set a working, makes a very strong Liquor. They
also use <i>Cassada</i>, which they make of the Root <i>Yuca</i>, which being large and thick, is
cut in pieces, grated, and all its Juice, which is deadly poyson, being press’d out,
is Bak’d in thin Cakes. There is likewise another sort of <i>Yuca</i>, which hath not so
poysonous a Juice, keeping good a long time, and is both wholsom, and of a good
taste. The Natives of old liv’d much upon the Roots <i>Yomus</i>, and <i>Cubias</i>, all sorts of
Venison, Fowls, and Fish, which the Rivers and Lakes afford in great abundance.
Those that are left of the Natives, are a deceitful, crafty, and ingenious sort of
People, very apt to learn Art, and to Trade with Salt to <i>Rio Grande</i>, and the
Mountain <i>Opou</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides Copper and Steel-Mines, this Countrey hath also several of Gold; and
the Fields produce all manner of Plants.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Nature of the <i>Panchas</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Panchas</i> which remain are yet a salvage People, but their Countrey is an indifferent
fertile Soil, though not in all places alike; for those which border upon
<i>Tunia</i> fed much heretofore on Pismires, of which some being long, have double
Wings, others lesser and without Wings; which last sort being roasted, are accounted
a great Dainty, and a speedy Remedy against the Distemper of the Gravel.
There are also a sort of venomous Pismires, which stinging a Man, cause a swelling
and great itching, and these are call’d <i>Tayoques</i>, whose Stings are cur’d by a
Plaister of bruis’d Pismires.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Bounds and Dimensions of <i>Nova Granada</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey is bounded on the North with <i>Castella Aurea</i> aforesaid; on the
West, with <i>Mare del Zur</i>; on the East, with <i>Venezuela</i>; the Southern parts of it
being not well discover’d, by reason of certain huge and unpassable Mountains,
which block it up wholly on that side, save onely where a Passage is kept open into
the Province of <i>Peru</i>, specially so call’d: It containeth in length about a hundred
and thirty Leagues, and not much less in breadth, being for the most part a
very healthful Countrey, and abounding in Mines of the best sort of Metal, besides
others of Brass and Iron. It is subdivided into these two Provinces, <i>viz.</i> <i>Granada</i>
and <i>Popayana</i>.</p>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Description of <i>Granada</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Granada</i>, specially so call’d, is a Countrey of a very temperate and good Air,
as hath been before observ’d, neither subject to over-much Cold, nor to
extremity of Heat; which is the more to be admir’d by reason of its nearness
to the <i>Line</i>, from which it is distant Northward but a very few Degrees.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns of chief note.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Towns and Places of chief importance are, 1. <i>St. Foy</i>, commonly call’d
<i>St. Foy de Bagota</i>, which was the old Name of this Province, and to distinguish it
from another <i>St. Foy</i>, in the Countrey of <i>New Mexico</i> above mention’d. It is the Metropolis
and Capital City of this Province, an Arch-bishop’s See, and the ordinary
Residence of the Governor, built by the above-mention’d <i>Gonsalvo Ximenes</i> upon
the Lake call’d <i>Guatavita</i>, and hath been long since inhabited by above six hundred
Families of <i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.  <i>St. Michael</i>, twelve Leagues Northward of <i>St. Foy</i>, and a well Traded Town.
The <i>Indians</i> that dwell about this Place being above five thousand, pay great Tribute
yearly. Not far from hence lies the Lake <i>Guatavita</i>, where the Inhabitants in
former times Offer’d much Gold to their Idols.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Commodities of the Countrey of <i>Tocaima</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>Tocaima</i>, fourteen Leagues Westward from <i>St. Foy</i>, within a Territory which
antiently belong’d to the <i>Panches</i>, who yet possess the worst part of it, lying still wild
and unreduc’d: It is situate on the Banks of the great River <i>Pati</i>, which falls into
the Rivulet <i>Magdalena</i>. This City, which enjoys the benefit of a wholsom Climate,
is surrounded with Mines of Gold, Copper, Silver, and Lead. And besides
the Fruits of the Countrey, all <i>Spanish</i> Plants thrive exceedingly after once Planted;
and though Sheep will not breed here, yet Kine, Hogs, and Goats increase daily,
but are often devour’d by Tygers, Lyons, and Bears. The Woods produce Nut-Trees,
Cedars, <i>Guaiacum</i>, or <i>Pock-Wood</i>, and the wonderful Tree <i>Zeyba</i>, whose Leaves
fall off every twelve hours, and grow again. The Fowls of this Countrey are many
and several. Near the City are sulphurous Fountains, whose Waters cure Scabs
and Leprosie. In the Valleys also flow Springs of salt Water, which thrown on
Herbs, turns to Rozen and Pitch, and is good to make Boats tight. The tops of
the Mountains are continually cover’d with Snow, notwithstanding some of them
vomit forth horrible Flames and Ashes, which are blown several Leagues over the
Countrey. The vicissitude of the Weather occasions two Summers and two Winters;
the first Summer begins in <i>December</i>, and the second in <i>June</i>; the first Winter
accordingly begins in <i>March</i>, and the other in <i>October</i>. This alteration of Seasons
is not distinguish’d by any change of Heat or Cold, but the continuance of fair
Weather during the Summer, and in the Winter, of such terrible Hurricanes, that
blow from North to South, or from South to North, with such Thundering and
Lightning, as if the end of the World were at hand. The chiefest Trees that grow
here are Cedars, and one that bears exceeding great Almonds. The <i>Quaque</i> also
bears a pleasant Fruit about the bigness of a Goose-Egg; and the Fig-Tree, Figs as
large as Oranges. The <i>Agnapa</i> which grows here is of such a nature, that an <i>European</i>
sleeping under it, swells exceedingly, but an <i>Indian</i> bursts. The Bark and
Sprigs of the <i>Hobo</i>, which grows high and round, serve against Swellings and Ulcers,
and occasion also Loosness. Sugar-Canes grow also here in great abundance,
amongst which feed certain Beasts like Hogs, whose Navels grow on their Backs;
and large Stags. The Fountains in most places of this Countrey run with salt
Water; and sometimes Salt is found between fresh-Water Brooks. The Natives,
who are valiant, subtile, and well proportion’d, are since their giving over eating
of Mans-flesh much increas’d, and many of them forsaking their Heathenish Idolatry,
have embrac’d the <i>Roman-Catholick</i> Religion.</p>

the Ruines thereof. This <i>Tudela</i> stood on the Shore of the River <i>Zarbi</i>, which running
between high Mountains, makes the Rivulet <i>Turatena</i>, and in the same Territory
as <i>La Palma</i> above mention’d, <i>viz.</i> of the <i>Musi</i> &amp; <i>Colymæ</i>, by whom the <i>Spaniards</i>,
who had here a Colony, were so exceedingly molested, that they deserted the same,
together with their Governor <i>Peter de Orsua</i>: yet not long after the forsaken Place
was again re-built by the Name of <i>Trinidad</i>; but that Place proving incommodious,
was again abandon’d, and a new <i>Trinidad</i> built, where now it is to be seen on a
convenient place Eastward from the high and cold Mountain <i>Paramo</i>. From several
rich Gemmaries thereabouts are digg’d store of Emeraulds, Crystal like Diamonds,
white Marble, and the Beryl, especially on the Mountains <i>Ytoco</i> and <i>Abipi</i>.</p>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Description of <i>Popayana</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Popayana</i>, the other part of this new Kingdom, is border’d on the West with
part of <i>Granada</i> last spoken of, from which the River <i>St. Martha</i> divides it for
the most part: On the North it hath <i>Nova Andaluzia</i>, or <i>Carthagena</i>; on the
West, <i>Mare del Zur</i>; and on the South, <i>Quito</i>, or rather some unreduc’d Countreys
lying betwixt them both; It extends in length above a hundred Leagues from
North to South, but in breadth, betwixt the River and the South Sea, not much
above forty or fifty. The Countrey is said to be a little too much subject to Rain,
yet not so, but that the fertility of the Soil answers the industry of the Inhabitants
in most places very well.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span><i>Sebastian de Bevalcazar</i>, Governor of <i>Quito</i>, marching <i>Anno 1536.</i> with a Company
of <i>Spaniards</i> to <i>Otabalo</i>, where the Countrey <i>Popayan</i> begins, was often set upon by
the Natives from their Ambuscades, and the many Inconveniences which he suffer’d
for want of Provisions, and trouble of travelling over the high Mountains,
had necessitated him to return, had he not been resolutely bent to discover the
Countrey; to which purpose marching on leisurely, he came into the heart of
<i>Popayan</i>, where his wearied People sufficiently resting themselves amidst a fruitful
Countrey, where they found pleasant Fruit-Trees, Houses full of Provisions, and
fresh Rivers, which glided from the Mountain <i>Andes</i>, and some of the Rivulets also
affording Gold, were encourag’d to build several Villages; in which nevertheless
they made no Settlement, either because they could not get Gold enough, or else
being driven from thence by the valiant Natives.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cities and Towns of chief note.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Places of chief note in it, are 1. <i>Popayan</i>, situate on the Banks of a fair River,
but not nam’d, and in the midst of a Plain in a place of great Wealth, and enjoying
a good Air. The original of the Name <i>Popayan</i> is from the <i>Casique</i> who Govern’d
there at the time of the <i>Spaniards</i> first Arrival. It is a Bishop’s See, and the
ordinary Residence of the Governor of the Province. The chief Buildings are the
Cathedral, and a Monastery of the Fryers <i>De la Merced</i>. The <i>Savanna</i> Grounds towards
the North feed many fat Cattel. The Fields produce the best <i>American Maiz</i>.
Some of the adjacent Mountains either vomit Smoak, Flames, great Stones, or scalding
Water, leaving a Salt behind it. Beyond the City <i>Popayan</i> the great River <i>Magdalena</i>
takes its original in the Valley <i>Cali</i>, where several Brooks gliding from the
Mountain <i>Andes</i>, inhabited by the <i>Cocunocos</i>, unite their Waters.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Antiochia</i>, otherwise call’d <i>St. Fides de Antiochia</i>, on the Borders of <i>New Andaluzia</i>,
and about a hundred Leagues from <i>Popayan</i>. In the midst of a small Territory
to which it gives Name, in the Valley <i>Nore</i>, between the River <i>Magdalena</i> and <i>Daria</i>,
wash’d by Rivulets, whose Sands are Golden, and whose Banks are shaded with all
sorts of Fruit-Trees. The Inhabitants white and very rational, sleep in the Night
under the open Skye: Their Houses are built a good distance from the Highways;
near which the Pastures feed abundance of Sheep. The Pools breed plenty
of Fish, and the Mines store of Gold, especially in the Mountain <i>Buritica</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>Caramanta</i>, seated likewise on the Banks of the River <i>St. Martha</i>, within a little
Province also of the same Name; the Inhabitants whereof being valiant and strong
go naked, and dwell in little Huts, make white Salt out of a Fountain and a little
Lake: they generally go to <i>Antiochia</i> in six hours, which is forty five Leagues, so
swift runs the Stream.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>St. Anne</i>, in the <i>Cantred</i> or Hundred of <i>Anzerma</i>, a Town neatly situate upon
the side of an Hill betwixt two Rivers, and in the midst of Plain no less pleasant
than fertile: It was so call’d by <i>Bevalcazar</i>, because the <i>Indians</i> of this Place name the
Salt <i>Anzer</i>; it is surrounded with Villages and Woods on a high Plain between
two Rivers. The Air being exceeding hot, lightens generally every day.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. The Village <i>Pueblo Llana</i>, which is inhabited by little People, who Trade in
Salt, and have also Golden Rivulets. Near this Place is the Valley <i>Aburra</i>, consisting
of many fruitful Plains, moistned by several Rivers; the Inhabitants whereof
at the <i>Spaniards</i> first coming thither, hang’d themselves, with their Wives and
Children.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <i>St. Jago de Arma</i>, built in a Wood of Palm-Trees, so nam’d from the Territory
in which it standeth, rich and famous for its Mines of Gold, which it is said to
have many and very good: The Ground round about being Mountainous, hath
several Rivers, the chiefest whereof call’d <i>Di Arma</i>, is dangerous to cross, especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>in Winter. The unwholsom Air hereabouts occasions many Sicknesses. Amongst
other Fruits that grow in this County, is the <i>Pytahaya</i>, which whoe’re eats, voids
Urine as red as Blood. Adjacent to it are the little Provinces <i>Paucuran</i>, <i>Pozo</i>, and
<i>Picara</i>, which possess Golden Mines: also the Territory <i>Carrapa</i> which hath high
and rugged Land, and many Rivulets: likewise the County <i>Quimbaya</i>, which abounds
with thick and long Canes, wherewith the Natives build their Houses; in
the hollow Bodies of these Canes the wild Bees gather store of Honey; and amongst
them breed also exceeding great Lyons, the four-footed Beast <i>Chuca</i> which carries
its Young in a Bag, Stags, Rabbets and <i>Guadaquinajes</i>, which being bigger than Hares,
are exceeding good Meat. The Mountain <i>Nevada</i>, wonderful high, and smoaking
continually, produces the golden Rivers <i>Tacurumbi</i> &amp; <i>De la Cequo</i>. Twenty Leagues or
more distant from <i>St. Jago</i> is, 7. <i>Carthago</i>, the chief City of <i>Quimbayaes</i>, and by which
the aforesaid Rivers run. The temperate Climate here gives Health and long Life
to the Inhabitants, who have several Fountains of salt Water, and the Fruit <i>Caymito</i>,
not unlike a Peach, black within, having little Kernels, and a Juice which Dyes
so deep, that it can scarce be wash’d off. Horses and Cows they have likewise very
plentiful. <i>Carthago</i> it self stands in a pleasant Plain between two Rivulets; the
Ways that lead to the same are very dirty, because of the continual Rain which
falls there, with Lightning and Thunder. A League beyond the City flows the
Stream <i>Consota</i>; near which lies a Lake, out of which Salt is made.</p>

<p class='c010'>8. The City <i>Cali</i>, the Residence for the Governor and Collector, lying under a
hot Climate in a plain Valley at a River, which falling from the Mountain, glides
to the Stream <i>Magdalena</i>. Round about the same dwelt antiently several People,
<i>viz.</i> the <i>Gorrones</i>, so call’d, because they nam’d a Fish <i>Gorron</i>, the <i>Chancos</i>, Giants,
with long Faces and broad Foreheads, the <i>Aarbacoas</i>, <i>Agnales</i>, and <i>Los Timbas</i>, inhabiting
among barren Mountains; but most of them were slain by the <i>Spaniards</i>, or
destroy’d by one another, few onely escaping to the tops of the Mountains. The
Countrey also swarms with wild Beasts, which have also devour’d many of the
Inhabitants, both <i>Indians</i> and <i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>9. The Haven <i>Bonaventure</i>, situate in a deep Inlet, about which live some Families
which send the Commodities that come from <i>New Spain</i> to <i>Popayan</i>, <i>Cali</i>, and
other Places; and though there be a Way along by the River <i>Dagua</i>, convenient
for Mules and Horses to travel, yet it is seldom us’d, because the Cattel are so wearied
out with the long Journey, that they cannot go through with their Loads;
wherefore they employ the <i>Indians</i> to carry their heavy Burthens over the Mountains,
which they do for a small Reward.</p>

<p class='c010'>10. <i>St. Juan de Pasto</i>, giving Denomination to the Countrey about it, and being
built on the pleasant Plains of the Valley <i>Atris</i>, is situate in a wholsom Climate,
and is moistned by several Fountains and the River <i>Angasmayo</i>, the Boundary of
<i>Peru</i>. The <i>Spaniards</i> have several Houses here, and breed store of Cattel, and especially
Hogs. They have likewise Sugar-Mills, with which they make abundance of
Sugar. The antient Inhabitants were salvage, deform’d, and of little Reason.</p>

<p class='c010'>11. <i>Timana</i>, giving Denomination to the Countrey about, is plac’d under a hot
Climate, yet the Inhabitants live long; they drive a great Trade with Thred spun
out of the Herb <i>Pita</i>; and also with Sweet-meats, Fruits Preserv’d with Honey and
Sugar, and especially a Kernel not unlike an Almond. In their Gardens they Plant
the Herb <i>Cocoa</i>, which they chew constantly for the strengthning of their Hearts.
Near <i>Pita</i> is a Mountain with Load-stones; and somewhat farther the Habitations
of the valiant <i>Yalcones</i> in the Valley <i>Aquirya</i>, the <i>Paezes</i>, <i>Pixaos</i>, and <i>Manipos</i>, which

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Peru</i>, so call’d, as some think, from the River <i>Beru</i> afore mention’d, in the
Southern part of <i>America</i>, was antiently a great and mighty Kingdom, as

the same manner that the Kingdom of <i>Mexico</i> did, <i>viz.</i> through the Dissentions
and Differences amongst the People themselves, as in the History of this considerable
part of the <i>New World</i> will be related at large hereafter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A most wonderful Rock.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>The Kingdom of the Kings of <i>Cusco</i>, which in some sence, and by some Writers
upon occasion, is call’d <i>The Kingdom of Peru</i>, was extended by the last <i>Inca</i> or King,
<i>Huayna Capac</i>, from North to South above a thousand Leagues together, comprehending
not only a great part of the Province of <i>Chile</i> towards the South, but
also the new Kingdom of <i>Granada</i>, and divers other Provinces to the North; but
<i>Peru</i>, properly so call’d, containeth little more than half so much, <i>viz.</i> six hundred
Leagues in length, and about fifty or threescore in breadth, except onely in
some places, as in the Countrey of <i>Chacopoyas</i>, where ’tis thought it may be a hundred
Leagues from the <i>Andes</i> to the South Sea: It lieth between the first and fifth
Degrees of Southern Latitude, and is bounded on the East and North-East with
that vast Ridge of Mountains which they call the <i>Andes</i>; on the West it is wash’d
with <i>Mare del Zur</i>; on the North it hath the Countrey of <i>Popayan</i>; and on the
South, <i>Chile</i>: It is commonly divided into three parts, which they call <i>The Plains</i>,
<i>The Hill-Countrey</i>, and <i>The Andes</i>; the <i>Plains</i> are that part of the Countrey which lie
along upon the Sea-Coast, being for the most part a meer Level without any Hills
at all. The <i>Sierra</i>, as they call it, or <i>Hill-Countrey</i>, is that part of <i>Peru</i> which is partly
mountainous and partly plain, fertile and well inhabited in both. The <i>Andes</i> are
so high, rocky, and inaccessible, that they are scarce inhabited at all but by Salvages,
save onely upon the skirts of them. The <i>Plains</i> from the Sea-shore to the
<i>Hill-Countrey</i>, are for the most part about ten Leagues over or broad, upon which
it scarce raineth all the year long. The <i>Hill-Countrey</i> is commonly twenty Leagues
in breadth where narrowest; and from <i>September</i> to <i>April</i> hath Rain, the rest of the
Year generally being fair Weather; but on the <i>Andes</i>, which take up all the rest
of the Countrey of <i>Peru</i>, it raineth almost continually all the year long. In the
<i>Hill-Countrey</i> their Summer begins in <i>April</i>, as is said, and ends in <i>September</i>; but in
the <i>Plains</i> it begins in <i>October</i>, and ends in <i>May</i>; so that in the space of a day a Man
may feel both Summer and Winter; be scorch’d with excessive Heat in the Morning,
and yet well nipt with Cold before Night. The <i>Andes</i> generally are cover’d
with thick Woods and wild Forrests. The <i>Hill-Countrey</i> is for a great space naked and
open; the <i>Plains</i> in many places sandy and dry, and would be much more scorch’d
with Heat than they are, but for the neighborhood of the Sea, which affords them
many cooling Gales from the South and South-West Winds, whose property, although
it be natural in other parts to be tempestuous, to bring Rain and foul Weather,
yet here there is nothing but Serenity and fair Sun-shine days all the year long,
although these Winds blow almost without ceasing upon the Countrey, and no
other at any time, whereas the <i>Sierra</i>, or <i>Hill-Countreys</i> have Wind from every Coast,
and such as bringeth all sorts of Weather with it, Rain, Hail, Frost, Snow, great
claps of Thunder, <i>&amp;c.</i> The Countrey affordeth not so much Cattel of the breed of
<i>Europe</i> as some other Provinces of <i>America</i>; but in stead of Kine and Sheep, the Woods
and Pastures are replenish’d with multitudes of the <i>Vicugnes</i> and <i>Pacos</i>, which are of
no less Profit and Service. The <i>Pacos</i> here are said to be as big as some young Heifers
of two years old, bearing a Fleece like Sheep, and their Flesh no less pleasant
than the Mutton of <i>Europe</i>. But the great Wealth of this Countrey lies out of sight
in the bowels of the Earth, <i>viz.</i> in those rich and (as they may seem) inexhaustible
Mines both of Gold and Silver, which, as ’tis well known, the Countrey of <i>Peru</i>
affordeth more than any other Province of <i>America</i> besides. The <i>Sierra</i> opens into
large Valleys, amongst the chiefest whereof are <i>Xauxa</i>, <i>Andaguailas</i>, and <i>Yucay</i>, all
of them well inhabited and fruitful. Below <i>Cusco</i> the Mountains <i>Andes</i> and those
of <i>Sierra</i> run a greater distance than elsewhere one from the other, leaving the great
Plain <i>Callao</i> in the middle. Moreover, several sandy Wilds, without Water, Herbs,
Trees, or any living Creature, except Birds, extend from <i>Tumbez</i> to <i>Taparaca</i>. From
the Valleys flow several Rivers into the Southern Ocean. On the Mountain <i>Pira</i>
is a Fountain call’d <i>Puchio</i>, which springs in the Night, but is quite dry in the Day-time.
Also near the chief City <i>Quito</i> in the Valley <i>Chilo</i>, is a Fountain whose Waters
boyl faster or slower according as any one speaks softer or louder; and when
not a word is spoken, it stirs not at all. If any thing exceed this for strangeness,
it is a Rock in the Province <i>Concuchos</i>, which is all compos’d of black and white
Stones, which are so neatly plac’d by Nature, as if Art had done a Master-piece,
in the exact placing of them one between another: but the chiefest thing belonging
to it worthy of admiration, is a wonderful power either to heal or hurt; for
if the black Stones in this Rock be touch’d by any, they cause immediate Death;
whenas the white ones cure all manner of Sicknesses, and being digg’d out, leave a
Seed behind them, out of which grow new Stones to fill up the empty place.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Iuca Garcilasso</i>, Extracted from the <i>Peruvian</i> Kings, tells us concerning Plants, That
he saw a Raddish which a Man with both Arms could scarce embrace, and that
under the shade of their Leaves, Horses might stand. But of all the <i>Peruan</i> Fruit the
<i>Cocoa</i> is the crown, which grows on Trees of a Fathom long in hot and moist
Grounds of the Valleys between <i>Andes</i> and <i>Sierra</i>; from whence it is carried to the
Sea-Coast in long Baskets by Companies of three or four thousand at a time on the
Backs of the Sheep <i>Pacos</i>. Before the <i>Spaniards</i> coming hither none might chew
<i>Cocoa</i> without the Governor’s leave: A handful thereof chew’d and suck’d in the
Mouth, enables a Man to travel two days without any other Sustenance, and mix’d
with burnt Bones or Chalk, it is accounted an excellent Dish; there is such extraordinary
plenty of them, that the Inhabitants spend yearly 90000 Baskets of the Leaves
in Pottage. The <i>Peruans</i> also esteem <i>Mamayes</i>, a Fruit which grows round, not unlike
a Peach, with two Stones, hard Rinds, and a well-rellish’d Pulp within, which
dipt in Sugar is a great Dainty; they grow for the most part in the Islands. The
<i>Guaiyavas</i> bears a wholsom and delicious Fruit like a large Plumb. The <i>Palto</i>, a
Tree with many Boughs, bears a Fruit resembling a Pear, having a hard Rind, and
within the Pulp a great Stone. The Fruit which grows on the <i>Annona</i> hath outwardly
the same shape, but white within, and hath many black Kernels, which
taste very deliciously. The Fruit <i>Andas</i>, so call’d from the desolate <i>Peruan</i> Mountains
on which they grow, resemble the fore-mention’d <i>Cocoa</i>, but differ from the
<i>East-Indian</i>, because they are full of hard shell’d Almonds, the like whereof grows on
the Tree <i>Cachapoyas</i>, which are not inferior to any <i>European</i> Fruits that grow on Trees;
in that part of <i>Peru</i> which hath its Name from that Fruit is the best sort, being exceedingly
devour’d by Monkies, who plucking the <i>Cachapoya</i> Almonds from their
Stalks, throw them on the Ground to break their prickly Shells, that so they may
eat the Kernels without hurt. The <i>Mille</i>-Tree, being a sort of Grapes, furnishes
with Wine. But the greatest benefit the Inhabitants receive is by their Sheep <i>Pacos</i>
and <i>Moromoros</i>, which carry great Loads, and feed on what they find by the Way;
their Flesh is good and wholsom, and being either Smoak’d or Salted, keeps good a
considerable time; their Wool dress’d affords <i>Cumbi</i>, of which they make fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>Table-clothes and Tapestry, which on both sides is alike. The chiefest Weavers
liv’d formerly at <i>Copachica</i> near the great Lake <i>Titicacu</i>: They Dye their Wool with
the Juice of boyl’d Herbs. It seems also strange to consider what Loads the foremention’d
Sheep carried, for besides all sorts of Merchandise, they convey’d the Silver
from <i>Potosi</i> to <i>Arica</i>, a Way of sixty three Leagues; but in former times they
brought it as far again to <i>Arequipa</i>; and though they carried two thousand Bars at
a time, amounting to above thirty thousand <i>Ducats</i>, yet they had no other Guard
but a few Herdsmen, who driving them slept with them in the Nights under the bare
Skie, yet lost none of their Riches, but when the bald Sheep call’d <i>Moromoros</i>, being
wearied with their Loads, standing still, stretch’d out their Necks, and looking on
their Drivers, on a sudden ran up into the Mountains, by which means the Silver
was oft-times lost, if they were not suddenly shot. The woolly Sheep <i>Pacos</i> have also
strange Tricks, for they often fall down under their Loads, and cannot be got up
again, but must be let alone till they rise of themselves. So soon as one of the
Sheep hath gotten the Mange (which the <i>Peruvians</i> call <i>T’ecarache</i>,) they bury them
alive to prevent farther Infection.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Customs and Habits of the antient Natives.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Giants antiently in <i>St. Helena</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The antient Natives, though differing in Language and Customs, yet went all
Apparell’d after the same fashion, the Men cover’d themselves with a Shirt, which
came down below their Knees, and over that a Cotton Cloak, the Women wore
woollen Coats down to their Ancles: Their Head-Ornaments were different according
to an inviolable Compact between the Natives of several Provinces; for
some were wrought, some plain, some divers colour’d Caps, with two, three, or
no Feathers, according to the Custom of the Place: They were generally of a
middle Stature; but those that were near the <i>Equinoctial Line</i> lesser. Their Histories
make mention also of Gyants, who formerly inhabited the Promontory
<i>St. Helena</i>, were each four times bigger than an ordinary Man, and fed not onely
on the greatest Sea-Monsters, but devour’d each of them thirty <i>Peruvians</i> at a Meal.
The Stone Images of these Gyants are at this day to be seen not far from <i>Puerto
Viejo</i>. They likewise kept for a longtime Annual Feast-Days, on which they lamented
the loss of the Gyants, which (as they say) was as followeth:</p>

<p class='c010'>A Youth glittering in glory like the Sun descended from Heaven, and breath’d
Fire, which rending the Rocks so terrifi’d the Giants, that they fled into a deep
Cave, where they were all kill’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Helvius</i> finds the Bones of the Giants.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Cornelius Whitefleet</i> relates, That <i>Helvius</i>, Governor of <i>Puerto Viejo</i> being stirr’d
up by the Report of the fore-mention’d Images, caus’d all the Graves to be broke
open, in some of which he found Bones, which they suppos’d to be Whale-Bones,
had not the Sculls manifested the contrary.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The original of the Kingdom of <i>Peru</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The original of the <i>Ingas</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Concerning the original of the Kingdom of <i>Peru</i> the Natives give this Account
of it: That the most antient Inhabitants flock’d together like wild Beasts, without
constant Abodes, Customs, Laws, or Governors, which salvageness is still retain’d
in many Parts, amongst the <i>Brasilians</i>, <i>Chunches</i>, <i>Chiruguanes</i>, <i>Yscayungus</i>, <i>Piloconens</i>,
most of the <i>Floridans</i>, <i>Chinchemecos</i>, and others, which degenerate from all Humanity.
In time when some kind of Government began to be observ’d, it was rather
Popular than Monarchical; yet generally those that were most powerful, valiant
and subtile, bore the greatest sway: Amongst whom the first that five Ages
since Commanded over the Inhabitants of the Valley <i>Cusco</i>, was <i>Ingaroca</i>, a subtile
and politick Person, who built the Fort <i>Pucora</i>, Eastward near the Foot of the
Mountain <i>Andes</i>, that so he might bridle the People which inhabited in those
Parts between the Rivers, Moors, and Lakes, where the remainders of the Fort are
to be seen at this day: Moreover, he conquer’d all the Countrey along the Southern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>Ocean towards the North and South, giving out that he was extracted from
one of the seven <i>Ingas</i> (by which Name the <i>Peruan</i> Kings have been styl’d ever
since) which came out of the Cave <i>Pacaritambo</i>, where they were preserv’d against
the Deluge (of which the <i>Heathens</i> in <i>America</i> had long since an obscure knowledge,)
and restor’d the drowned Families; wherefore every one not onely obey’d, but
paid him Tribute, and bound themselves to receive of him the true Religion,
which they desir’d he would teach them, as none knowing the same better than he,
whom they look’d upon as Extracted from the <i>Ingas</i>. Amongst these <i>Ingas</i> the chiefest
was said to be <i>Mangocapa</i>, who, according to their fabulous Tradition, climb’d
through the Window <i>Tambo</i> out of the Cave <i>Pacaritambo</i>, and produc’d two Families,
<i>viz.</i> <i>Hunan Cusco</i>, and <i>Urin Cusco</i>; from the first whereof <i>Ingaroca</i> affirm’d himself
Descended, and having first made himself Master of all the Countreys about
<i>Cusco</i>, rais’d the Family <i>Vicaquiquirao</i>, and laid out a great part of his Revenues upon
Gold and Silver Utensils, and Ornaments for his Person and House, which he in
his last Will charg’d that none of his Successors should inherit, nor dwell in his
Palace, but that every one should build a new Habitation for themselves: He also
erected divers Golden Idols.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Yaguarguoqu</i> the second <i>Inga</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Viracocha Inga</i> his great Riches.</div>

<p class='c010'>Some Authors begin this <i>Dynastie</i> of the Kings of <i>Peru</i> in a very different manner,
making <i>Mango Capa</i> to be the first thereof, and to have been Succeeded by his Son
<i>Chincaroca</i>, which cannot but be the same with this <i>Ingaroca</i> here mention’d. <i>Yaguarguoqu</i>
(that is, <i>Crier of Blood</i>, because on a time being Commander, and taken Prisoner,
out of vexation and exceeding grief he cried <i>Blood</i>). Succeeding him after his
Death, rais’d the Family <i>Aocaillipanaca</i>, and was Succeeded by his eldest Son, the
wealthy <i>Viracocha Inga</i>, of whom, when the <i>Spaniards</i> conquer’d <i>Peru</i>, went a Report,
that great Riches lay buried in the Earth with him; wherefore <i>Gonzalus Pizarrus</i>
tortur’d the Natives after an inhumane manner, to know of them where the
Grave of the said <i>Inga</i> was; at last obtaining his Desire, he digg’d for the Body,
which he found so well Embalm’d, that it seem’d to live, but no Gold with it;
wherefore <i>Pizarrus</i> deceiv’d in his expectation, burnt the Corps; the Ashes whereof
the <i>Indians</i> gathering in Urns, worshipp’d, though when he liv’d the Vulgar
were much incens’d at him, for taking upon him the Name of <i>Viracocha</i>, who was
their supream God and Creator of all things; but he pacifi’d them, saying, That
<i>Viracocha</i> appearing to him in a Dream, had commanded him to take that Name upon
him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Yupangui</i>’s Policy to gain an Opinion amongst the People.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Gross superstition.</div>

<p class='c010'>The fourth <i>Inga</i>, call’d <i>Pachacuto Yupangui</i> succeeded in the Throne after the Death
of his eldest Brother, who was slain in a Field-Battel against the <i>Changas</i>, inhabiting
the Valley <i>Andaguailas</i>, where the <i>Peruan</i> Army was utterly defeated, few of them
onely escaping by flight; among whom was <i>Yupangui</i>, who perswaded the rest to a
subtile Design, by alledging, That the Almighty Creator, angry at their Destruction,
had reveal’d many Secrets to him, <i>viz.</i> That the Creator in Heaven was
call’d <i>Viracocha Pachayachachie</i>; That he resented it very ill; That whereas he formerly
made Heaven, Sun, Moon, Stars, and Men, none worshipp’d him for it,
but in stead of him they reverenc’d the Sun, Thunder, and the Earth, who had
their Beings from him; That he would shew his Power against the victorious
<i>Changas</i> by an unexpected Assistance of an invisible Army. This being believ’d of
every one, stirr’d up the <i>Peruans</i> far and near, insomuch that in a short time a vast
Army being rais’d, presented themselves to <i>Yupangui</i>, who made good use thereof;
and also told them that <i>Viracocha</i> had decreed in Heaven, that he <i>Yupangui</i> should be
his Vicegerent on Earth; which the Army believing, set the <i>Peruan</i> Crown which
they had taken from his Father, on his Head: Thus promoted, he march’d against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>the <i>Changas</i>, whom in a bloody Battel he Conquer’d, and brought them all under his
Obedience: Moreover, he made his Soldiers believe, that they were not the Conquerors,
but invisible Men, whom <i>Viracocha</i> had sent, and who could be seen by none
but himself; and that after the Battel they were turn’d into Stones, which they must
seek for. Whereupon they gathering a great number of Stones on the Mountains,
<i>Yupangui</i> call’d them <i>Pururancas</i>, and order’d that they should be worshipp’d, and
carried with them into the Field whensoe’re they fought another Battel, hoping
thereby to stir up his Soldiers to be couragious, who firmly believ’d, that with the
visible Stones walk’d invisible Heroes that would certainly assist them. This Imagination
wrought so much, that <i>Yupangui</i>’s Army assur’d of Victory with the help
of the Stones, went on undauntedly on all Designs, insomuch that being fear’d by
all the adjacent People, he forc’d them all to submission. This <i>Yupangui</i> rais’d the
Family <i>Yuaupococa</i>, and plac’d a great Golden Image call’d <i>Indyllapa</i> on a Golden
Chariot, which since was religiously worshipp’d, and afterwards carried to <i>Caxamalca</i>,
for a Ransom of the <i>Peruvian</i> King <i>Attabaliba</i>, whom the <i>Spanish</i> General <i>Pizarrus</i>
kept Prisoner, and at last Strangled. The Councellor <i>Polus</i> opening <i>Yupangui</i>’s
Grave, found the Body Embalm’d, and no way defaced, but the Eyes cover’d with
thin Golden Plates, and on his Head appear’d the Scar of a Stone which had been
thrown at him; and though the Body had lain eighty years in the Grave, yet it
seem’d rather living than dead, being onely a little grey. This Corps, as also several
other <i>Inga</i>’s, the Marquess <i>Camette</i> brought from <i>Cusco</i> to <i>Lima</i>, so to prevent the
<i>Peruvians</i> worshipping of them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Greatness and Riches of <i>Guayacava</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Yupangui</i> after his Decease was succeeded by <i>Sopa Inga</i>, and he by his Son of the
same Name, who rais’d the Family <i>Ayoac Aillo</i>: The last (for nothing worthy of
memory was done by either of them,) was succeeded by <i>Guaynacava</i>, a wealthy and
valiant young Man, who was no sooner setled on the Throne, but he manag’d all
things with great prudence, maintain’d War with several People, and conquer’d
the Kingdom of <i>Quito</i>, four hundred Leagues beyond <i>Cusco</i>, whither after his Death
his Body was carried, and buried in the famous Temple of the Sun, but his Entrails
were buried in <i>Quito</i> not without many bloody Offerings, thousands of his Servants
Sacrificing themselves at his Grave willingly, that so they might serve their Prince
in the other World. The invaluable Treasures which he left behind him were carefully
hid by the <i>Peruvians</i> till the <i>Spaniards</i> conquer’d that Countrey: The pav’d
Ways, magnificent Buildings, and strong Castles, testifie as yet the Power of this
<i>Inga</i>; wherefore in his life-time he was honor’d as a God. His Mother <i>Mamaoclo</i> liv’d
to see above three hundred of her Children’s Children, all Extracted from her Son
<i>Guaynacava</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>War between <i>Huascar</i> and his Brother <i>Attabaliba</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Huascar</i> burnt alive.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chief of the Family <i>Tanebamba</i> were <i>Huascar</i> and <i>Attabaliba</i>, Sons to <i>Guaynacava</i>,
(both by the <i>Coya</i>, or lawful Queen, however some have deliver’d to the contrary)
who falling at variance betwixt themselves, resolv’d to decide the Quarrel by a
Field-Battel, in which <i>Attabaliba</i>, being the youngest, was Conqueror. This Civil
War was at the heighth when the <i>Spaniards</i> invaded <i>Peru</i>, which they could never
have conquer’d, had not the Realm been so divided. During <i>Attabaliba</i>’s Imprisonment
by <i>Pizarrus</i>, his two Generals, <i>Quizaniz</i> and <i>Chilicuchima</i>, took the <i>Inga
Huascar</i> (formerly call’d <i>Tito Cusi Gualpa</i>, <i>Attabaliba</i>’s Brother) in <i>Cusco</i>, and carrying
him to the Valley <i>Sacsahuana</i>, burnt him alive. It is set down as remarkable,
that <i>Huascar</i> after his being vanquish’d, made great Offerings to <i>Viracocha</i>, thereby
to gain his assistance in his extremity against <i>Attabaliba</i>; when he was inform’d, that
a strange People which came from a remote Place over the Seas, had defeated <i>Attabaliba</i>’s
Army, and taken him Prisoner: From which News <i>Huascar</i> taking courage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>call’d the <i>Spaniards</i> <i>Viracochas</i>, and judg’d that they were come from Heaven to his
Delivery, and the more, because his Brother had spilt so much Blood already: for
<i>Attabaliba</i> had not onely slain the Prince <i>Atoco</i>, which led <i>Huascar</i>’s Army, with
three thousand two hundred Men, and drank out of <i>Atoco</i>’s Skull tipt with Gold,
but had also pluck’d out the Harts of above a thousand Children, which the <i>Cannarites</i>
sent with Palm-Boughs to him, to desire Peace.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Mango Inga</i> Settles in the Mountain <i>Vilcabamba</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>After <i>Attabaliba</i>’s and <i>Huascar</i>’s Decease, <i>Mango Inga</i> their Brother drove all the
<i>Spaniards</i> out of <i>Cusco</i>, whither they not long after coming with new Forces, necessitated
<i>Mango</i>, not without the loss of many Men, to take his flight up into the
Mountain <i>Vilcabamba</i>, where he Setling, his Successors Reign to this day, secur’d
from any Invasion by the natural strength of the Place. But the <i>Inga Saritopa</i> coming
from the fore-mention’d Mountain, submitted himself to the <i>Spaniards</i>, who
allow’d him the Valley <i>Yucay</i> to dwell peaceably in; but the rest of the Family of
the <i>Inga</i>’s that fell into the Hands of the <i>Spaniards</i>, were all of them kill’d in <i>Cusco</i>,
not without great grief of the old Inhabitants, to see so antient and noble a Family,
by which they had been Govern’d in great State for three hundred years together,
put to death by common Executioners.</p>

<p class='c010'>The City <i>Cusco</i>, which was the Royal Seat of all the <i>Peruvian</i> Kings, was made
more splendid than ever before, by <i>Guayanacava</i>, of whom <i>Augustine de Tarrate</i>, describing
his Magnificence, relates, That when his Queen was Deliver’d of a Son, who
was to succeed in the Throne, <i>Guayanacava</i> kept a great Feast for twenty days together,
and on that day when the Child was to be Nam’d, a Golden Chain, each Link
of which was as big as a Hand, and contain’d in all seven hundred Foot in length,
was carried by twenty <i>Peruvians</i> to the Temple.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The manner of the Succession of their Kings.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Succession of the <i>Inga</i>’s was after this manner: The <i>Inga</i>’s keeping many
Concubines had many Children by them, none of which could lay claim to the
<i>Peruvian</i> Crown, but onely the Son begotten on the <i>Coya</i>, or <i>Queen</i>, being generally
the Kings own Sister, (whom they accounted lawful for them to Marry, as in antient
times did the <i>Egyptian</i> Kings) Inherited the Realm, unless the <i>Inga</i> had a lawful Brother,
who Inherited before the Son, though born of a <i>Coya</i>; or if the said Brother
had a Son, he obtain’d the deceased Uncles Crown before him, who in apparence
was the elder Heir.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same Succession was also observ’d by other Governors, which the <i>Peruvians</i>
call <i>Curaca</i>’s.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Burials and disposal of their Treasure.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Burials of their Kings were perform’d with great solemnity; and the Treasures
which they left behind were bestow’d in building of magnificent <i>Guaha</i>’s,
which were Temples or religious Houses, where a kind of solemn Worship was to
be perform’d, to celebrate the Memory of the Deceased. Some part of the Treasure
was also distributed amongst the <i>Inga</i>’s Servants; but the Successor inherited
not the least Mite of what his Predecessor had gotten, but was forc’d, according
to an antient Law, to build himself a new Palace, and purchas’d anew every thing
else belonging to it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Crown.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Crown or Diadem was onely a fine red woollen Coif with a Tassel,
that hung down over their Foreheads, which other meaner Princes wore hanging
on their right Ear.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Coronations.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Coronations were also kept in great Pomp and State, the Nobility and
Priests coming from all parts of the Countrey to <i>Cusco</i>, besides an innumerable multitude
of common People.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Noblemens Presents to the <i>Inga</i>’s consisted chiefly of Gold and Silver Vessels,
fine Cloth call’d <i>Cumbi</i>, all sorts of Sea-shells, and stately Plumes of Feathers of
inestimable value.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>Thousands of Sheep differing in colour serv’d for Offerings: moreover, the
Chief Priest sacrific’d a Child before the Image of <i>Viracocha</i>, on whom with great
Reverence he cry’d, <i>O great God</i> Viracocha, <i>we Offer you this Child, that you may keep our
Realm in Peace, aid us in time of War, prosper our</i> Inga <i>in all his Undertakings, make him more
powerful and greater than any of his Predecessors, and grant him wisdom to Govern this vast
Countrey</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their exact Form of Government.</div>

<p class='c010'>No People in the World can be more respective, and shew greater Reverence to
their Kings, than the <i>Peruvians</i>: for there were never any heard of in this Countrey
that ever Rebell’d against their Prince; the reason of which was chiefly, because they
always Govern’d with great Justice and Mildness, placing Governors over the respective
Countreys and Provinces, according to their several Divisions, greater or
lesser, with subordinate Power one under another, so that they Rul’d with great
strictness, punishing with Death both Drunkenness and Theft. Moreover, the
<i>Ingas</i> observ’d a prudent way in Government, <i>viz.</i> They kept their Subjects continually
employ’d: The ordinary sort of Persons of subdu’d Provinces were sent
to remote Countreys, and the Governors thereof kept at the Court in <i>Cusco</i>; and
Princes Descended of the Royal Blood sent in their Places to Govern the new gotten
Dominions: they divided the Inhabitants into Companies, plac’d one to
Command over ten, another over a hundred, and a greater Officer over a thousand,
and at last a <i>Prefect</i> or Major-General, over ten thousand; every one of which
Officers were to bring in an Account every Week to the supream Governor, who
was always of the <i>Inga</i>’s Family, what Men dy’d of their number, or how many
were born, a present Estimate of every ones Stock, in Cattel or otherwise, and all
remarkable Transactions that hapned. On the high Feast-day they were all to
appear at Court, and to bring in the Revenues gather’d out of their Substitute
Countreys. The main Division of the Countrey was into four grand Provinces,
call’d <i>Tahucantinsuyos</i>, according to the four Ways that went from <i>Cusco</i>
through the whole Realm, <i>viz.</i> <i>Chinchasuyo</i> towards the North, <i>Coclasuyo</i> towards
the South, <i>Andesuyo</i> towards the East, and <i>Condesuyo</i> towards the West. The Collectors
were divided into <i>Hanansayos</i>, Upper-Collectors, and <i>Urinsayos</i>, or Under-Collectors.
The <i>Quipocomayos</i>, or Accomptants, could cast up exactly with Buttons,
not onely what every Province, but also what each Man was to pay, and that according
to the ability of the Countrey and Person.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their stately Structures.</div>

<p class='c010'>Many were the stately Temples, invincible Castles, magnificent Palaces, and
other wonderful Structures built by the <i>Ingas</i>, the chiefest whereof stood in <i>Cusco</i>,
<i>Tiaguanaco</i>, and <i>Tambo</i>; the Builders whereof were sent for by turns out of the adjacent
Countreys, from which they brought exceeding great Stones, most of them
thirty eight Foot long, eighteen broad, and six thick, which were so neatly joyn’d together
with Mortar or Iron-work, that a whole Edifice seem’d to be one entire
Stone. Their Bridges that led cross the Rivers were made of Flags and Rushes,
fastned to each Shore with great Ropes. The like Bridge lay cross the deep Mouth
of the Lake <i>Chicuito</i>, on which great Bundles of the Rushes <i>Toto</i> being ty’d together,
and cover’d with Straw, so strengthen’d the Bridge, that great Loads were safely
carried over the same.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The great Riches of the <i>Ingas</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>No Prince ever possess’d so much Riches and Splendor as an <i>Inga</i> of <i>Peru</i>, each
Countrey presenting him with what was most esteem’d amongst them; the <i>Chiches</i>
bringing Sweet-woods; the <i>Lucanas</i>, strong Sedan-Carriers; the <i>Chumbibilcas</i>, brave
Dancers; and so accordingly every Countrey provided him with what they best
esteem’d, besides the usual Tributes which they paid.</p>

<p class='c010'>Those which digg’d the Gold and Silver out of the Mines, had Meat, Drink,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>and Clothing from the <i>Inga</i>, though at other times he enjoy’d the Labors of his
Subjects for nothing.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their several sorts of Tribute from conquer’d Countreys.</div>

<p class='c010'>When at any time he conquer’d a Countrey by force of Arms, he made them pay
from three several sorts of Tribute; the first was bestow’d in religious Offices. Each
<i>Guaca</i> or Chappel receiv’d also a Revenue from the late conquer’d Countreys, the
Fruit of which serv’d for Offerings to their chief God <i>Pachayachachu</i>, the Sun,
their Thunderer <i>Chuquilla</i>, and to the Souls of the Deceased, and for Food for the
Priests. The Religion through the whole Realm agreed with that which was observ’d
in <i>Cusco</i>. But the second Tribute fell to the <i>Inga</i>’s Family, or Relation and
Soldiers. Those who Till’d the <i>Inga</i>’s Ground, Sung before him in Festival Clothes.
That which could not be spent in the Court was laid up in Store-houses for ten
years together, against a scarcity should happen. Aged People, Widows, and such
as were decrepid, paid no Tribute. The third part was for the Poor, which had every
Year a piece of Ground allow’d them to make use of as they pleas’d. In unfruitful
Years they receiv’d an Allowance out of the Store-houses before mention’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Provision for the Poor.</div>

<p class='c010'>So likewise the Pasture, Meadows, and Arable Land was order’d for three several
Uses, one third for religious Uses, a second for the <i>Inga</i>’s, and the last for the
Poor. The Sheep being shorn on a certain Day, yielded the Poor a certain quantity
of Wooll to make them Clothes. As soon as any Beast grew Mangy (which
the <i>Peruvians</i> call’d <i>Carache</i>) they burnt them alive, so to prevent the spreading of it
farther. Those that belong’d to the <i>Inga</i>’s Family, wore all Clothes made of the
finest Wooll, and the coursest, call’d <i>Tabasca</i>, was distributed among the Vulgar.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Industry.</div>

<p class='c010'>Besides this good Order of Government, it is wonderful to observe the <i>Peruvians</i>
manner of Living, each learning from their Infancy not onely a Trade, but all
things which they accounted necessary in House-keeping, as Weaving, Tilling of
Land, building of Houses, and making of Tools requisite for both; so that they
never made use of one another on any Account. Moreover, Master Artists, who
work’d more for Pleasure than Gain, dwelt apart, being Silver-smiths, Painters,
Musicians, and Dancers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Habits.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Habits were heretofore of one fashion through the whole Realm, onely
the Covering of their Heads were several, by which the People of one Countrey
were distinguish’d from the other, according to an inviolable Law made many
Ages since; some therefore wore thin Caps, others broad Pleits, others little Hats,
others round Bonnets, others woven Caps, and the like.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Post-Stages.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Post-Stages, call’d <i>Chasquis</i>, were little Houses, each standing a League and
a half from one another, wherein dwelt certain Officers, who with extraordinary
speed convey’d the <i>Inga</i>’s Letters from one <i>Chasquis</i> to the other; after which manner
in two days time they convey’d a Letter a hundred Leagues. But since the <i>Spaniards</i>
conquer’d this Countrey, that Convenience was lost, till the tenth <i>Peruvian</i>
Vice-Roy <i>Martin Enriques</i> re-establish’d the same; for he allow’d a Sallary to those
Posts, that they might with speed convey all Letters and Packets from one to the
other, being distant, according to his Establishment, four Leagues.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their severe Laws against Malefactors.</div>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, the <i>Ingas</i> maintain’d strict Laws in criminal Affairs; for as they did not
neglect to encourage noble Atchievements (for whoe’re had done a valiant Act in
the Wars, was made Governor of a Countrey, or had a certain quantity of Land
given him, or Married one of the <i>Inga</i>’s Family;) so likewise they severely punish’d
all Malefactors: for Murderers, Thieves, and Adulterers suffer’d Death without
Mercy; yet they allow’d store of Concubines, and it was free for any one to Lie
with his Neighbor’s Concubine, but Death to have to do with any Man’s lawful
Wife, who were serv’d by the Concubines.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Marriages.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>When a Bridegroom Betrothed himself to his Bride, he gave her (and put them
on himself) a pair of Shoes call’d <i>Ajota</i>, not unlike those of a grey Fryer, which
were lin’d with Cotton if she were a Maid, but with Leaves if a Widow, who nevertheless
being generally younger than the Man, was to Mourn a whole year in
Black for her deceased Husband; till the expiration of which time she was not to
Marry another. Governors of Provinces and other Officers of State receiv’d their
Wives from the <i>Ingas</i>, who enquiring out the beautifullest and most accomplish’d
Virgins they could hear of, put the <i>Ajota</i> on their Feet, and gave them to such Persons
as they most fancied; after which if they committed Adultery they were certainly
put to death. The Marrying of Brothers and Sisters was also forbid, till the
Inga <i>Topa Yupangui</i>, Father to <i>Guaynacava</i> broke that Law, by Marrying his own Sister
<i>Mamoello</i>, and made an Order that the <i>Ingas</i> onely should have that liberty; nay,
when he lay on his Death-bed, he strictly charg’d his Son <i>Guaynacava</i> to take his
own Sister <i>Goya Cuissilmay</i> to Wife; and this incestuous Marriage produc’d <i>Huascar</i>
and <i>Attabaliba</i>, (though some say <i>Attabaliba</i> was begotten on a Concubine) in whose
time the  <i>Peruvian</i> Kingdom went to ruine. <i>Guaynacava</i> also permitted the common
People to Marry their Sisters of the Fathers side, but not of the Mothers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their manner of living.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Peruvian</i> Houses were antiently for the most part light and small; and for
their Table they made but little preparation, satisfying themselves with a little
Beer made of Rice, Bread bak’d of <i>Maiz</i>, dry’d Flesh, Fish, and Roots.</p>

<p class='c010'>In their Wars they us’d Slings, Darts, Arrows, Lances, Pikes, Halberds, Pole-Axes,
and Shields.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Funerals.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Funerals were also solemnly kept, especially those of Persons of Quality,
the Corps was carried out on a brave Chair, from which he was put into the
Ground, with two of his Concubines whom he best affected, and also three Servants,
Gold and Silver Vessels, <i>Maiz</i>, and the Liquor <i>Chica</i>, which the nearest Relation
spurted into his Mouth through a Cane; all which they did that the Deceased
might make use thereof in the other World. But before the Funeral the Relations
Mourn’d over the Corps several days, and after the Body was Interr’d, they
plac’d the Picture of the Deceased upon the Grave: but the meaner sort of People
had the Tools belonging to their Trade; and Soldiers their Arms plac’d on
the same.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Religion.</div>

<p class='c010'>In their Religion they had various Fancies; their prime God <i>Viracocha</i> bore several
Denominations, and amongst others he was call’d <i>Pacachame</i>, or <i>Pachayachachick</i>,
by which he was signifi’d to be the Creator of Heaven and Earth; as also
<i>Usapu</i>, that is, <i>Wonderful</i>. In honor to this <i>Pacachama</i> stood formerly a magnificent
Temple about four Leagues from <i>Lima</i>, where the Ruines still manifest its former
glory, it being the Place where the Devil answer’d the Priests, who stood with
their Backs towards the Image of <i>Pacochame</i>, bowing their Heads to the Ground, and
showing many antick Tricks. The second Temple stood near <i>Cusco</i>, in which the
<i>Inga</i>’s had plac’d the Images of all the Gods and Goddesses that were worshipp’d in
<i>Peru</i>; and before each Image stood an Altar: the chiefest of them, call’d <i>Puachao</i>,
consisting of massie Gold, was Dedicated to the Sun, on whose Forehead the Sun
was Engraven on a Plate, which afterwards fell into the Hands of the <i>Spanish</i> Captain
<i>Mancius Sierra de Lequizamo</i>; but because he lost the same one Night at Gaming,
this Proverb was rais’d upon it, <i>Lequizamo lost the Sun before it rose</i>, because he got
the Plate on which the Sun was Engraven in the Afternoon, and lost the same in
the Night: The Temple it self, built of great Stones, curiously joyn’d together in
<i>Mosaick</i> Work, and within link’d with Golden Plates of a Finger thick, stood full of
Golden Chappels and Altars; round about it were several Galleries, into which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>the Priests and Priestesses Chambers open’d. Near the River <i>Ticiquaque</i> a third
Temple, Consecrated to the Sun.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_484.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The various Idolatry of the <i>Peruvians</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>This kind of Idolatry was common to the <i>Peruvians</i>, with several other Nations
of the antient <i>Heathens</i>, as hath been before observ’d, which made them mock at
the <i>Spaniards</i> when they told them of a Crucifi’d <i>Saviour</i>, saying they had a splendid
God, who appear’d to them in glory every Morning. In the third Temple
near the River <i>Taciquaque</i> in <i>Peru</i>, which exceeded the other two, they worshipp’d
Thunder by the Name of <i>Chuquilla</i>, <i>Catuilla</i>, and <i>Intillapa</i>, which the <i>Peruvians</i> believ’d
to be a Man that Commanded the Air, and who being Arm’d with a Club and
Sling, throws down Rain, Hail, and Snow from the Clouds, and shooting Bullets
through the lower Region, causes Thunder and Lightning: They worshipp’d him
after the same manner as they did <i>Viracocha</i> and the Sun, with holding up of a thing
like a Glove, and sometimes Offering, especially in <i>Cusco</i>, living Children: Also
they ador’d the Earth of which they made the Goddess <i>Bathamama</i>; also <i>Mamacocha</i>,
the God of the Sea. The Rainbowe, which the <i>Ingas</i> carried between two Serpents
for their Arms, was also religiously worshipp’d. Amongst the Stars they
imagin’d <i>Colca</i>, by us call’d <i>Aries</i>, or the <i>Ram</i>, as chief; yet held several others of
peculiar Denomination, in veneration, of which they crav’d such things as they
wanted. The Shepherds ador’d the Star <i>Nereuchilla</i> or <i>Capricorn</i>, whom they judge
to Rule over the Beasts. Others worshipp’d <i>Machacuay</i> which the <i>European</i> Astronomers
call the <i>Serpent</i>, as commanding Serpents and Dragons, that they might receive
no hurt from them. Tygers, Lyons, and Bears, were Rul’d by the Star <i>Chuquichinchag</i>;
wherefore those who would walk free from those ravenous Beasts,
lifted up folded Hands to the Constellations representing the same. They believ’d
that there was no Creature living on Earth, whole Likeness the Heavens could not
afford; and that those which were on Earth were under the influence of those in
Heaven: from hence proceeded the Names of the Stars <i>Chacana</i>, <i>Topatatca</i>, <i>Mamana</i>,
<i>Mirma</i>, and others. They likewise attributed a kind of Divinity to Fountains,
Rivers, Rocks, Mountains, some kinds of Herbs, Roots, and especially the <i>Papas</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>of a strange shape, and had a veneration for all manner of Creatures that were of
an unusual form. When they travel’d they strew’d Shoes, Plumes of Feathers, and
<i>Cocoa</i> in all cross Ways and tops of Hills, by them call’d <i>Apachitas</i>; and if they
want the fore-mention’d things, then they throw a Stone for an Offering, from
whence it proceeds, that in all cross Ways, and on the tops of Hills, lie heaps of
Stones, which are accounted holy.</p>

<p class='c010'>The like fond veneration of Stones the <i>Saracens</i> are said antiently to have had,
upon a Tradition, That <i>Abraham</i> had enjoy’d <i>Agar</i> upon a Stone, and that according
to <i>Euthymius</i> and <i>Libanius</i>, he ty’d his Cammel to a Stone when he went to Offer
his Son <i>Isaac</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Images of their deceased <i>Ingas</i>, which they call’d <i>Guaoiqui</i>, were had in great
honor, and carried with them to the Wars, and up and down in Processionings,
and call’d upon for fruitful Seasons.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Peruvians</i> believ’d the Immortality of the Soul.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Immortality of the Soul, the giving of Punishments to the Wicked, and of
Rewards to those that do well, was generally believ’d amongst the <i>Peruvians</i>, but
not the Resurrection of the Dead. Many suffer’d themselves to be buried with their
Friends, that they might accompany them to the other World. When the Inga
<i>Guaynacava</i> was buried, above a thousand of his Courtiers Sung several Songs, kept
a great Feast, and went with great joy to be buried with him, that so they might
serve their King on the other side of the Mountains. They Offer’d likewise a great
number of Children, and with their Blood cross’d their Faces from one Ear to another:
But this barbarous Offering was never us’d but at the Death of prime Persons
of Quality; for the meaner sort of People set onely Meat on the Graves, and
gave the Dead two Sutes of Apparel, put Money in their Mouthes and Hands; for
they believ’d that the Souls ranging up and down from place to place, suffer’d many
inconveniences.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Oracle.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Nunneries.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Offerings.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Peruvian</i> Images consisted generally of Gold, Silver, Stone, or Wood, all of
them strangely deform’d: Some of them were said to give Responces like the
Oracle at <i>Delphos</i> and <i>Dodona</i>, chiefly in the Temple <i>Pacachama</i>, whose greatness is sufficiently
manifest by the Ruines of its Walls beyond <i>Lima</i>, where <i>Franciscus Pizarrus</i>
got an invaluable Treasure. Each <i>Peruvian</i> Province had a Temple, besides which,
in the Cities, Villages, and Hamlets, were Chappels of Ease, into which the Priests
went at Night with their Backs towards the Idol, bended Heads and Bodies; in
which posture they requested to know future Events, and were many times answer’d
(if we may believe their Reports) in a terrible Voice. The great Temple at <i>Cusco</i>,
wherein the <i>Ingas</i> had plac’d all the <i>Peruvian</i> Idols, is now turn’d into a <i>Dominican</i>
Cloyster. In each Province of <i>Peru</i> was also a Nunnery (if we may so term it) or Habitation
of devoted Virgins, call’d <i>Allaguau</i>, i.e. <i>A House of the Choicest</i>, over which Was
plac’d a Governor nam’d <i>Appopanaca</i>, to whom none durst deny their Daughters;
some of which were styl’d <i>Wives of the Sun</i>, and others Servant-Maids to the same:
The Wives Cloth’d in Embroyder’d Coats, adorn’d the Temple, whilest the Maids
kept clean the Walls and Floor. When they attain’d to fourteen Years of Age,
some were chosen out from the rest, and oblig’d to perpetual Virginity and solitude
of Life in their Chappels; which sacred Obligation if they broke by suffering
any to Lie with them, they were buried alive after the manner of the Vestal Virgins,
the Ceremony whereof is related by <i>Plutarch</i>: Others were oblig’d to make daily
Offerings; others to make peculiar Sacrifices for the <i>Inga</i>’s Health, and happy
Events in War; many also were employ’d in the Court Service to wait upon the
<i>Inga</i>’s Wife or Concubines; and those being absolv’d from their Vow, were oft-times
Married to Courtiers. These Nunneries were Endow’d with great Revenues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>from the <i>Chacaras</i>, or Church-Lands. Their Offerings were (for sometimes they
Offer’d to their Idols the highly esteem’d Herb <i>Cocoa</i>, <i>Maiz</i>, several colour’d Plumes,
Sea-Monsters, Gold and Silver Images of Beasts, fine Clothes call’d <i>Cumbi</i>, Sweet-wood,
and Tallow to burn) either to have success in their Journeys, Trades, or for
the preservation of Health, or to obtain a plentiful Harvest. But their usual Offerings
were <i>Cuces</i>, a sort of Toads, which were eaten by the <i>Peruvians</i>. When they
were to do any Business of consequence, then Persons of Quality kill’d their Sheep
<i>Pacos</i>, not without strange observation of the colour and number of them, as also
of the time; all which things well consider’d, they cook the Sheep and laid it cross
their right Arm, turn’d the Face thereof towards the Sun, and mutter’d several
words to themselves according to the colour; for if it was spotted grey, they
spoke to <i>Chuquilla</i>, or Thunder; if white and short Fleec’d, to the Sun; if well
Fleec’d, to <i>Viracocha</i>. In <i>Cusco</i> they Offer’d daily a short-fleec’d Sheep to the Sun in
this manner: Making a great Fire call’d <i>Vibbacaronca</i>, the Priests threw the Sheep
and four Baskets of <i>Cocoa</i> into it. Their Sacrifices <i>Cozocovicca</i> and <i>Sapovicca</i>, to obtain
Conquests, were also very strange: for they gather’d out of <i>Puna</i> (which is a
desolate place) several sorts of Brambles and Bushes nam’d <i>Ganilli</i>, which being
all set on fire, they went about the Fire with round Stones in their Hands, on
which were painted Serpents, Lyons, Toads, and Tygers, crying, <i>Usachum, grant us
Conquest</i>, together with this Prayer, <i>Destroy, O Creator, the power of our Enemies Gods</i>;
which said, several starv’d Sheep were brought out, which for that reason they
call’d <i>Urca</i>; whose Hearts having torn out they began their Prayers afresh, saying,
<i>Mighty</i> Viracocha, <i>thus do thou pull out the Hearts of our Enemies</i>. For the prosperity of
the <i>Ingas</i> they kill’d in an open Field black Dogs, by them call’d <i>Appurucos</i>, whose
Flesh was eaten with many Ceremonies by People appointed for that purpose.
They made Offerings also to the Fountains, Rivers, Brooks, and Sea-shells, under
pretence that those Shells were Daughters of the Ocean, and the Ocean the Father
of Streams and Springs; when they had Sow’n their Fields, their Priests, chose to that
Office, went from House to House to gather such Offerings as every one was pleas’d
to give; which they laid at the Banks of several Sluces, at the time when the Water
began to rise there, thinking by that Oblation to keep them from over-flowing their
Lands, and washing away their Seed. In all places where two Rivers joyn’d together
they wash’d themselves, having first bedaub’d themselves all over with stamp’d
<i>Maiz</i>, and afterwards look’d upon themselves as well purg’d from Sin; which
power they ascrib’d to their Baths. To strangle Children between four and ten
years of Age was never us’d, unless upon the <i>Inga</i>’s being sick, or when he
receiv’d the Royal Tassel, that from the death of the Children he might receive
Health, or Reign prosperously. The fore-mention’d Nuns that were chose to attend
on the King’s, were also strangled when the <i>Inga</i> was sick; nay, sometimes
a Father would Offer his Son to <i>Viracocha</i>, on the Sun-Priest’s suggestion, That by his
Son’s death he would recover from his Sickness, Praying to the foremention’d Deity,
that they would be pleas’d to save the sick Father, because the Son had with
his Death paid for his Fathers.</p>

<p class='c010'>This kind of Cruelty the Devil seem’d to prompt the <i>Heathens</i> to, by making use
of <i>Abraham</i>’s Example, who prepar’d his Son <i>Isaac</i> for a Sacrifice on Mount <i>Moria</i>;
and that it was a Practice amongst the antient <i>Ammonites</i> and <i>Moabites</i>, and other
<i>Heathens</i> (by which even the Children of <i>Israel</i> were apt to be seduc’d) appears from
the Scripture it self: the Ceremonies of which bruitish Customs, with the seven
Brazen Chambers of <i>Moloch</i>, may be seen describ’d by <i>Rabbi Solomon</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their High Feasts.</div>

<p class='c010'>The high Feast <i>Capacrayne</i>, which the <i>Peruvians</i> kept in the first Moneth <i>Rayme</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>agreeing with our <i>December</i>, deserves serious observation: for as long as the Feast
lasted, no Stranger was suffer’d to Lodge in <i>Cusco</i>, whither they all flock’d again
after the Feast was over, to receive Cakes made by the <i>Mamaconas</i> (an Order of
Nuns) of <i>Maiz</i> and the warm Blood of a white Ram, and were distributed by certain
Priests (Extracted from the Royal Family <i>Iluqui Yupangui</i>) who carrying them
up and down in Golden Dishes, gave every one of a Company one, saying at the
delivery of it, <i>If you do not Reverence the Sun and</i> Inga, <i>this Food will witness against you
to your Ruine; but if you worship them, then their Bodies will by this Pledge be united to yours</i>:
after which those that had eaten of the Cakes promis’d Obedience, and thank’d the
Sun and <i>Inga</i> for their Food.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Manner of Confessions.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Penances.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Esteem of their Soothsayers.</div>

<p class='c010'>At the fore-mention’d <i>Chasquis</i> a course was taken to carry all that desir’d, to every
Temple through the whole Kingdom of <i>Peru</i>, where the Inhabitants receiv’d
them with great Reverence, having before confess’d all their sins to their <i>Yaburies</i>,
or Father-Confessors, who being chosen to that Office with a great deal of Ceremony,
impos’d greater or lesser Penances, according to the sins of the Penitent: those
that were suspected to have conceal’d any of their sins, were put to cast Lots, or had
the Entrails of the Beasts which they had kill’d to that purpose consulted about them,
and thereby were discover’d if they had conceal’d any of their sins; which whenever
it hapned, the Priests falling upon the false Penitents, thump’d them with a
Stone on their Backs so long, till they had confess’d all their Faults, which the Priest
was not to reveal on pain of Death, but to make Expiatory Offerings. The sins
about which they were Examin’d, were chiefly Theft, Murder, Adultery, preparing
of Poyson, or sleighting their <i>Inga</i> or Gods; for each of which Transgressions
they had several kinds of Punishments. When the <i>Inga</i> fell sick, all People in general
were forc’d to come and make Confession of their sins; also every one went
to his Confessor when he was in trouble, or expected some Misfortune to befall
him: The <i>Inga</i> himself Confess’d his sins to none but the Sun, which he desir’d to relate
to <i>Viracocha</i>, and to beg pardon of him for the same; which done, he bath’d himself
in a running Stream, and cry’d, <i>I have made my sins known to thee, O Sun; do thou,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>O River, wash away mine Iniquities, and discharge them into the Sea, that they may never be
more laid to my charge</i>: which custom of Bathing, call’d <i>Opacuna</i>, was also us’d by all
other Penitents. A Father losing his Son by Death, was censur’d for a great Sinner,
wherefore he could not be permitted to be Confess’d before he had been whipp’d
with Nettles by a certain ill-look’d Officer appointed for that end; after which
their Fathers <i>Ychuris</i> enjoyn’d such Penances as they thought fit; some were order’d
to last several days; others to pay rich Garments, Silver, Gold, or the like; others
receiv’d a certain number of Blows; some were condemn’d to live on the Mountains,
excluded from the society of all Men. If their Sorcerers at any time foretold
a Fathers Death, then he immediately Sacrifis’d his Son, that with his Death
he might buy his own Life. No People were more respected than their Soothsayers,
as Men that could discover private Thefts, Accidents that hapned in remote
Countreys, and also future Events, and so far their Credit amongst the Vulgar
carried them, that they undertook to tell the <i>Spaniards</i> when their Countrey-men
should be Conquerors, and when defeated in the War they maintain’d against the
<i>Netherlanders</i>. There were also cunning Women, who making themselves dead
Drunk with <i>Chica</i>, with which they mix’d the Herb <i>Viloa</i>, and afterwards coming to
themselves again, answer’d all the Questions that were proposed to them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their monthly Feasts.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Peruvians</i> kept two sorts of Feasts, the first at certain times, the others on
special occasions; the set-Feasts were kept Monethly; on the first Moneth <i>Rayme</i>,
agreeing with our last Moneth <i>December</i>, as aforesaid, they kept the great Feast <i>Capacrayme</i>,
on which they brought Multitudes of Sheep and Lambs for Burnt-offerings,
besides Silver and Gold. Not far from the Fire stood three Carv’d Images of
the Sun, and three others representing Thunder; and this was generally the Day
of the Installation of the young <i>Inga</i>’s, which was after this manner: The chief
Priest boring a Hole through his Ear, cover’d the upper part of his Body with the
holy Cloth <i>Guaras</i>, whilest the inferior Priests whipt him with knotted Cords, and
painted his Face with the Blood. During these Ceremonies no Stranger was suffer’d
to remain in <i>Cusco</i>, but after the Feast was ended they all return’d, and as before,
receiv’d Cakes bak’d of <i>Maiz</i> and Blood, as a testimony that they lov’d and
honor’d the <i>Inga</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Harvest Ceremonies.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Feast <i>Ytri</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The three Images of the Sun before-mention’d they call’d <i>Apointi</i>, <i>Churiunti</i>, and
<i>Intiquaoqui</i>, that is, <i>Father-Sun</i>, <i>Son-Sun</i>, and <i>Brother-Sun</i>. In like manner they nam’d
the three Images of Thunder, <i>Chuquilla</i>, <i>Catuilla</i>, and <i>Intillapa</i>; from which <i>Acosta</i>
judges that the Devil had obscurely taught the <i>Peruvians</i> the Mysteries of the holy
<i>Sacrament</i> and <i>Trinity</i>, (that their glory might be eclips’d by Idolatrous Errors) especially
the last, which seems plainly to be signifi’d by the <i>Peruvian</i> Deity <i>Tangatanga</i>,
whom they affirm’d to be One in Three, and Three in One. And that other Nations
also had a glimpse of the same may be collected from <i>Philip Cluverius</i>, who endeavors
to demonstrate, that the antient <i>Germans</i> and <i>Gauls</i> obscurely ador’d the <i>Trinity</i>
in the midst of their <i>Heathenism</i>, under the notion of <i>Sun</i>, <i>Moon</i>, and <i>Fire</i>, the Sun
signifying the <i>Father</i>, the Moon the <i>Son</i>, and the Fire the <i>Holy-Ghost</i>; to confirm
which he makes use of <i>Cæsar</i>’s Testimony, <i>viz.</i> <i>They onely esteem those Gods whom they
see, and those that assist them</i>, viz. <i>the</i> Sun, Vulcan, <i>and the</i> Moon; <i>for they have never
heard any thing concerning any other Gods</i>. <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> seems also to ascribe a
glimpse of this Mystery to the <i>Egyptians</i>, when he says, That the antientest People
in <i>Egypt</i>, when they view’d the World, and were amaz’d at all things on the
Earth, they judg’d that two Gods Govern’d them all, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i>, by whom
all things flourish’d and encreas’d; to whom they added a third, namely <i>Fire</i>, to
which they attributed a Divinity, as conducing much to the increase and growth of
all things. The <i>Moon</i>, which was also call’d <i>Juno</i>, they judg’d to be the Offspring
of God, (for Son and Daughter were promiscuously taken) who, according to
<i>Homer</i>, Marrying with <i>Jupiter</i>, brought forth <i>Vulcan</i>, which might haply be to them
a Type or Figure of the <i>Holy-Ghost</i>, proceeding from the <i>Father</i> and <i>Son</i>: <i>Vulcan</i>
was by her plac’d a President over the Fire, by which the <i>Heathens</i> seem’d to imitate
the fiery Power of the <i>Holy-Ghost</i>, purifying and cleansing all things: and this
cleansing Power was aim’d at by <i>Romulus</i>, when, according to <i>Dionysius Halicarnassensis</i>,
he commanded his Soldiers to leap through a Fire made before his Tent, that so
they might be purifi’d from all their Crimes. But it may be thought strange, that
the <i>Peruvians</i>, <i>Germans</i>, or <i>Egyptians</i>, lost in a Wood of gross Idolatry, could have any
apprehension, though never so obscure, of the holy <i>Trinity</i>, when as the most nice and
curious <i>Greek</i> and <i>Roman</i> Wits have made such gross mistakes concerning God. But
to return again to the <i>Peruvians</i>: They kept their second Feast in the second Moneth
<i>Camay</i>, on which they threw the Ashes of their Offerings into the River, and follow’d
them on the Shore for the space of five Leagues, praying the River to carry
the Ashes to the Sea, where <i>Viracocha</i> would receive them. In the third and fourth
Moneths they kill’d a hundred and ten black spotted and grey Sheep. In the beginning
of <i>May</i> (by the <i>Peruvians</i> call’d <i>Hatuncuzqui</i>) they gather’d in their <i>Maiz</i>, and
kept the Feast <i>Aymorai</i>; after which they return’d home Singing from their Fields,
call’d <i>Chacra</i>, and carried a great heap of <i>Maiz</i> with them, nam’d <i>Perua</i>, wrapping
it up in rich Garments; three Nights they continu’d their Ceremonies, imploring
the <i>Perua</i> to preserve their Harvest of <i>Maiz</i> from any damage that might chance
to come to it, and also to let that grow prosperously which they should Plant
next. Lastly, their Sorcerers consulted whether the <i>Perua</i> could last till the next
year? to which if they were answer’d <i>No</i>, they carried it into the Fields, and burning
it, made a new <i>Perua</i>, which when they knew to be sufficient to last good a year,
they carried it to the Granary in great triumph. In the seventh Moneth <i>Ancayacuzqui</i>,
they kept the Feast call’d <i>Intraymi</i>, with a hundred Sheep, in honor of the
Sun. They also made several Images of the Wood <i>Quimia</i>, which they put in rich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>Habits, strew’d the Ways with Flowers, Danc’d a strange Dance nam’d <i>Cayo</i>,
Singing several Songs. Persons of Quality put Golden Plates about their Knees,
as the common People painted them with divers Colours. In the eighth Moneth
<i>Chahua</i> they kept the high Feast <i>Huarqui</i>, on which they Offer’d a hundred grey
Sheep; the like number, but of a Chesnut colour, they Offer’d the following
Moneth <i>Yupaquis</i>, besides a thousand <i>Cuies</i>, that the Air, Water, or Sun, might not
spoil their Plants. Their Feast <i>Situa</i> they kept on the tenth Moneth <i>Coyaraymi</i> after
this manner: They gather’d all together on the first day before the Moon rose,
which no sooner appear’d, but they made a terrible noise, beat one another with
lighted Torches, then wash’d the Dirt from their Bodies, and made themselves
Drunk for four Days together. The eleventh Moneth <i>Armaraimi</i>, was nam’d <i>Punchaiquis</i>,
from the Feast they kept therein, on which (besides the usual Offerings of
eight hundred Sheep) they ty’d a black Sheep to a Post without Meat, till such
time as there fell store of Dew. Their Feast call’d <i>Raymicantara Raiquis</i>, was kept
in the last Moneth <i>Ayamara</i>, on which their Youth were bor’d through the Ears.
Amongst the high Feasts which were kept on great occasions, the chiefest was <i>Ytri</i>,
against which they all made new Clothes after a peculiar fashion, wearing their
Cloaks muffled about their Heads; in which manner they walked leisurely a whole
Day and a Night; during which time none durst either Eat or Drink, or open his
Eyes: But after this serious Processioning follow’d four days of extravagancy, as
Drinking, Dancing, and the like. In their Dances, which were to the sound of
Drums, Pipes, and Horns, they imitated all manner of Trades by strange motions
of their Bodies, besides divers other Frolicks and May-games which they us’d at
such times of Mirth and Festivity: But since the <i>Spaniards</i> conquer’d <i>Peru</i>, all these
<i>Heathenish</i> Customs have been laid aside.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Destruction of the old Empire of <i>Peru</i> foretold.</div>

<p class='c010'>As to the Prognostications and Fore-runners of the destruction of the old Empire
of <i>Peru</i>, it is reported, that <i>Guaynacava</i>, Father of the last King <i>Attabaliba</i>, lying on his
Death-bed in <i>Quito</i>, said to his Princes, <i>This Realm, at present rais’d to the highest top of
Eminency, is hastning towards its Ruine; and though our Kingdom remain as yet free from
foreign Invasion, the Countreys round about are already conquer’d and in Slavery: The Gods
have call’d strange People from unknown Regions, who by degrees will reach us also. With me,
who am the twelfth</i> Inga, <i>dies the Dominion of the mighty</i> Peru. <i>A People of other Fashions
and Religion will subvert our Religion, Laws and Government, and bring us under subjection
to them.</i> There were also Signs and Prodigies that portended the Dissolution of this
Empire; amongst the rest a great Eruption in the Province of <i>Tacinga</i>, which rending
the Earth asunder vomited up Flames of Fire; nor was it long e’re they were fulfill’d,
for whilest the <i>Peruvians</i> were making of Offerings to <i>Viracocha</i> for the delivery
of their imprison’d King <i>Huascar</i>, News was brought to <i>Cusco</i> of <i>Attabaliba</i>’s being taken;
the Particulars whereof, with other Matters touching the Conquest of this Kingdom
by the <i>Spaniards</i>, and how they pillag’d the Countrey, murder’d the Inhabitants,
and enrich’d themselves with their inestimable Treasures, shall in order be

<p class='c010'>The first that gave the <i>Spaniards</i> notice of <i>Peru</i>, was an <i>Indian</i> Prince call’d <i>Panguinaco</i>,
who having been taken Prisoner, inform’d <i>Vasquez Nunnez</i> of the abundance
or Gold and Silver which was to be had there, who resolv’d to venture through a
thousand Dangers into the South Sea. After which <i>Francisco Pizarro</i>, <i>Ferdinand de Lugue</i>,
and <i>Diego de Almagro</i>, consulted upon this great Design, <i>Anno 1525.</i> <i>Pizarrus</i> being
order’d to Sail before with a Ship carrying a hundred and fourteen Men, and <i>Almagro</i>
to follow with a Vessel carrying seventy Men, whilest <i>De Lugue</i> staid to manage
the Affairs at home. Fifty Leagues Southward from <i>Panama</i>, <i>Pizarrus</i> found a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>small Neck of Land nam’d <i>Peru</i>, from which it is most probable that great Kingdom
afterwards receiv’d its Denomination, though many deduce it from the River
<i>Beru</i>, as before mention’d: Thence Sailing to the main Continent of <i>Peru</i>, and
Landing, he lost several of his Men, and being himself desperately wounded, return’d
with ill success, whilest <i>Almagro</i> missing of him, Landed afterwards in the
same place, and also lost several of his Men, and one of his own Eyes: yet not
long after they renew’d their Design, carrying with them in two Ships and three
Boats, three hundred stout Men, which all suffer’d extream Hunger, and had they
not happily gotten some Sea-Crabs, they had without doubt all of them perish’d:
at last Landing on the Coast of <i>Catamez</i>, they were Encountred by a People whose
Faces were hung full of Golden Nails, and daily lost more and more of their Men;
upon which ill Successes the new <i>American</i> Vice-Roy forbad the farther discovery of
<i>Peru</i>, and call’d home the remaining part from the Island <i>Gallo</i>, so that <i>Pizarro</i> kept
with him but twelve Men, with whom he went to the desolate Isle <i>Gorgona</i>, where
he liv’d on Sea-Snails, till he receiv’d Provisions from <i>Panama</i>; after which they
spent two years in making farther Discoveries upon the Coasts of <i>Peru</i>: During
which time he visited the Queen <i>Capullana</i>, and discover’d a mighty Palace, where
three of the twelve Men were kill’d, whose Memory deserves to live for ever, because
the World owes to their unheard-of Valor the Discovery of the mighty Kingdom
of <i>Peru</i>; but there are onely left Recorded the Names of those nine Worthies
who surviv’d that Exploit, which were these following, <i>Nicholas de Rivera</i>, <i>Peter de
Candia</i>, <i>Juan Torre</i>, <i>Alonzo Briseni</i>, <i>Christophero Peralca</i>, <i>Alonzo de Truxillo</i>, <i>Francisco Cuellar</i>,
<i>Alonzo Molina</i>, and the Pilot <i>Bartholomeo Ruyz</i>: With these nine <i>Pizarro</i> Landed
on the Isle <i>Puna</i>, inhabited by a valiant People, who us’d Bowes, Darts, Silver
Knives, and Pikes tipt with Gold: From thence he steer’d his Course unto the
Haven <i>Tumbez</i>, where <i>Peter de Candia</i> Landing, was met by forty thousand of the Inhabitants,
who conducted him to the Temple of the Sun, built by the <i>Inga Guaynacava</i>,
and adorn’d in the in-side with Golden Plates. Not long after which <i>Pizarro</i>
was by an Order from the <i>Spanish</i> Court made Governor of <i>Peru</i>, to the great
discontent of <i>Almagro</i>; which Difference being decided, <i>Pizarro</i> set out again with
two hundred and fifty Foot, besides Horse, with which he Landed a hundred
Leagues lower than before, where he got a great Mass of Gold and some Emeraulds
of the <i>Casique</i>, all which he sent to <i>Panama</i>, thereby to stir up the People to come to
<i>Peru</i> to his assistance; where those that were at present on the Place, besides other
great Hardships which they suffer’d, were miserably plagued with Ulcers in their
Faces; yet they prosecuted their Conquest as well as they could with what small
Power was left them, and had newly taken <i>Puerto Viejo</i> when Captain <i>Bevalcazar</i>
and <i>Juan Florez</i> brought fresh Supplies of Men and Horse; with which Recruit
<i>Pizarro</i> conquer’d the Valley of <i>Tumbez</i>; from whence they Sail’d over to the Island
<i>Punas</i>, where the friendly Entertainment they met with at first, turn’d soon after into
a bloody Battel: for the <i>Spaniards</i> not forbearing to prie into every House, and
committing many Outrages, were set upon by the Natives, whom having at last
subdu’d, and being again supply’d with new Forces by <i>Ferdinando Sotto</i> from <i>Nicaragua</i>,
they return’d to <i>Tumbez</i>, where the Countrey was all in Arms upon the Report
of the <i>Spaniards</i> Cruelties committed on the Island <i>Puna</i>, insomuch that they Offer’d
all those whom they took alive to their Gods, and slew as many as they could conveniently
meet with. <i>Pizarro</i> having stay’d about twenty days, went with his Brothers
<i>Juan</i> and <i>Gonsalves</i>, the Captains <i>Sotto</i> and <i>Bevalcazar</i>, and fifty Horse over the
River <i>Ambato</i> about Mid-night, through a thorny Way betwixt Mountains, and
about Break-of-day fell upon the <i>Tumbezan</i> Army, and having setled things pretty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>well in those Parts, he built the City <i>St. Michael</i> in the Countrey <i>Tangazara</i>, along
the River <i>De la Chira</i>, where he was Complemented by two Agents from <i>Cusco</i>, who
desiring Aid in <i>Huascar</i>’s Name against his Brother <i>Attabaliba</i>, receiv’d for Answer,
That he was going to <i>Caxamalca</i>, as indeed he was, to find <i>Attabaliba</i> there; whose
Commands that he should not approach prov’d all in vain: for <i>Pizarro</i>, under
pretence of Complementing him in his Catholick Majesty’s Name, was no sooner
admitted to his Presence, but he took him Prisoner, and set for a Ransom upon
him as much Gold as a Room of fifty four Foot long and nine Foot broad was
able to contain, as high as he could just reach with his Hand held up: But the
Gold coming slower than was expected, <i>Pizarro</i> was much incens’d thereat, whom
<i>Attabaliba</i> endeavoring to pacifie, alledg’d, That it could not possibly come sooner,
because the Way between <i>Caxamalca</i> and <i>Cusco</i>, from whence the Gold was to be
fetch’d, was at a great distance: The truth whereof <i>Pizarro</i> resolving to try, sent
<i>Sotto</i> and <i>Peter del Baro</i> to <i>Cusco</i> in Chairs, carried by <i>Peruvians</i> exceeding swift of
Foot, and who if they tir’d were successively reliev’d by others that attended, without
so much as setting down the Chair; being got about half way, they met
with <i>Attabaliba</i>’s Captain <i>Cilucuchuma</i>, he having taken <i>Huascar</i> Prisoner, who requested
<i>Sotto</i> and <i>Baro</i> that they would be pleas’d to deliver him out of the Hands
of his blood-thirsty Brother, for which kindness he would pay three times as
much Gold as <i>Attabaliba</i> had promis’d, who was not able to give any thing else but
the Golden Plates which were in the Temple of the Sun in <i>Cusco</i>; whereas <i>Huascar</i>
had all the Treasure that was left by <i>Guaynacava</i>; which indeed was true, for <i>Huascar</i>
had caus’d it privately to be buried, and put to death those that did it, that so
he might keep the place conceal’d where it lay; insomuch that none could ever
find it out to this day, though the <i>Spaniards</i> have tortur’d the <i>Indians</i> with all imaginable
cruelty, to make them discover the place. But <i>Attabaliba</i> inform’d by <i>Pizarro</i>
of <i>Huascar</i>’s Imprisonment, seem’d to be exceeding sorry, and said, <i>I am much
troubled at the News of my Captain’s laying violent Hands on my Brother</i> Huascar, <i>whom I acknowledge
my eldest Brother, and both of the same Father and Mother; but I suppose  he has no
design to kill him, but onely keeps him Prisoner, to bring him to grant me peaceably to enjoy the
Kingdom of</i> Quito, <i>of late brought under subjection of the</i> Peruvian <i>Crown</i>. <i>Pizarro</i> not
observing <i>Attabaliba</i>’s subtilty (who design’d nothing but <i>Huascar</i>’s Death, out of
fear that the <i>Spaniards</i> upon his liberal promises to them, might promote him to
the Throne) comforted him as well as he could: whereupon <i>Attabaliba</i> supposing
that <i>Pizarro</i> would be little concern’d at the killing of his Brother <i>Huascar</i>, gave
speedy Order that he should be burnt alive, which accordingly was put into execution;
but before he was brought to the Fire, he foretold his Brother <i>Attabaliba</i>’s
cruel death. During which time <i>Almagro</i> came with fresh Supplies from <i>Panama</i>,
eager to have a share of the fore-mention’d Ransom, which at last was paid with
overplus; for by daily bringing in of Baskets of Gold, the Chamber was fill’d up to
the very top; but though <i>Attabaliba</i> had more than perform’d his Promise, yet Sentence
of Death was pronounc’d against him presently after he had been Baptiz’d:
the Reasons of which wicked and rash Condemnation were two; first the false Accusation
of a <i>Peruvian</i> Interpreter call’d <i>Philippillo</i>, who desir’d his Death, that then
he might with the more freedom enjoy one of his Wives; for <i>Attabaliba</i> mistrusting
the same, had complain’d thereof to <i>Pizarro</i>, saying, <i>That his Imprisonment was not
so grievous to him, as the thoughts of the Adultery, acted against the strict Laws of his Countrey</i>;
the Defiler of an <i>Inga</i>’s Bed being not onely to be burnt with the Adulterers,
but also the whole Families of them, to the least Infant, their Houses to be rac’d
to the Ground, and their Land sow’n with Salt, as for ever curs’d. The second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>cause of <i>Attabaliba</i>’s Death is laid on <i>Almagro</i>, who came to <i>Peru</i> with new Forces,
and who fearing that none of the Gold which <i>Attabaliba</i> had the delivery of, would
fall to his share, as not having been in the Battel where <i>Attabaliba</i> was taken, therefore
order’d him to be suddenly Strangled, that so the Booty might be equally divided.
Not long after <i>Pizarro</i> conquering <i>Cusco</i>, got no less Treasure than at <i>Caxamalca</i>.
Here the Reign of the <i>Peruvian Inga</i>’s ceased, with which before no Kings that
ever Govern’d in the World were able to compare in Riches and Glory. Their
Palaces were round about adorn’d with Golden Images; and they never ate but
out of Golden Vessels, spitting in the Hands of beautiful young Women of Noble
Extract, were worshipp’d like Gods both whilest living and when dead, all their
Subjects being their Slaves, and they the sole Lords of the whole Realm. In the
interim <i>Bevalcazar</i> march’d from the new City <i>St. Michael</i>, with a hundred and
twenty Foot and eighty Horse, to assist the <i>Cannares</i> against one of <i>Attabaliba</i>’s
Generals, who having spoil’d the Ways by digging Pits, and covering them over
with Bushes, resisted them in several places: then marching to <i>Quito</i> he burnt the
City, after having kill’d a hundred of the Natives, because they laughed at the <i>Spaniards</i>
Arrival. Afterwards joyning with <i>Almagro</i>, he went back to <i>Cusco</i>, whither
on the Way he had News of <i>Quisquis</i>, <i>Attabaliba</i>’s General, and of his Brother <i>Guaypalcon</i>,
who making use of a Rock, threw down great Stones, by the <i>Peruvians</i> call’d
<i>Galgas</i>, which in their Fall hitting others, brought down a great number with them,
by which means he not onely defended the Place for the present, but kill’d fourteen
<i>Spaniards</i>; nevertheless distrusting his ability to keep it, he retreated to a steep
Mountain about Midnight, at the Foot whereof a Passage led over a deep River,
where he burnt all his Luggage that he could not carry with him; also above fifteen
thousand Sheep and four thousand Prisoners, became wholly at the Discretion of
<i>Almagro</i>, who leaving there Captain <i>Martin Astete</i>, order’d him to build the Town
<i>Truxillo</i>: In the mean time <i>Quisquis</i> was put to flight by <i>Pizarro</i>, and went to <i>Quito</i>,
where he lost many People, that were kill’d by <i>Bevalcazar</i>’s Guard; yet those that
were remaining chose rather to Fight to the last, than flye through Wildernesses,
and there be starv’d to death; which <i>Quisquis</i> contradicting, was Stabb’d by his
Captain <i>Guappalau</i>, and immediately after cut to pieces. As soon as these Stirs
were quieted, <i>Pizarro</i> began to build the City <i>Los Reyos</i>, near a convenient Haven
of the Southern Ocean, whilest <i>Almagro</i> marching to <i>Chili</i> with two Troops of
Horse, and five hundred Foot, return’d without doing any thing remarkable, except
his taking the Interpreter <i>Philippillo</i>, (whom he caus’d to be cut into four pieces)
and his maintaining several Battels against the <i>Chileses</i>, clad in Sea-Wolves Skins.
In this Journey he lost several of his Men on the Snowy Mountains. About this
time a Ship fitted out by <i>Gabriel Carvajal</i>, Bishop of <i>Placentia</i>, Sailing through the
<i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>, ran into the Haven <i>Los Reyos</i>, out of which the first Rats swam
ashore that ever were in <i>Peru</i>, by which the Countrey since suffering much damage,
the Inhabitants call’d them <i>Ococha</i>, that is, <i>Sinful Creatures</i>. Now all things on the
<i>Spaniards</i> side were tending to a quiet possession, when a new Accident arose, which
had like to have spoil’d all, for <i>Mango Inga</i>, <i>Attabaliba</i>’s Brother, being releas’d out
of Prison by <i>Juan Pizarro</i>, obtain’d leave to go to <i>Yucaya</i>, to fetch the famous Golden
Image <i>Machys</i>, representing his Father <i>Guaynacava</i>: but he having now gotten his
Liberty slew all the <i>Spaniards</i> which work’d in the Gold-Mines, took the Castle of
<i>Cusco</i> by Storm, as also the City, after a Siege of eight Moneths; which nevertheless
was by <i>Francisco Pizarro</i> soon re-taken, and <i>Mango</i> forc’d to flye into the Mountains
<i>Andes</i>, after he had kill’d several of <i>Almagro</i>’s Men; soon after <i>Almagro</i> about
Midnight getting over the Walls, and taking <i>Ferdinando</i> and <i>Gonsalvo Pizarro</i>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span><i>Alphonso Alvarado</i> Prisoners, condemn’d them all three to die, caus’d himself to be
proclaim’d Governor, and gave the Royal Tassel to <i>Paulo Inga</i>, whilest <i>Gonsalvo</i> and
<i>Alvarado</i> breaking Prison, inform’d <i>Francisco Pizarro</i> thereof (who then had obtain’d
the Title of <i>Marquess</i>, and for an Inheritance, the Province <i>Attabillos</i>;) he was
exceedingly troubled for his Brother <i>Ferdinand</i>, whose Enlargement he thought
would be best procur’d by making Peace with <i>Almagro</i> and the sooner, because the
<i>Peruvians</i> began to rebel against the <i>Spaniards</i> in most places, slew divers Companies
of them; amongst whom <i>Diego Pizarro</i> was set upon in a narrow Path call’d <i>Laucesta
Parcos</i>, and amongst the Mountains lost seventy Horsemen; and <i>Gonsalvo de
Tapico</i> sav’d not one of eighty Horse. Also the <i>Peruvians</i> set upon three hundred
Troopers, Commanded by the Generals of the Horse, <i>Morgoveio</i> and <i>Gaeti</i>, in a narrow
Path, and rowl’d down great Stones from the tops of the Mountains both before
and behind them, so killing both Horse and Man before they could put themselves
into a posture of Defence, insomuch that none escap’d with Life but two
Troopers. <i>Francisco de Godoy</i>, sent out of <i>Los Reyos</i> with forty five Horse, upon
Discoveries, return’d also with great loss, being pursu’d twenty Leagues by the <i>Peruvians</i>;
against whom <i>Peter de Lerma</i> being sent out with sixty Horse, fought a whole
day with them, and though few of his Men were kill’d, yet many were wounded,
and several taken: The victorious <i>Peruvians</i> retreating to the top of a sandy Mountain
in the Night, Offer’d the <i>Spaniards</i> they had taken Prisoners, as a testimony of
thanks, to <i>Viracocha</i>, and afterwards stood drawn up near the City <i>Los Reyos</i> by the
General <i>Tyzopangui</i>. The Marquess thus beset round, sent for Aid from <i>New Spain</i>
and <i>Truxillo</i>, and also for <i>Alphonso Alvarado</i> to come back, who had been sent to
discover the Countrey <i>Chachepoyos</i>, and being gotten into a Desart, would without
doubt have perish’d for want of Water, had not some Horsemen riding somewhat
out of the Way, found Pits with fresh Water: notwithstanding which, five hundred
<i>Inacona</i>’s (for so the <i>Spaniards</i> call’d the <i>Peruvian</i> Slaves) died for Thirst. He was
afterwards supply’d by <i>Gomez Tordoya</i> with two hundred Men, by the help of
whom, though encompass’d by the Inhabitants near the Bridge <i>Lamucacha</i>, where
began a fierce Battel, <i>Alvarado</i> was in the end Conqueror.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whilest the <i>Spaniards</i> found so much to do with the <i>Peruvians</i>, yet they could not
forbear more and more Clashing amongst themselves, the Marquess commanding
that <i>Almagro</i> should surrender and leave the City <i>Cusco</i>; but he refusing to obey,
fortifi’d himself on the top of the Mountain <i>Gaytara</i>, stopt the Ways by cutting
down the Trees: but <i>Ferdinando Pizarro</i> getting up to the top along a private Way,
made such a confusion amongst them with Bolt-shot, that <i>Almagro</i>, who was sick
at that time, was forc’d to flye; which being told <i>Pizarro</i>, he pursu’d him, and had
doubtless utterly defeated him at that bout, had not his Men, benumm’d with
marching in the deep Snow, been taken with a Distemper which made them as if
they had been all Sea-sick, (for such is the property of the Mountain <i>Guaytara</i>) insomuch
that they could scarce carry their Arms: Whereupon <i>Almagro</i> was advis’d
to oppose his Pursuers, and that he need not doubt of the Victory; but he either
following his own Dictates, or being counter-advis’d, fortifi’d himself in <i>Cusco</i>,
whither <i>Ferdinand</i> and <i>Gonsalvo Pizarro</i> march’d against him. <i>Rodrigo de Orgonnes</i>
Commanded <i>Almagro</i>’s Army, who being sick, lay on the Walls of the City to see
the Battel fought. The <i>Peruvians</i>, who on each side were in the <i>Spanish</i> Service,
march’d in the Front: on the twenty sixth of <i>April, Anno 1538.</i> the Fight began, in
which the <i>Almagrians</i> did much mischief with Cross-bar shot amongst the <i>Pizarrians</i>;
yet <i>Almagro</i>’s Horse retreated first, being under the Command of <i>Peter Valdivia</i>;
soon after which the rest of his Army, their Courage also failing, fled to the City;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>into which, as soon as <i>Orgones</i> being shot in the Head and slain, the Conqueror
rush’d after them, and took <i>Almagro</i> Prisoner: yet notwithstanding this prosperous beginning,
he soon found himself in a great strait, since those which remain’d alive of
<i>Almagro</i>’s Party refus’d to serve <i>Pizarro</i>, and murmur’d against him in all places,
resolving to take <i>Almagro</i> from him by force, besides that <i>Pizarro</i>’s Soldiers grumbled
that they were not paid sufficiently for the many hazards which they had run:
wherefore to compose these Troubles as well as possibly he could, he banish’d all
whom he thought to be of the opposite Party, sent away the chief of his own mutinous
Soldiers with Captain <i>Peter de Candia</i>, to discover new Countreys, put <i>Almagro</i>
to death, and march’d to <i>Callao</i>; where being straitned for want of Provision,
he made no stay, but got his Army with much ado to <i>Cusco</i>. <i>Gonsalves Pizarro</i> was
likewise so set upon by the Natives, that he lost a considerable number of Men:
In short, the <i>Pizarrans</i> were defeated in all places, and at length the Marquess,
though forewarn’d by his Secretary <i>Antonio Picado</i>, was murder’d in his own House
in the City of <i>Lima</i>, otherwise call’d <i>De los Reyos</i>, by a Bastard-Son of <i>Almagro</i>, nam’d
<i>Diego</i>, in the Year 1541; his Body dragg’d to the Church-yard, lay there to every
ones view and derision, till <i>John de Barbara</i> buried the same. His Father <i>Gonsalvo
Pizarro</i>, sir-nam’d <i>The tall Citizen of Truxillo</i>, Commanding a Company of Foot in
<i>Navarre</i>, had two lawful Sons, <i>viz.</i> <i>Ferdinand</i>, who was murder’d in the <i>Spanish</i>
Castle <i>Motta</i>, and <i>John</i> that was slain in <i>Cusco</i>, when <i>Mango Inga</i> conquer’d the City,
the other two, <i>Gonsalvo</i> and <i>Francisco</i>, being both Bastards; the last of which is
said to have been expos’d by his Mother in the Church Porch, and kept alive for
several days by sucking of a Sow, till his Father afore-mention’d finding him, and
acknowledging him for his Son, put him out to Nurse, and when he was grown
up set him to keep Swine; which course of Life he soon left, and following <i>Alphonsus
de Ojeda</i>, <i>Balboa</i>, and <i>Pedro de Avita</i> in their Expeditions, he quickly grew rich,
and at last came to that heighth of Honor and Command we have heard. <i>Francisco
Martino de Alcantara</i> was also his Brother by the Mothers side onely. He was a Man
who despis’d all Dangers and Hardships, was so well experienc’d in Martial Affairs,
that he might well stand in competition with many of the antient Heroes.
In <i>Los Reyos</i> he built two very artificial Water-Mills, a <i>Dominican</i> Cloyster, and another
for the Monks <i>De la Merced</i>, and likewise a stately Palace for himself: He
was both meek and affable; and though he bore the greatest Command in the Emperor’s
Name over the mighty Kingdom of <i>Peru</i>, and got more Riches than ever
any of the <i>Roman</i>, <i>Persian</i>, <i>Grecian</i>, or <i>Assyrian</i> Monarchs possess’d, yet he went in the
same plain kind of Apparel in the heighth of his Grandeur, as when he was but in a
low Condition; about his Neck he commonly ty’d a Linnen Hankerchiff, with which
he us’d to wipe the Sweat from his Face: in peaceable Intervals he spent whole
days in playing at Bowls, without any distinction of Persons, chusing often to play
rather with a Sea-man or common Soldier, than a phantastick Gallant: He visited
the meanest Citizens, and many times us’d to eat with poor People, to whom he
was upon all occasions very noble and liberal; All his Designs he carried on by
the strength of meer natural Parts: for he was so very illiterate, that he could neither
Write nor Read; his Edicts were Sign’d with his two Marks, betwixt which
his Secretary writ <i>Francisco Pizarro</i>; he is said to have had a Son which died young
by <i>Attabaliba</i>’s Sister, who came afterwards to be call’d <i>Donna Angelina</i>; he died in
a very unfortunate time, for upon his good success the <i>Spanish</i> Power had grounded
their whole Designs, thinking with the  <i>Peruvian</i> Treasures, as the Sinews of War, to
have erected a fifth Monarchy to succeed the fourth of the <i>Romans</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Almagro</i> utterly defeated by <i>Vacca de Castro</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Deliver’d up Prisoner by <i>Salazar</i>, and Beheaded.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Pizarro</i>’s Murderer, though aiming at the Supream Power, he had a considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>Party to countenance and aid him, yet he found resistance in many places, not without
the loss of many Men on both sides. In which Juncture the Learned <i>Vacca de
Castro</i> Landed in <i>Peru</i>, with a Commission from the Emperor to settle the divided
Kingdom of <i>Peru</i> in Peace and Quiet; but the young <i>Almagro</i> mad to see
his Ambition thus cross’d, gave Battel to <i>Castro</i> in the Plain of <i>Chupas</i>; the Dispute
was long and resolute on both sides, and the Night coming on made the Fight the
more terrible, in which the Victory inclin’d to <i>Castro</i>; however the <i>Almagrians</i> stood
to it stoutly for a great while, and that chiefly through the valor of the Captains
<i>Balboa</i> and <i>Christopher Losa</i>, who breaking in amongst the <i>Castreans</i>, hack’d and hew’d
down all they came near, till at last they were forc’d to betake themselves to flight,
and had not many of them exchang’d their white Scarfs with the red of the slain
<i>Castreans</i>, scarce any of them had escap’d from being kill’d in the pursuit, and most
of them that did escape were slain the next Morning by the <i>Peruvians. Rodrigo Salazar,
Almagro</i>’s Deputy, deliver’d up his Lord to <i>Castro</i>, who condemn’d him to death,
whereupon he was immediately Beheaded with a Sword. This Battel hapned on
the twenty sixth of <i>September Anno 1542</i>. when it Froze so hard the following Night,
that most of those that were left wounded upon the place, were frozen to death.
Thus <i>Castro</i> began his Government with Blood, and made it his first Business to
make a Discovery by several of his Captains, whom he sent for that purpose, of the
Countreys lying Eastward from <i>Peru</i>, lying upon the great River <i>De la Plata</i>, and
the River <i>Marannon</i>, where in most places they met onely with salvage People, and
for the most part Man-eaters; and in one place where they Landed, a great Fish resembling
a Dog came ashore and kill’d several Arm’d Soldiers. A year and a half
<i>Castro</i> had liv’d in <i>Cusco</i>, when at the arrival of the Vice-Roy <i>Blascus Nunnez Vela</i>,
all things were turn’d topsie-turvy, he being sent thither by the Emperor <i>Charles</i> the
Fifth, accompanied by four Councellors, <i>Diego Sepada</i>, <i>Lison Tejada</i>, <i>Juan Alvarez</i>,
and <i>Peter Ortiz</i>, to curb the <i>Spaniards</i> Villanies and Outrages committed against the
<i>Peruvians</i>, entred <i>Tumbez, Anno 1544</i>. where he immediately publish’d the Emperor’s
Edicts, which were to this effect:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Emperor’s Proclamation in behalf of the <i>Indians</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>All</i> Peruvians <i>are to be releas’d from Slavery; no</i> Spaniard <i>shall the least oppress them,
nor make use of their Service without rewarding them for the same, nor take any Provisions of
them without paying for it</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ill resented by the <i>Spaniards</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Pizarro</i> marches against the Vice-Roy <i>Vela</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Vela</i> clashing with the Commissioners, is seiz’d upon.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Being Shipt for <i>Spain</i>, is brought back by <i>Alvaradez</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Is put to flight and pursu’d by <i>Pizarro</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Vice-Roy slain by <i>Carvayales</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Pizarro</i>’s Luxury, and Tyranny.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Vela Nunnez</i> and <i>La Torre</i> Plotting against <i>Pizarro</i>, are taken and Executed.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Proclamation was like to put the <i>Spaniards</i> into an uproar: for at that
time a <i>Peruvian</i> Lord was forc’d to allow every Foot-Soldier three Slaves, and a
Horseman five, besides Hens, Rabbets, Eggs, the Wine <i>Azun</i>, and other Provisions,
for nothing. The general Complaints were, <i>Is this the Reward for our Service which
we have shewn to the Emperor? Is not this mighty Kingdom of</i> Peru <i>by our Blood and Labor
joyn’d to the Imperial Crown? Our Shoulders are grown sore under our Arms, our Bodies made
useless with Wounds, and our Limbs lame’d with Bruises. Who shall maintain our Wives and
Children, if the</i> Peruvians, <i>who according to the Law of Arms are become our Slaves, should
not be forc’d to fish for Pearls in the Sea, and dig us Silver out of the Mines, and do us other
Service for to maintain us?</i> But <i>Vela</i> being deaf to these Complaints, resolv’d that the
Emperor’s Commands should be fulfill’d, and that those that spake against them
should lose their Lives: and that he might terrifie the generality with the punishment
of a few, he caus’d Fryer <i>Peter</i> of the Order of the Virgin <i>Mary</i> to be Executed
in <i>Truxillo, Castro</i> to be committed to Prison at <i>Lima</i>, because he had put <i>Almagro</i>
to death without Examination, and shut the Gates of <i>Cusco</i> when his Agent came
before the same. But do what he could, the <i>Spaniards</i> generally making Head, utterly
refus’d to obey the Emperor’s Edicts, and chose <i>Gonsalvo Pizarro</i> for their
General, who rais’d five hundred Men in compleat Arms in <i>Cusco</i>, from whence he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>march’d directly with them to <i>Los Reyos</i>, under pretence to deliver a Petition
there to the Vice-Roy’s Council, about deferring to put the new Edicts in force
till the Emperor was better inform’d of the present Condition of the <i>Peruvian</i> State;
twenty great Field-pieces being also order’d to follow <i>Pizarro</i>’s Army, were carried
by the <i>Peruvians</i> over craggy Mountains; to each Gun without the Carriage
were order’d three hundred Men, of whom twelve at a time carried it in their
turns a hundred Paces a piece; though several eminent Persons considering the
weightiness of the Affair, forsook <i>Pizarro</i>’s Party, and went privately to the Vice-Roy,
as on the other side, many deserting the Vice-Roy joyn’d with <i>Pizarro</i>, who
being not a little supply’d by <i>Peter Puelles</i> Governor of <i>Guanaca</i>, took several of those
that had deserted him Prisoners, and put them all to death, whilest the Vice-Roy
made what Preparations possibly he could, Hanging many innocent Persons onely
on suspicion of holding Correspondency with <i>Pizarro</i>, insomuch that there was no
end of Murdering on both sides. But <i>Vela</i> clashing with his Councellors, because
they would not consent that he should ruine <i>Los Reyos</i>, resolv’d to do it without
them; and to that end to remove the Emperor’s Seal, Staple of Trade, and Courts
Judicature to <i>Truxillo</i>, and to spoil the Countrey all about; which as he was
about to put in Execution, they privately got Captain <i>Martin Robles</i>, and <i>Vela</i>’s
Lifeguard, consisting of a hundred Men, on their side, whilest the common People
mutinying broke into the Palace, took <i>Vela</i> and carried him to the chief Church
in <i>Los Reyos</i>, where the four Councellors were assembled, who order’d that the Prisoner
should be Shipt and sent away to <i>Spain</i>, when <i>Alvares Cueto</i> lying in the Harbor
with ten Sail, threatned to fall upon the Inhabitants if they would not release
the Vice-Roy: whereupon the Councellors well provided with Guns, rais’d several
Batteries against his Ships, so that <i>Cueto</i> finding himself too weak, set four
of his Vessels on fire, and Sail’d with the rest to the Haven <i>Guavara</i>; where being
set upon by <i>Diego Garzias</i>, he was forc’d to deliver the remaining part of his Fleet
up to the Councellors, who sent <i>Vela</i> away with the same, under the Command of
<i>Didaco Alvaradez</i>. But <i>Pizarro</i>, who till this time had pretended that he sought
nothing else but <i>Vela</i>’s Departure, march’d close to the Walls of <i>Los Reyos</i> with
twelve hundred Men, Hang’d three Citizens upon a Tree, requir’d the Councellors
to grant him Letters Patents, by which he might be acknowledg’d for the Supream
Governor of <i>Peru</i>, which if they refus’d, he threatned to put all that were
in the City to the Sword; and upon Consultation it was judg’d convenient to
grant his Demands, the rather, because they had not above fifty fighting Men in
the City. Mean while <i>Didaco Alvaradez</i> making an Agreement with the Vice-Roy,
they return’d back with their Ships, and Landed in the Haven Mouth of the River
<i>Tumbez</i>, rais’d what Forces they could possibly thereabouts, but were forc’d to
retire from thence to <i>Quito</i>, (at the same time that the Councellor <i>Tejada</i>, being sent
by <i>Pizarro</i> to the Emperor, came to an Anchor there) where they were courteously
Entertain’d; as also in <i>St. Michael</i>, where they got daily more and more Assistants;
of which <i>Pizarro</i> being inform’d, went thither with five hundred Men,
and forcing the Vice-Roy to flye from thence, pursu’d him above thirty Leagues,
Hanging up all those whom he could take of his Party. After many Rencounters
and Hardships suffer’d by both Parties, <i>Pizarro</i> exceedingly wearied, return’d to
<i>Quito</i>, where he minded nothing but all manner of Debaucheries, not in the least
regarding the Vice-Roy’s Designs, which it concern’d him to have narrowly look’d
into, for he having got five hundred Men on his side, resolv’d to venture a Battel.
It was towards Evening when the two Parties had sight of one another: <i>Pizarro</i>
having not onely more Men, but also better Exercis’d in Arms than the Vice-Roy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>who being sensible thereof, went silently about Midnight from his Station along
a narrow by Path, so to fall behind upon the Rere of the Enemy, who mistrusted
nothing, by reason the Vice-Roy’s Dogs kept a continual Barking in his old Station,
and the <i>Peruvian</i> Sentinels were heard calling to one another, and making
great Fires all the Night long; but because the Way was over-grown, and farther
about than it was suppos’d, the Vice-Roy finding the Night too far spent, went
back to <i>Quito</i>, out of which he Sallied as soon as he had sight of <i>Pizarro</i>’s Forces;
against whom, being clad in a white Riding Coat, through the Slits of which appear’d
a Cloth of Tissue Doublet, he came Riding on a Bay Gelding in the Head of
his Party; with which breaking in amongst the Enemies Ranks, he made a considerable
slaughter amongst them, till <i>Hernand Tores</i> coming near him, gave him a Blow
on the Head with a Battel-Ax, that fell’d him to the Ground, which the Lawyer
<i>Carvayales</i> seeing, ran immediately, out of desire to revenge his Brother’s Death,
whom the Vice-Roy had murder’d, and chopp’d off his Head. Thus <i>Pizarro</i> being
absolute Master of the Field, began to shew his tyranny upon the Prisoners, some
he took away by Poyson, others he Executed with the Sword and Halter, others
he banish’d to the remote Countrey <i>Chili</i>, and spent his time in all manner of Vice
in <i>Quito</i>; where, amongst other leud Actions, making Love to another Man’s Wife,
he hir’d one <i>Vincent Paul</i> to murder her Husband, which said <i>Vincent</i> was afterwards
Hang’d at <i>Valladolid</i> in <i>Spain</i>. The Adulteress also was afterwards Got with Child
by her own Father, and both of them put to death for Incest and murdering of their
Child. <i>Pizarro</i> being receiv’d as King in <i>Los Reyos</i>, grew every day more proud
than other, insomuch that his Friends themselves began to hate and envy him, and
wanted onely a convenient opportunity to rid themselves of this high-minded Tyrant.
A strange Accident, among others, had done him great hurt, had it not been
timely discover’d, <i>viz.</i> <i>Joan de la Torre</i>, a Soldier formerly belonging to the Vice-Roy,
found accidentally a Grave in the Valley <i>Hica</i> (which by the <i>Peruvians</i> had
been worshipp’d above two Ages before) and in it so much Offer’d Gold and Silver
as amounted to above eighty thousand Crowns in Gold, besides many Emeraulds
and <i>Turcoises</i>, all which Treasure he was puzled how to carry away and possess
securely, partly fearing the Emperor’s Displeasure, if he should arrive thus
rich in <i>Spain</i>, the rather because he had sided with <i>Pizarro</i>, and also knowing it
was impossible to convey it on Ship-board without one or others knowledge; at
last, after many Contrivances, he judg’d it convenient to put the Money in a small
Vessel, and Sail with the same to <i>Nicaragua</i>, there to raise Men to oppose <i>Pizarro</i>
in those Parts, that so he might re-gain the Emperor’s Favor. This Undertaking
seem’d to be threatned by many Dangers, he not having a sufficient Spirit to Command,
or at least Experience to officiate the Place of a Captain. In the mean time
<i>Vela Nunnez</i>, Brother to the slain Vice-Roy, taken in the Battel at <i>Quito</i>, had so
much priviledge allow’d him from <i>Pizarro</i>, that he went a Hunting, and other such
Exercises, distant from the Camp, who meeting with <i>La Torre</i>, took him in his
arms, and embrac’d him with great joy, which so wrought upon <i>La Torre</i>, that he
discover’d the Secret of his discover’d Treasure, took an Oath of him that he would
be faithful to him, and take Revenge of <i>Pizarro</i> for all the Injuries receiv’d from him;
but before, according to their Agreement, they could set Sail from thence, their
Plot being discover’d, both <i>Nunnez</i> and <i>Torre</i> were Executed, and their Riches fell
into the Hands of <i>Pizarro</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Peter Gasca</i> sent to settle Affairs in <i>Peru</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Whilest the <i>Peruvian</i> Affairs were in this confusion and disorder, <i>Peter Gasca</i>, impower’d
by the Emperor <i>Charles</i> the Fifth, arriving there, endeavor’d to settle all
things in Peace and Quiet, and sent by <i>Peter Hernandes</i>, besides the Emperor’s Letter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>another which he writ himself to <i>Pizarro</i>, the Contents of which were to this
purpose:</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><i>Gasca</i>’s Letter to <i>Pizarro</i>.</div>

<p class='c018'><i>The</i> Peruvian <i>Soyl hath drunk up the</i> Spanish <i>Blood long enough, and the ruin’d Realm
gapes for Rest: The Emperor proffers Pardon for all past Crimes, Repeals the new
Laws which the Vice-Roy</i> Vela, <i>during his Government, enjoyn’d the</i> Spaniards <i>to observe.
If</i> Pizarro <i>aims at the general Welfare, he may easily see that Arms must first be laid aside,
which he now depends on in vain, all his Associates being ready to forsake him, because no Soldier
can take up Arms against the Emperor, without being guilty of high Treason</i>.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><i>Pizarro</i>’s Designs against him.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>His Party generally fall off to <i>Gasca</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cusco</i> taken by <i>Centeno</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Pizarro</i> confounded with this Letter, call’d a Council of War, who differ’d very
much from one another in their Votes, some judging that it would be best privately
to destroy <i>Gasca</i>, others were for an open Engagement, but most thought of
another way, <i>viz.</i> to get his Person into their custody, and keep him under a strong
Guard on the Island <i>Puna</i>, under pretence that the <i>Peruvian</i> Princes were sent for to
come and acknowledge him as supream Governor, which because the Cities lay so
remote one from another, could not be done in less than two years. Mean while
an Embassy was to be sent to the Court at <i>Madrid</i>, which should enjoyn <i>Gasca</i> to
remain in <i>Panama</i>, and not offer to come to <i>Peru</i> till such time as the Emperor
commanded the same a second time at the return of the Agents. But <i>Hieronimus
Loaisa</i>, chief Bishop of <i>Los Reyos</i>, <i>Thomas Martin</i>, Provincial of the <i>Dominicans</i>, <i>Gomes
Solis</i>, <i>Pizarro</i>’s Steward, <i>Laurence Aldana</i>, who were design’d for this Embassy to the
Emperor <i>Charles</i>, never went their Journey, but staid in <i>Panama</i> with <i>Gasca</i>, who
had also gain’d to his Party <i>Peter Alfonso Ainoiosa</i>, who Commanded <i>Pizarro</i>’s
Fleet: <i>Aldana</i> likewise inform’d him of all <i>Pizarro</i>’s private Councels; whereupon
<i>Gasca</i> sent privately for Aid to <i>Mexico</i>, <i>Guatimala</i>, <i>Nicaragua</i>, and <i>St. Domingo</i>,
and dispatch’d four Ships with three hundred Men, Commanded by <i>Aldana</i>, from
the Haven <i>Panama</i>, with Order to Land about Midnight against the City <i>Los Reyos</i>,
and so fall unawares on <i>Pizarro</i>. <i>Aldana</i> accordingly falling into the Bay of <i>Malabrige</i>,
was reliev’d and supply’d with Provisions by <i>Diego Mora</i>, Governor of <i>Truxillo</i>:
On the other side, the Field-Marshal <i>Carvayales</i> being sent for by <i>Pizarro</i>, made a
pompous Entrance, with the firing of Guns and Bonfires, into <i>Los Reyos</i>, where all
Persons that seem’d to have the least inclination for <i>Gasca</i>, were either stabb’d or
poyson’d. In the room of <i>Mora</i>, <i>Pizarro</i> sent the Lawyer <i>Garcias Leon</i> to be Governor
of <i>Truxillo</i>, but he being taken by <i>Aldana</i>’s Fleet, joyn’d with <i>Gasca</i>; and
thus all things began to conspire the ruine of <i>Pizarro</i>, yet he despair’d not, but being
inform’d of the approach of the Ships, caus’d the Drums to be beaten in <i>Los Reyos</i>,
forc’d every one that was able to bear Arms, on pain of death to serve him, made
several experienc’d Soldiers, Commanders over his Horse and Foot, to whom he
gave as much Money as they requir’d, to maintain those whom they had rais’d, and
who were to be rais’d, by which means he got a thousand Men in Arms; to which
number, according to an Order sent to <i>Cusco</i>, <i>Plata</i>, <i>Arequipa</i>, <i>Lima</i>, <i>Guanuco</i>, and
other neighboring Places, new Forces were expected to joyn; but <i>Savedra</i>, Governor
of <i>Guanuco</i>, deserting the City, left <i>Pizarro</i> and joyn’d with <i>Mora</i>, who secur’d
the Province of <i>Caxamalca</i> for <i>Gasca</i>. Thus <i>Pizarro</i> began to be daily more and
more forsaken. Since the destruction of the Vice-Roy <i>Vela</i>, Captain <i>Diego Centeni</i>
had hid himself out of fear of <i>Pizarro</i> a whole year, in a Cave under Ground, but
now inform’d of <i>Gasca</i>’s Arrival, came forth, and getting forty Men and some
Horses together, which also belong’d formerly to the Vice-Roy, resolv’d, though
meanly Arm’d, to go upon a bold Design, <i>viz.</i> to take the City <i>Cusco</i>; of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span><i>Antonio de Robles</i>, a Man hated and despis’d for his mean Extract and little Wit,
had the chief Command, there being therein a Garrison of five hundred Soldiers,
besides the Citizens, who were likewise in Arms: Being inform’d of <i>Centeno</i>’s approach,
he sent out <i>Francisco Aguierre</i> as a Spye to discover the Enemy; but he joyning
with <i>Centeno</i>, advis’d him to march along a By-way, and towards Night to draw up
about <i>Cusco</i>, which accordingly he did, and forcing open the Gates, rush’d in with
his Horse against the Enemy, who were drawn up in the Market-place, and breaking
through their Ranks trampled whole Companies under foot; after which he fell
in upon <i>Robles</i>, who having forgotten to give his Men the <i>Word</i>, caus’d a great distraction;
for the Men blinded by the darkness of the Night, knew not Friend from
Foe, insomuch that <i>Robles</i>’s Party did one another more mischief than <i>Centeno</i> did;
who being thus become Master of the City, caus’d <i>Robles</i> to be Beheaded the next
day, and distributed a hundred thousand <i>Ducats</i> amongst his Soldiers, and then
march’d with a hundred Men to the City <i>Plata</i>, to bring <i>Mendoza</i>, Governor of the
same, under the Emperor’s subjection; in which his Design he likewise prov’d successful,
being supply’d with a hundred and thirty Foot, which <i>Lucas Martin</i>, had
fetch’d from <i>Arequipa</i> for the Service of <i>Pizarro</i>, whom since he had deserted and
joyn’d with <i>Gasca</i>’s Party. Mean while the Fleet under the Command of <i>Aldana</i>
arriv’d in the Haven before <i>Los Reyos</i>, to the great terror and amazement of the
whole City; from whence <i>Pizarro</i> marching, Encamp’d himself with five hundred
and fifty Men, so to prevent their Landing, swearing that he would spare
none whoe’re fell into his Hands, and sent Order to <i>Peter Martin</i>, whom he had left
in the City, immediately to Hang up those which would not follow the Army, or
who return’d from thence home; to which purpose <i>Martin</i> went from place to place
with an Executioner, and thinking him not quick enough in his Work, stabb’d
many Citizens himself: And strict Order was given by <i>Pizarro</i> that all Runaways
should be punish’d with Death; notwithstanding all which many of his
nearest Friends daily forsook him, taking advantage of the darkness of the Night;
nay, the Soldiers themselves would at Noon-day ride away from him, crying
aloud, <i>Long live the Emperor, and let the Tyrant</i> Pizarro <i>die</i>: Wherefore he judg’d it
most convenient to remove to the Countrey <i>Nasca</i>: During his Journey thither,
whole Troops left him, insomuch that he scarce kept a hundred and fifty Men,
and those he fear’d every Minute would fall upon him and Murder him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Los Reyos</i> declares for the Emperor.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Pizarro</i> utterly defeated, surrenders himself into <i>Gasca</i>’s Power.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Carvayales</i> and <i>Pizarro</i> both put to death by <i>Gasca</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>With <i>Pizarro</i>’s departure, the whole Scene of Affairs was chang’d in <i>Los Reyos</i>;
for there the Imperial Standard was erected, the City Cryer read the Letters of
Pardon which <i>Gasca</i> had brought with him from <i>Spain</i> in the corner of every Street.
<i>Juan Palimino</i> Landing with fifty Men, receiv’d all those that had deserted <i>Pizarro</i>,
whilest <i>Gasca</i> set Sail from <i>Panama</i> with five hundred Men, with whom Landing at
<i>Truxillo</i>, he Encamp’d himself in the Valley <i>Xauxa</i>, whither great multitudes
flock’d from all places out of malice to <i>Pizarro</i>, who in a short time had destroy’d
above five hundred Gentlemen. But <i>Pizarro</i> having quitted <i>Los Reyos</i>, he possess’d
the City <i>Arequipa</i>, which he found quite desolate, but meeting afterwards with the
Forces Commanded by <i>Juan Acosta</i>, of which one half were also run away, joyn’d
with them, and march’d against <i>Centeno</i>, who lay along the Lake <i>Titicaca</i>, with
whom he Engag’d in the Plain <i>Guarina</i>: <i>Ludovico Ribera</i> Landing, <i>Centeno</i>’s Party fir’d
their Guns before the <i>Pizarrians</i> were within shot of him, of which <i>Carvayales</i> making
speedy use, drew up his Pieces close before the Enemy, and made an exceeding
slaughter amongst them, killing above a hundred and fifty Men in the first Onset;
the Horse amaz’d at the sudden destruction of the Foot, fled, leaving the remaining
Foot-Soldiers open to the Enemy, who was gotten behind them with his Musquetteers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>and with his Horse before, whilest six <i>Peruvians</i> carried away <i>Centeno</i> out
of the Fight, he lying sick on a Chair. <i>Pizarro</i> thus become Victor, kill’d all he
met with; of which <i>Gasca</i> being inform’d, resolving upon a private and sudden
Revenge, caus’d all Necessaries for War to be made ready, and march’d with a thousand
and nine hundred Men out of the Valley of <i>Xauxa</i> to <i>Cusco</i>, where by the Way
he was supply’d with the Forces, which the experienc’d Colonel <i>Peter Valdivia</i> had
brought from <i>Chili</i>; with which coming to <i>Andagua</i>, he took up his Quarters there
for some time, because the mild Winter had with continual Rains made the Ways
so dirty, that there was no travelling, and had rotted their Tents and <i>Maiz</i>, and also
occasion’d the Bloody-flux amongst the Soldiers. In <i>March</i>, <i>Gasca</i> broke up with
his Camp to cross the River <i>Apurima</i>, which he found very troublesom, because <i>Pizarro</i>
had broke down all the Bridges: But <i>Gasca</i> caus’d Wood and other Materials
to be carried to several places, that the Enemy should not certainly know his Intentions,
and at last march’d over deep snowy Mountains to <i>Cotabamba</i>, where suddenly
he made a Bridge, over which march’d four hundred Foot, but the Horse suffer’d
most damage; for sixty Horses loaden with Arms going to wade over, were
carried down by the Stream against sharp Rocks, by which they were desperately
gor’d in their sides, and many of them kill’d outright. <i>Pizarro</i> inform’d of the
Enemies whole Proceedings by his Spyes, sent <i>Acosta</i> thither with two hundred
Musquetteers, to fall upon those that were come over, whom he finding too many,
durst not venture to Engage with them. Mean while <i>Gasca</i>’s whole Army getting
over on the other side of the River <i>Apurima</i>, march’d up a high Hill, whilest <i>Pizarro</i>
Encamp’d himself five Leagues from <i>Cusco</i>, in a Plain call’d <i>Saguisagrana</i>, the
Entrance into his Camp being fortifi’d with six Field-Pieces, each side by a River
and several Mountains, and the Rere by a deep dry Moat: <i>Gasca</i> stood upon
a Hill and view’d the Enemy’s whole Forces lying in the Valley, and being oppress’d
with excessive Heat, whilest his Men were so exceedingly pinch’d with Cold
in the Night, that they were scarce able to hold their Arms, according to the strange
property of the <i>Peruvian</i> Climate; for the tops of Hills generally Freeze, whilest
the Valleys about a League from thence are parch’d with Heat: At Break-of-day
<i>Gasca</i> descended the Hill; his Horse being divided into two Wings, were Commanded,
the left by <i>Juan Savedra</i>, and the right by <i>Balthazar Castro</i>; <i>Mendoza</i> led some
Dragoons, <i>Valdivia</i> guarded the Guns, and <i>Gasca</i> himself march’d in the Front of the
Musquetteers. On the other side, <i>Pizarro</i> plac’d the <i>Peruvians</i> on his right Wing,
<i>Cepeda</i> and <i>Acosta</i> Commanded the Horse, <i>Carvayales</i> and <i>La Torre</i> the Foot, <i>Sebastian
Vergara</i> and <i>Peter Soria</i> guarded the Field-Pieces: But the Battel was scarce begun,
when <i>Cepedo</i> and a great part of the Horse deserting <i>Pizarro</i> went to joyn with
<i>Gasca</i>, and immediately after the right Wing of the Musquetteers; at the same
time <i>Centeno</i> and <i>Mendoza</i> fir’d amongst <i>Pizarro</i>’s main Body, of which some ran away
to <i>Cusco</i>, others with their Colours to <i>Gasca</i>’s Army. <i>Pizarro</i> seeing himself
thus forsaken, cry’d out, <i>Since all are fled to the Imperial Standard, I will also betake my self
thither, where perhaps I may find Mercy</i>: Whereupon <i>Acosta</i> answer’d, <i>Let us rather fall
in amongst the thickest of the Enemy, and die valiantly</i>: To which <i>Pizarro</i> reply’d, <i>No,
now I have lost Honor and Goods, I must take care for my Soul, that that may not be lost also</i>;
which said, he lighted from his Horse, Caparison’d in Silver, and deliver’d himself
and his Sword into the Hands of the Serjeant <i>Villavicenzo</i>, who found him Habited
in curious Armor, a Golden Helmet with a stately Plume of Feathers, and a Corslet
incircl’d with Emeraulds about his Neck: <i>Gasca</i> seeing him brought before him in
this manner, said thus unto him, <i>Have you not order’d your Business well, to waste so much
of the Emperor’s Treasure, and shed so much Blood, and all to confirm your self in your unlawful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>Usurpation of</i> Peru? To which <i>Pizarro</i> answer’d, saying, <i>I have spent my own Estate
in the Service of the</i> Spanish <i>Crown, and might lawfully take upon me the Government of</i> Peru,
<i>having with the loss of my Brother’s Life, and the hazard of my own, discover’d the same</i>.
<i>Carvayales</i> escaping out of the Fight, had hid himself in a Thicket of Canes, but
being discover’d by his own People, was by them brought before <i>Gasca</i>, who the
next day after the Battel caus’d him to be Quarter’d alive, and <i>Pizarro</i>’s Head to
be cut off in Prison; the other Prisoners were most of them kill’d in cold Blood.
<i>Gasca</i> thus become absolute Master of <i>Peru</i>, found an incredible Treasure left by
<i>Pizarro</i>, of which he gave to every common Soldier above six thousand <i>Ducats</i>;
and with this his victorious Army march’d to <i>Cusco</i>, where he employ’d his Executioners
afresh, in Hanging, Drawing, and the like; some that were stigmatiz’d
and condemn’d to the Galleys, accounted themselves happy that they had escap’d
so. <i>Gasca</i>, though Victor, perceiv’d no small Troubles to threaten him, having
twenty five hundred Men in Arms, of which every one for their faithful Service
judg’d that they deserv’d some Office or other, there being then above a hundred
and fifty to dispose of, <i>Pizarro</i> having Executed the chiefest Officers, and those
that bore any Command under him being either fled or kill’d in the last Fight: but
the small number of Officers that were wanting, was not to be compar’d to all
those that gap’d for Commissions. The Revenues, which yearly amounted to
eleven hundred thousand <i>Ducats</i>, went most of it away amongst the Officers, the
common Soldiers getting onely a small Snip out of it; wherefore many began to
murmur, and were upon the point of Mutinying, if <i>Cianca</i>, the Judge of criminal
Causes, taking the chief of them, had not punish’d them in such a manner, that all
the rest being terrifi’d, gave over their Complaints. After <i>Gasca</i> had spent above
nine hundred thousand <i>Ducats</i> in the War against <i>Pizarro</i>; all which Money he
took up upon Interest, which, after having setled the Kingdom in Quietness, he
paid for the most part with the Goods taken from the Rebels. Next he made a Law
concerning the <i>Peruvians</i> paying of Tribute, which before the <i>Spaniards</i> forc’d from
them whensoe’re and howsoe’re they pleas’d, with the greatest Tortures imaginable.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Peru</i> Governed by Vice-Roys.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Gasca</i> having again erected in <i>Los Reyos</i> the high Court of Judicature, in which
sat the Imperial Judges, return’d home with an unvaluable Mass of Treasure for
<i>Charles</i> the Fifth, and left the <i>Peruvian</i> Government to the Judge <i>Cianca</i>; since which
time <i>Peru</i> hath been Govern’d by Vice-Roys, the first whereof, who succeeded <i>Cianca</i>,
was <i>Antonio Mendoza</i>, and after him successively <i>Andreas Hurtado Mendoza</i>, <i>Diego
Valasco</i>, <i>Lopez Garcias de Castro</i>, <i>Francisco de Toledo</i>, <i>Martin Enriques</i>, <i>Garcias Mendoza</i>,
<i>Ludovico Velasco</i>, and <i>Juan Pacheco</i>, under whom the <i>Peruvian</i> Kingdom hath enjoy’d
Peace and Quiet, to the considerable enriching of the <i>Spanish</i> Inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus much of the antient Transactions in <i>Peru</i>, it will now be requisite to give
you a brief Account of the several Provinces in this mighty Kingdom.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Division of <i>Peru</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey is generally divided into three <i>Juridicial Resorts</i>, as they call them,
or Courts of Appeal, which are <i>Quito</i>, <i>Lima</i>, and <i>Charcas</i>; but the particular Provinces,
as they are commonly observ’d by Geographers, are said to be six, <i>viz.</i>
1. <i>Quito.</i> 2. <i>Los Quixos.</i> 3. <i>Lima.</i> 4. <i>Cusco.</i> 5. <i>Charcas.</i> and 6. <i>Collao.</i></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>
  <h4 id='c441' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. II.</span><br /> Quito.</h4>
</div>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Description of <i>Quito</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The first Province of <i>Peru</i> towards the North is <i>Quito</i>, or the new Kingdom
of <i>Granada</i>, with which on that side it is bounded, having on the West,
<i>Mare del Zur</i>; on the South, <i>Lima</i>; and on the East, <i>Los Quixos</i>. It lieth
in a manner right under the <i>Line</i>, and is said to be seventy two Leagues in length,
and in some places about twenty five in breadth.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Winter begins here in <i>October</i>, and continues till <i>March</i>, in which fall mighty
Showers, and on the Mountains abundance of Snow, but all the Summer long the
Sun is seldom darkned with a Cloud. Many of the Inhabitants die of a Giddiness
in the Head about the beginning and end of Summer. The <i>POX</i> also destroys
many of the Natives; with which Disease they are often born, and give it to the
<i>Spaniards</i>, who are not able to abstain from the <i>Indian</i> Women; they use <i>Sassaparilla</i>
and the Wood <i>Guaiacum</i> to cure themselves with.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here grow also many poysonous Herbs, which the <i>Peruvians</i> make use of to
poyson one another.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fruit <i>Quaba</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the farthest parts of <i>Quito</i> grows the salt and cooling Fruit <i>Quaba</i>, two Handfuls
long, cover’d with a grey Rind, and within full of white Pulp and hard
Kernels.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Tree <i>Guaiaba</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Tree <i>Guaiaba</i> hath a pale smooth Bark, thick Boughs, hard and glittering
Leaves, Flowers consisting of five Leaves, not unlike a Peacock’s Plume, long Apples,
woolly without, and within full of a pale red Pulp and eatable Stones; the
Root, which spreads it self very much, is sweet, and when boyl’d cures the Bloody-flux.
This Tree grows in most places, especially in low Grounds, the more because
the Kernels which the Birds picking out let fall on the Ground, spring up in
new Trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spanish</i> Fruits, as Peaches, Cittrons, Figs, Pomegranates, Pears, Quinces,
and Oranges, grow also here in great abundance, but when ripe are subject to rot.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, the Fields abound with Wheat, Barley, and <i>Maiz</i>; the Pastures afford
plenty of Grass for Oxen, Horses and Sheep, which bring forth Lambs twice
in fourteen Moneths.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Ocean and Rivers store of Fish; the Stream <i>Barbara</i> us’d formerly to produce
Gold also.</p>

<p class='c010'>In moist Grounds the Inhabitants find abundance of Salt-petre, the best that is
for the making of Gun-powder.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Inns <i>Tambos</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>For the Accommodation of Travellers, Inns call’d <i>Tambos</i>, are built near the
High-ways, exactly five Leagues distant one from another, where all sorts of Provisions
are sold at a set Price.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Nature of the People.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Natives antiently went Cloth’d in a Frock without Sleeves, as wide on the
top as at the bottom, and pleited their long Hair. They are strong, well proportion’d
in Body, and subtile enough to learn any Art, but treacherous, inconstant, and
inclin’d to Drunkenness: They were very hard also to be brought to receive the
<i>Roman</i> Religion, so that most of them would not suffer themselves to be Baptiz’d
till they lay a dying: They also drove a great Trade in Cotton, Wooll, and Cloth.</p>

<p class='c010'>Between <i>Pasto</i> and <i>Quito</i> are several Villages, and the famous High-way, by the
<i>Ingas</i> cut through the Wildernesses and Mountains, the Wall of an old Castle, and
the wonderful Stone-Bridge <i>Lumichaca</i>, which Nature hath made over the swift
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>River <i>Guaca</i>; it consists of a hard Cliff, at the Foot whereof is a great Arch,
through which the Water runs with exceeding force.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_504.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>This Tract of Land produces <i>Maiz</i>, and abundance of <i>Mortuanos</i>, a Fruit resembling
Damask Prunes, which eaten in excess cause Drunkenness and Faintness.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lake <i>Yaguarcocha</i>, signifying <i>Bloody-Water</i>, because the Inga <i>Guayanacava</i> kill’d
and drown’d twenty thousand there.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and Places of chief note.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chief Towns and Places of Note are, 1. <i>Caranguez</i>, antiently a Royal City,
where stood a sumptuous and stately Palace of the Kings of <i>Peru</i>, now almost deserted.
The Palace, built of Stone in a little Plain, without either Mortar or Iron-work,
manifests its former glory by its Ruines.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. The Royal Castle of <i>Atabalo</i>, or <i>Ottavallis</i>, in the building of which the <i>Ingas</i>
spar’d no Cost nor Charges; and indeed it is a Structure no way inferior to any of
the antient <i>Roman</i> Edifices. Between this Castle and <i>Cochequi</i>, a stately House, lies a
cold snowy Mountain. Moreover, the <i>Spaniards</i> have several Habitations along
the Way to <i>Quito</i>, and especially in the Valley <i>Annaquito</i>, where the Vice-Roy <i>Vela</i>
lost the Battel fought against <i>Gonsalvo Pizarro</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.  <i>Quito</i>, commonly call’d <i>St. Francisco de Quito</i>. There stood formerly here certain
Palaces, built by the <i>Ingas</i>, but the City was re-built by the <i>Spaniards</i> at the Foot
of a certain Ridge of Mountains, which it hath on the North and North-West side
of it, and are said by <i>Laet</i>, to cross the whole Countrey of <i>Peru</i> quite over from the
South to the North Sea: It was soon after the Building inhabited by five hundred
Families of <i>Spaniards</i> at least, besides Natives, and well fortifi’d, and might be
thought a Town very well seated in all respects, but for the neighborhood of a
Vulcan, which at times annoyeth it very much, as namely in the Year 1560. when
it vomited out such abundance of flaming Cinders and other sulphureous Matter,
that had it not been for a Shower of Rain unexpectedly falling, would have much
damnifi’d, if not destroy’d the Place. The Natives about <i>Quito</i> are more Moraliz’d
than other <i>Peruvians</i>. The Valleys which are warm’d by the Sun produce all manner
of Fruit-Trees and large Vineyards; and the Root <i>Papas</i>, not unlike Apples.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>The <i>Quimla</i>, which is of a Mans heighth, hath little Seeds, of which a pleasant Liquor
is boyl’d. From <i>Quito</i> the High-way leads to <i>Cusco</i>, along which at every four
Leagues distance stands a brave Palace; and from <i>Cusco</i> to <i>Chili</i>, being in all above
a thousand Leagues long. The City, built on a sandy Soyl, is divided in the middle
by a Moat, over which lead several Bridges: the Streets are large and streight,
and full of handsom Houses, and at the ends of the four chief Streets four Market-places.
Besides the Cathedral, are two other Churches, Dedicated to the Saints <i>Sebastian</i>
and <i>Blasius</i>. The Cloysters of the <i>Franciscans</i> and <i>Dominicans</i> are also no small
Ornament to the City. Besides other  stately Structures, are the Residences of the Receivers
of the Kings Revenues, to which the <i>Peruvians</i> that live about the City, being
computed no less than fifty thousand in number, pay Tribute; and to keep
them in subjection, the City <i>Quito</i> is always well stor’d with all manner of Ammunition
and Instruments of War. The chiefest Trade here consists in Sheep, Goats,
and other Cattel, Cotton-Clothes, Cloth, Flax, Hats, Cordage, Sugar and Salt;
which Salt, being grey and bitter, springs out of a Fountain in the Countrey <i>Mira</i>.
The Oyl, Wine, and Drugs which are us’d here, are fetch’d from the South Sea up
the River <i>Ambato</i>, and from thence with Carts into the City.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>Thomebamba</i>, famous for a Royal Palace, built there by some of the <i>Ingas</i>; It
lies Southward from <i>Quito</i> in the Province of <i>Canares</i>, where two Rivers commix
their Waters, near a Plain abounding with Venison. There yet remain considerable
Ruines of this Palace, in which one may discern the vast Dimensions of divers
Rooms, in some of which Arms were kept, and in others Provisions and
Clothes; of which kind of Buildings or Magazines the <i>Ingas</i> had erected above a
thousand in <i>Peru</i>, especially along the High-way, that they might have their Ammunition
ready in all places if need should require. On the left side of <i>Thomebamba</i>
appear’d the famous Temple of the Sun, whose Gates were not onely curiously
Painted, but also Inlay’d with Emeraulds. Both the Palace and Temple, adorn’d
with Gold and costly Images of great Touch-stone and Jasper, contain’d within
their Walls an unvaluable Treasure. These magnificent Structures are at this
day fall’n quite to decay. The People of this Countrey, who wear long Hair,
pleited on the top of their Heads like a Coronet, go Cloth’d in Cotton Coats
and Buskins of Hair-cloth. The Women, indifferent fair, and great admirers of the
<i>Spaniards</i>, Plough, Sowe, and gather in the Harvest, whilest the Men stay at home,
Spinning, Weaving, and doing of other Female-Offices. <i>Anno 1544.</i> they discover’d
Mines here, which produc’d as much Gold as Earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <i>Tacunga</i>, where was formerly another stately Palace, about fifteen Leagues
from <i>Cusco</i>, not far from the Mountain which some years since vomited Ashes and
Stones into the adjacent Fields. Hereabouts was formerly a Cloyster, inhabited
by the Nuns call’d <i>Namaconas</i>, the Ruines whereof are yet to be seen, with several
Houses of Stone, but cover’d with Thatch. The Natives in this Place are of a
brown Complexion, and of a very affable Nature.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <i>Mulambato</i>; 7. <i>Mocha</i>; 8. <i>Rhiobamba</i>, three small Villages, but each of them
credited with a stately Palace. Opposite to <i>Rhiobamba</i> lies the Province <i>Chumbo</i>,
from which a troublesom Way leads to <i>Guaynacapa</i> over the River <i>Chongo</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>9. <i>St. Jago de Puerto Viejo</i>, giving Denomination to the Territory about it, which
produces abundance of <i>Potatoe</i> Roots, <i>Maiz</i>, <i>Juca</i>, three sorts of <i>Guayavas</i>, <i>Cerezillas</i>,
and the Tree <i>Tunas</i>, which bears wild Figs. The <i>Spanish</i> Fruits grow here likewise
in great plenty. The fore-mention’d Beasts like Hogs, whose Navels grow on
their Backs, are also very common here. The Woods abound with Deer and all
sorts of Fowls, amongst which one resembling a Goose, and call’d <i>Xuta</i>; and another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>nam’d <i>Maca</i>, somewhat lesser than a Cock, and which feeding about the House,
may be reckon’d amongst the Poultrey of this Countrey. The Sea along the Coast
affords them abundance of <i>Bonito</i>’s, which eaten in some Seasons cause Agues. The
People along the Sea-Coast are generally troubled with Pimples and Sores in their
Faces, especially on their Foreheads and Noses, few of them living long, by reason
of the unhealthfulness of the Place through excessive Moisture, for the Rain continues
eight Moneths together.</p>

<p class='c010'>10. <i>Manta</i>, lying upon the Southern Ocean, the chief of the Villages, formerly
possess’d by the <i>Caranes</i>, betwixt the Promontory <i>Passao</i> and the River <i>Dable</i>. These
People are said to this day to carve and cut their Faces from their Ears to their
Chins; about their Necks and Arms they wear Chains of Gold and little red Corals,
call’d <i>Chaquina</i>, highly esteem’d by the <i>Peruvians</i>. This Town was formerly
famous for a great Emerauld, which was religiously worshipp’d there.</p>

<p class='c010'>11. <i>Guayaquil</i>, otherwise call’d <i>Culata</i>, built at a deep Inlet of the Sea, near the
River <i>Anebato</i>, which with great swiftness falls down from the Mountains <i>Quito</i>, is
surrounded with a fertile Soyl; and in the hollow Trees is found plenty of Honey.
The Water of the fore-mention’d River, being of great vertue in curing the <i>Morbus
Gallicus</i>, hath great resort of People from all places; who likewise gather the <i>Sarsaparilla</i>
that grows along the Banks. The Bridge which the Inga <i>Guaynacava</i> began
to lay cross this River, is also very remarkable, but he dying, it was left unfinish’d.
The <i>Guancabilcas</i> were heretofore under the Jurisdiction of this City <i>Guayaquil</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>12. <i>Castro</i>, so call’d from a strong Fort built there by a <i>Spanish</i> Captain, and situate
in the Valley <i>Vili</i>, not far from <i>Guayaquil</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>13. The City <i>Loxa</i>, built in the Countrey of the <i>Paltas</i>, a People that went naked,
between two Arms of the River <i>Catamayo</i> under a wholsom Climate, near the
High-way that leads to <i>Cusco</i> in the Valley <i>Curibamba</i>, where no poysonous Beast
was ever found. The Soil bears abundance of Oaks, Hazles, Ash, Willow, and
Cedar-Trees; <i>Maiz</i>, Barley, and Wheat. Not far from the City springs a hot and
sulphurous Fountain, which cures all sorts of Sores and Wounds. The Countrey
hereabouts is likewise stor’d with Fowls, Venison, Cattel, and Fish. Moreover,
the City receives no small lustre from two <i>Dominican</i>, and one <i>Franciscan</i> Cloyster.
Eastward from which lie desolate Mountains, whose tops are continually cover’d
with Snow. Not far from hence were formerly two noble Palaces, <i>Piedras</i> and
<i>Tamboblanco</i>, besides several Villages.</p>

<p class='c010'>14. <i>Cuenca</i>, wherein are also large Structures for the Monks and Priests: The
Countrey about the same hath rich Mines of Gold, Silver, Quicksilver, Copper,
Iron, and Sulphur.</p>

<p class='c010'>15. <i>Zamora</i>, Eastward from the cold Mountains <i>Andes</i>, built in a Marshy Soyl,
where the Inhabitants are never visited with Pestilential Distempers, and use no
other Physick for such Sicknesses as they are troubled with, than Tobacco, and the
Herb <i>Aquacolla</i>. But there is a certain Nut that grows hereabouts, which occasions
sudden death, if eaten raw, but being boyl’d, is a wholsom Food. The Mines afford
great pieces of Gold, of which one weighing eighteen Pound, was presented
to <i>Philip</i> the Second, King of <i>Spain</i>. The briny Springs produce good Salt. Three
Rivers falling from the Mountains, are noted for their Golden Sands, and also
afford delicious Fish. The Bees being here void of Stings, furnish the Inhabitants
with plenty of Honey. The Tygers and little Lyons devour many of the Sheep
<i>Pacos</i>, Goats, Hogs, and other Cattel, and sometimes the Natives themselves. The
City it self is neatly built with Woodden and Stone Houses, and adorn’d with a
Church and <i>Dominican</i> Cloyster, besides a stately Palace, the Residence for the King’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>Receiver. The Natives about this Place are a stupid and barbarous People, which
before the <i>Spaniards</i> coming thither, would for a small trifle kill one another.</p>

<p class='c010'>16. The City <i>Yaen</i>, situate in the Countrey <i>Chuiquimayo</i>; it is so call’d from a
swift River, cross which the <i>Peruvian</i> Women and Children swim, to the great
amazement of the <i>Spaniards</i>. They paint their Bodies black with the Juice of the
Root <i>Yaguas</i>, and feed for the most part on the stamp’d Plant <i>Yaca</i>. On the other
side of the Mountain, which rises on the Banks of <i>Chuquimayo</i>, lies the Countrey <i>Perico</i>,
fruitful and well inhabited, against which juts the Golden Countrey <i>Cherinos</i>.
<i>Peru</i> hath also several delightful Valleys, amongst which on the North the chiefest
are the <i>Tumbez</i>, <i>Solana</i>, <i>Poechos</i>, and <i>Piura</i>, all of them very fertile, full of stately
Buildings, and water’d by several Rivers.</p>

<p class='c010'>17. <i>San Miguel</i>, the first City that was built by the <i>Spaniards</i> in <i>Peru</i>, situate in a
sandy and dry Soyl, being extraordinary dusty in Summer, and very slabby in the
Winter, because the hard Ground cannot soak up the Rain. The <i>Ingas</i> made a
Way through this Valley fifteen Foot broad, between two Walls, and Planted
Trees on each side.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Spilbergen</i>’s Attempt upon <i>Payta</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>18. Westward from <i>Miguel</i> appears <i>Payta</i>, near a convenient Haven in the South-Sea,
which <i>Anno 1547.</i> was burnt by <i>Thomas Candish</i>; since which it had been re-built
twenty eight years, when <i>Joris Spilbergen</i>, after a hard Engagement with the
<i>Spanish</i> Admiral <i>Rodrigo Mendoza</i>, arriving in the large Haven before <i>Payta</i>, sent eight
Sail with three hundred Armed Men up to the City, where finding the Enemy
Encamp’d along the Shore, he return’d without any effect; but two of his Frigats,
the <i>Eolus</i> and the <i>Morning-Star</i>, running close to <i>Payta</i>, fir’d whole Broad-sides at the
same, whilest Captain <i>De Wit</i> took a <i>Peruvian</i> Fisher-man, who had been two
Moneths out at Sea, and taken abundance of Fish. The Guns which the Ships
fir’d upon the Town struck such a terror into the Citizens, that they fled with Bag
and Baggage into the Mountains, and left the City for a Prize to <i>Spilbergen</i>, who
setting fire on the same, in few hours burnt down two Churches, a <i>Dominican</i> Cloyster,
and several Alms-houses: But had not the Citizens been cowardly, they might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>easily have kept off the <i>Hollanders</i>; for the Vice-Roy <i>Ludovico Velasco</i> inform’d of
<i>Spilbergen</i>’s Arrival, had stor’d the Place with Ammunition and Men, whose Courage
failing, prov’d successful for the <i>Hollanders</i>, who whilest they Rid here at an
Anchor, took a very strange Bird on the Island <i>Lobos</i>, lying before <i>Payta</i>, being two
Yards high and three thick, in its Bill, Wings, and Claws resembling an Eagle, and
having a large Crest on its Head. Not long after <i>Donna Paula</i> being Governess of
<i>Payta</i>, a Lady famous in <i>Peru</i> for her Beauty and obliging Nature, sent Cabbages,
Oranges, Cittrons, and other Provisions to the <i>Hollanders</i>, and requested the Releasement
of some of the <i>Spaniards</i> taken in the Engagement against <i>Mendoza</i>, but
could not obtain her Request from the uncourtly <i>Dutchmen</i>.</p>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Description of <i>Los Quixos</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The Province of <i>Los Quixos</i> lieth South, and to the South-East of <i>Quito</i>, being
border’d more directly Eastward with a part of the Province of <i>Guiana</i>,
call’d by some <i>El Dorada</i>, or <i>The Golden Countrey</i>; on the South it hath <i>Lima</i>
and <i>Cusco</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Canela</i>-Fruit.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Province is subdivided into several lesser Territories, <i>viz.</i> <i>Canela</i>, <i>Pacomores</i>,
and <i>St. Juan de Salinas</i>. <i>Canela</i> is so call’d, because it hath many great Woods,
which produce the Fruit <i>Canela</i> in great abundance, the Owners whereof were most
inhumanely dealt with by the <i>Spaniards</i>; for <i>Gonsalvo Pizarro</i> supposing to get store
of Gold there, found nothing but Trees, bearing a Fruit like Olives, by the Natives
call’d <i>Canela</i>, with which they us’d to drive a great Trade, being otherwise
poor and simple People, living in Huts, which <i>Pizarro</i> pulling down, caus’d the
Inhabitants to be torn in pieces by his Dogs, because they could not furnish him
with Gold, nor direct him where it was to be had.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Granadilla</i>-Apple.</div>

<p class='c010'>Besides the <i>Canela</i>-Tree, this Countrey also produceth in great plenty the Tree
which beareth the Apples <i>Granadilla</i>, exceeding good against burning Feavers; the
Leaves are like Ivy, the Blossom resembling the Sun, and the long Leaves speckled
with Red and White, open three hours after Sun-rising, and close again before the
Evening, just as if Nature took care to preserve the beauty of the Flower.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and Places of chief note.</div>

<p class='c010'>In this part of the Province the chief are, 1. <i>Baeza</i>, otherwise call’d <i>Quixos</i>, built
in the Year 1559. by <i>Ramires de Avila</i>, eighteen Leagues from <i>Cusco</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Archidona</i>, twenty Leagues to the South-East of <i>Baeza</i>. 3. <i>Avila.</i> 4. <i>Sevilla
del Oro</i>, all of them <i>Spanish</i> Colonies.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Territories <i>Pacomores</i> and <i>Yguansongo</i>, otherwise call’d <i>The Countrey of Juan de
Salinas</i>, are said both to extend above a hundred Leagues in length, and little less in
breadth. The Fields afford store of Pasture for Cattel, the Plough’d Lands produce
Wheat and all sorts of wholsom Herbs; and in some places are also rich Gold-Mines.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Governor <i>Layola</i> built four Towns here, <i>viz.</i> 1. <i>Valladolid</i>; 2. <i>Loyola</i>; 3. <i>San
Jago de los Montanas</i>; and 4. <i>Caruma</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Jesuit <i>Acosta</i> relates, That not far from <i>Caruma</i> he found great Stones, some
of which were full of Golden Veins, but were hard to be cut from the Rock. Most
of the Gold is found in the Sand of several Rivers, the chiefest whereof flow through
<i>Quito</i>, <i>New Granada</i>, <i>Valdivia</i> in <i>Chili</i>, and <i>Caravaya</i> in <i>Peru</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the Point of <i>Quito</i>, the River <i>San Jago</i> falls into the Southern Ocean; the
Ground in the Mouth of the River being very uneven, for oftentimes the Ships are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>fast aground at the Stern, and on Head they have above eighty Fathom Water; yet
nevertheless the Shoals are no ways dangerous.</p>

<p class='c010'>South-West from <i>St. Jago</i> lies the spacious Inlet <i>Mattheo</i>, and the Promontory
<i>Francisco</i>, known by its Banks and high Grounds, which shew red and white at a
great distance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not far from hence, exactly under the <i>Equinox</i>, appears <i>Cape Passao</i>, flat and low;
between which and <i>Mattheo</i>, the great Rivers <i>Los Quiximes</i> fall into the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>Behind <i>Passao</i> rises the high Mountain <i>Quaque</i>; and more Westerly the Bay <i>Caraques</i>
affords a secure Harbor for all manner of Vessels.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next you come to the Town <i>Puerto Viejo</i> before mention’d, lying behind the
Island <i>Laurenso</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Five Leagues off at Sea, before <i>Laurenzo</i>, lies the Island <i>Plata</i>, formerly famous
for a <i>Peruvian</i> Temple, in which the Natives Sacrifis’d Sheep, and sometimes Children,
and painted the Figures of divers Persons with the Blood; to which they
also Offer’d Jewels, Gold, Silver, Wooll, Cotton Shirts, and Cloaks. <i>Francisco
Pizarro</i> arriving here, got an invaluable Mass of Treasure; but at present it lying
desolate, affords nothing but Brambles and wild Trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next which come in view are the Havens <i>Callo</i> and <i>Zalango</i>, where there are
safe Harbors, good Wood and Water.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Cape of <i>St. Helena</i> makes also a secure Road on the North, and on its Shore
hath a Spring, on the top of whose Waters swims a certain Gum, by the Natives
call’d <i>Copey</i>, exceeding good to make Ships tight.</p>

<p class='c010'>The River <i>Tumbez</i> falls into a large Bay, which on its North-East Point near the
Main Land, hath the Island <i>Puna</i>, ten Leagues in circumference: The Soyl whereof
produces abundance of <i>Maiz</i>, <i>Fuca</i>, and other good Roots, besides great Woods
full of fruitful Trees, and <i>Sarsaparilla</i>. The Inhabitants of a brown Complexion,
and middle Stature, wear Cotton Cloaks, and Chains of <i>Chaquira</i> and Precious
Stones: They drive a great Trade, and formerly maintain’d Wars with the People
inhabiting upon the River <i>Tumbez</i>; their great want is fresh Water in the
Summer. <i>Thomas Candish</i> Landing here <i>Anno 1587.</i> found a Ship hal’d ashore, and
three Villages, in one of which stood a Palace belonging to a <i>Casique</i>, surrounded
with Stone Galleries; and near it a large Store-house full of Tar-pots and Hemp
to make Cables of: The Village consisted of two hundred Houses, and a fair
Church with a Steeple, in which hung several Bells. The <i>Casique</i> Married to a <i>Spanish</i>
Woman being fled with the Villagers, <i>Candish</i> took many Oxen, fat Sheep, Pigeons
and Ducks, the Bells, and what else was not convey’d aboard, with him, and,
afterwards burnt the whole Town; but whilest he was busie in making havock, a
thousand <i>Spaniards</i>, and a considerable number of <i>Peruvians</i> fell upon the <i>English</i> on
such a sudden, that they kill’d some, and took others Prisoners.</p>

<p class='c010'>Somewhat farther off at Sea appears the Isle <i>Clara</i>, where those of <i>Puna</i> formerly
buried their Dead.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Inlet into which falls the River <i>Tumbez</i>, whose Shores are well inhabited,
ends Westward at the Promontory <i>Blanco</i>; Southward from which lies the Isle <i>Lobos</i>,
where there are several Springs full of the same Gum, or <i>Bitumen</i>, a little above
mention’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>Beyond the Point <i>Agua</i> lie the two Isles <i>Lobos Marinos</i>, opposite to a low Coast;
they are desolate, and barren of Grass, Trees, and all kind of Herbs, and destitute
of fresh Water; but many Pelicans, Penguins, and other strange Birds.</p>

<p class='c010'>The discovering of these Coasts belonging to the Jurisdiction of <i>Quito</i>, deserves a
short Relation:</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Bevalcazar</i> overcoming <i>Ruminagua</i>, takes <i>Quito</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>He comes to an Agreement with <i>Alvarado</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Pizarro</i> and his Army driven to great Straights.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Orellana</i> cross’d in his Designs, dies for grief.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The miserable Condition of <i>Pizarro</i>’s Men.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Quito</i> very much defac’d by siding with <i>Vela</i> against <i>Gonsalvo Pizarro</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>Whilest <i>Pizarro</i> kept the Inga <i>Attabaliba</i> Prisoner, he sent Captain <i>Bevalcazar</i> to
the new Fort <i>St. Miguel</i>, where eighty Horse and a hundred Foot being arriv’d from
<i>Panama</i> and <i>Nicaragua</i>, and he being inform’d that there lay a great Treasure in
<i>Quito</i>, and that the <i>Canares</i>, the <i>Spaniards</i> Friends, were exceedingly oppress’d by <i>Ruminagua</i>,
<i>Attabaliba</i>’s General, immediately march’d thither with the new arriv’d
Forces before mention’d, to fetch the Booty, and to assist the <i>Canares</i>; but several
things oppos’d him in his Design: for <i>Ruminagua</i> guarded the Way with twelve
hundred <i>Indians</i>, digg’d Pits in the same, and filling them with sharp Poles, cover’d
them slightly over with Canes and Earth; all which <i>Bevalcazar</i> shunning, went
about, fell in upon the Rere of the Enemy, and after a small Resistance conquer’d
the City <i>Quito</i>. Mean while <i>Ferdinand Cortesio</i> sent <i>Petro Alvarado</i> from <i>New Spain</i>,
who taking <i>Guatimala</i>, receiv’d a Commission from the <i>Spanish</i> Court, to subdue the
Northern parts of <i>Peru</i>. Soon after which <i>Garcias Holgua</i> being sent with two
Ships to enquire concerning the State of <i>Peru</i>, brought News back, That <i>Francisco
Pizarro</i> had gotten an unvaluable Treasure at <i>Caxamalca</i>; which so stirr’d up <i>Alvarado</i>,
that he Landed five hundred Men at <i>Puerto Viejo</i>, march’d in great want of
Provisions over the Mountains <i>Acabucos</i>, and had he not accidentally found a Pond
of sweet Water in a Thicket of Canes, both Men and Horses had all perish’d; at
last upon his approaching <i>Quito</i>, the Governor thereof, being <i>Bevalcazar</i>, not enduring
to suffer an Equal, drew up all his Men in Battel array; but some Persons interceding
between them, they were soon reconcil’d, and <i>Alvarado</i> being bought
out with a great sum of Money, deserted <i>Quito</i>; where after <i>Gonsalvo Pizarro</i>, had remain’d
a considerable time he march’d Eastward of the Province, which produces
abundance of Cinamon; whither he was accompanied by two hundred <i>Spaniards</i>
and four thousand <i>Peruvians</i>; against whom the Natives dwelling on the Borders
of <i>Los Quixos</i> fought very valiantly, till Night approaching, when they all ran away;
after which resting a while, there arose a mighty Tempest of Thunder and Lightning,
accompanied with a dreadful Earthquake, which swallow’d above five hundred
Houses, whole Woods and Fields, whilest an unknown River burst out of the
Earth, and overflow’d all the Countrey, insomuch that <i>Pizarro</i> expected nothing
but a speedy Ruine, in regard no Provisions were to be found in all the Countrey:
at last getting on the top of the nearest Mountain he lost many of his Men, who
were frozen to death with excessive Cold. From thence marching to the County
<i>Zumaque</i>, he got plenty of Provision and Cinamon, which grows on great Trees in
the Woods; the Leaves thereof resemble the Laurel; the Fruit grows in little Berries;
the Root and Bark have a strong odoriferous smell. Thence travelling to the
Town <i>Coca</i>, he found a mighty Cataract of Water, falling from a Rock above fifteen
hundred Ells high; insomuch that the noise in calm Weather was heard six Leagues
off. <i>Pizarro</i> leaving his sick People in <i>Zumaque</i>, went onely with a few Eastward
from <i>Coca</i> to the Plain Countrey <i>Guema</i>, full of Moorish Grounds, the Inhabitants
whereof went naked: at last he came to the great River <i>Maranon</i>, which falls from
the Mountains near <i>Quito</i>, and extends with several windings above eight hundred
Leagues in length, and at the Mouth thereof is fifteen Leagues broad, which at that
time overflowing all the Countrey, he judg’d it convenient to build a Brigantine,
making the Shoes of the dead Horses serve for Iron-work, his Mens Shirts for Sails,
and a Gum, which was to be had there, for Tar, and having Lanch’d  their Vessel,
and put all their Baggage and sick People into the same, they Sail’d close along the
Shore, on which <i>Pizarro</i> made his Way through Brambles and Canes, or went over
in the Brigantine whensoe’re he espy’d a better Path on the other side; in which
manner they were gone two hundred Leagues down the River, with no other Food
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>but wild Fruit and Roots; when Captain <i>Franciscus Orellana</i>, was order’d to Sail
away before with five Men, and seek out for Provisions, and at every Stream
which fell cross-ways out of the Countrey into the great River, he was to leave a
Mann’d Boat: but <i>Orellana</i> in few days drove down so far with the swift River,
that he saw no likelihood of getting up again in a whole year, neither could he
find any Provisions, but fought daily with the <i>Indians</i>, who came stoutly to Board
him in little Boats: amongst whom he was inform’d also, that thereabouts liv’d
the <i>Amazon</i> Women, that Warr’d continually against their Neighbors; and at last
he came into the Northern Ocean. But <i>Orellana</i> Sailing to <i>Spain</i>, obtain’d a Commission
to be Governor of the <i>Amazons</i> Countrey, whither he steer’d his Course
with five hundred Men in three Ships; but Landing at the <i>Canaries</i> they all ran away
from him, which so incens’d <i>Orellana</i>, that he soon after dy’d with Grief.
Mean while <i>Pizarro</i> inform’d by a <i>Spaniard</i> whom <i>Orellana</i> had put ashore, that the
Brigantine was by the strong Current carried into the Ocean, knew not what to
do, his People since their departure from <i>Quito</i> having travell’d above four hundred
Leagues, had eaten most of their Horses: Many dy’d by feeding on unwholsom
Herbs; others fell down dead for Hunger, or tir’d out with toilsom Travel;
their Clothes, rotted by the Rain, hung upon them like Rags, their Shoes were
worn out, their Feet full of Blisters, their Bodies sadly mangled with Brambles and
Thorns, for no place afforded them a Boat. <i>Pizarro</i> leaving the River <i>Maranon</i>,
went another Way, no less troublesom for steep Rocks and inaccessible Mountains.
The Valleys through which they went, began now to be strew’d with dead and sick
Bodies, who were not able to follow the Army, which march’d very fast, every
one judging to be so much nearer his preservation the farther he could get: Those
that fainted call’d continually on their Friends for help, but the Horses were
grown too weak to carry them: Every one saw nothing but Death before his
Eyes; wherefore, though call’d by their dearest and most intimate Friends that lay
a dying, they never look’d back, their compassion towards others being turn’d into
fear and care of themselves. The Forsaken implor’d their Saints, and besought <i>Pizarro</i>
for aid, but finding their Complaints to be in vain, and raging through despair,
they wish’d all the rest the same success, and the like Friends, whenever they
should be in the like Condition. <i>Pizarro</i> extreamly griev’d and troubled, that he
had brought the People into this Misery, sent a few Horsemen before to <i>Quito</i>, to
carry the sad News of his deplorable Condition, that they might immediately send
Provisions to him; which he receiving when he was within fifty Leagues from the
said City <i>Quito</i>, distributed amongst those that were left alive, who being also almost
starv’d, eat so greedily, that several of them were chok’d; the remainder were
kept a considerable time in Garrison under the Command of <i>Pizarro</i> in <i>Quito</i>.
Which City, built in a pleasant place, grew very populous in the Year 1544. there
being several Gold-Mines found about the same in that time. But this lasted not
long, for <i>Quito</i> siding with the Vice-Roy <i>Blasco Nunnez Vela</i> against <i>Gonsalvo Pizarro</i>,
most of the Citizens were destroy’d by him, and their Houses burnt to Ashes.
The like Destruction, and upon the same occasion, befel the three Villages in the
Province  <i>Bracomoros</i>, discover’d by <i>Juan Parzel</i> and Captain <i>Vergara</i>, together with
the Countrey <i>Chichiapoios</i>, where <i>Alphonso Alvarado</i> built the Town <i>Levanto</i>, surrounded
with deep Caverns, through which, to the great strengthning of the City,
flow several Rivers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Round about <i>Puerto Viejo</i> the Natives dwelt in Trees, whom the <i>Spaniards</i> had
much ado to bring under their subjection; for their Countrey being barren and
mountainous, was not onely wanting in Provisions to feed an Army, but the <i>Peruvians</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>also threw great Stones out of their Huts built in Trees, and likewise Javelins
and Pots full of boyling Water, with which they did much mischief to their Enemies
that Storm’d them, who at last covering themselves with Boards, cut down the
Trees, with which they falling were torn in pieces by the <i>Spanish</i> Dogs.</p>

<h4 id='c450' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. IV.</span><br /> Lima.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Description of the Province of <i>Lima</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Lima</i>, call’d also <i>Los Reyos</i>, hath on the East, <i>Collao</i>, and some part of <i>Cusco</i>;
on the North, <i>Los Quixos</i>; and on the South, <i>Charcas</i>. The Countrey extendeth
it self in length upon the Coasts of the South Sea two hundred and
fifty, some say, full three hundred Leagues in length, <i>viz.</i> from <i>Cape del Aguia</i> Northward,
on the Borders of <i>Quito</i> as far as <i>Arequipa</i> towards the South, and runs Eastward
to <i>Brasile</i> and <i>Rio de la Palma</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The several Valleys of this Province.</div>

<p class='c010'>In this Province are several very pleasant Valleys, the first whereof is <i>Motupe</i>, to
which a sandy Way leads from <i>St. Miguel de Valverde</i>, between barren Wilds, from
whence several Streams falling are immediately drunk up by the Sand; wherefore
all Travellers that go that way carry Water and Wine with them in <i>Calabashes</i> for
twenty Leagues together, which they Walk or Ride by Night, because of the excessive
heat of the Sun.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Valley <i>Motupe</i> grow abundance of Trees, which receive nourishment from
a River that springs up near the same. Here is also much Cotton.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not far from hence are the Valleys <i>Xayanca</i>, formerly very populous and full of
Palaces: The River which flows through the middle is led in Trenches amongst
the neighboring Fields.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Valley <i>Tuqueme</i> is also very pleasant, and the decay’d Palaces, sufficiently
testifie its former splendor.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next being <i>Cinto</i>, is no way inferior to <i>Tuqueme</i>; and between both lie sandy
Hills and barren Rocks, on which grow neither Trees nor Herbs, nor is any living
Creature to be found upon them: the Way through which being a whole days
Journey, cannot be travell’d without sure Guides.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Valley <i>Collique</i>, water’d by a River of the same Denomination, and very
thick set with Trees, was formerly very populous, but since the <i>Spanish</i> Wars it is
become quite desolate; for not onely a considerable number of them were slain by
the <i>Spaniards</i>, but also many destroy’d themselves, Wives and Children; of which
<i>Peter Martyr</i>, Councellor to the Emperor <i>Charles</i> the Fifth, sets down several terrible
Examples, of which two were remarkable above the rest; the first was after this
manner:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Two tragical Passages.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spanish</i> Captain <i>Olandus</i> Lying with the Daughter of an <i>Indian Casique</i>, question’d
when she grew big with Child, Whether she was with Child by him? and
that he might know the real truth by Torture, he caus’d her to be ty’d naked to a
woodden Spit, and laid to roast against a Fire made of green Wood, so that she
died in a most miserable manner; upon which her Father ran in a rage with
thirty of his Companions to <i>Olandus</i>’s House, where he kill’d his whole Family,
and locking all the Doors about the House, set fire on the same, into which
when it was at its greatest heighth, he and his Associates leap’d into the middle
thereof.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second Accident is also very terrible, <i>viz.</i> An <i>Indian</i> Maid being Got with
Child by a <i>Spanish</i> Ass-driver, acquainted her Father and Mother with it, withal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>telling them that she was ready to suffer Death for her Offence; and notwithstanding
they freely pardoning, and perswading her to the contrary, she eat raw <i>Juca</i>,
which when boyl’d is a wholsom Food, but if eaten raw, certain though languishing
Death; which she perceiving, ran to the next River, where after having wash’d her
self, she broke off from a large Tree a Bough of five Foot long, and making the
end thereof very sharp, fell upon the same, and so kill’d her self. Several other Ravish’d
Maids taking example hereby, hang’d themselves upon the Boughs of the
same Tree.</p>

<p class='c010'>But to proceed in our Description, next to <i>Collique</i> lies the Valley <i>Zana</i>, of the
like bigness, and famous for the City <i>Miraflores</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next is <i>Pascayamo</i>, which exceeds all the former in fruitfulness, and populousness
of Inhabitants, who before they were destroy’d by the <i>Ingas</i> were much
fear’d by their Neighbors. This Valley also was adorn’d with several fair Temples,
which are now turn’d into Cloysters. Cattel, Hogs, and Goats breed here
in very great numbers. The chief Trade of this Place consists in Cotton and
Linnen.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Valley <i>Chacama</i>, in which the <i>Dominican</i> Monks inhabit a brave Cloyster,
produces abundance of Sugar.</p>

<p class='c010'>Four Leagues farther lies the spacious Valley <i>Chimo</i>, so call’d from an old <i>Peruvian</i>
Heroe, which affords a pleasant Prospect, by reason of the many Banquetting-houses
built there by the <i>Ingas</i>. No place in <i>Peru</i> is able to stand in competition
with this for plenty of Provisions, the Ocean and Rivers producing store of Fish,
the Countrey affording Cattel and all manner of Fruit. The Cotton which grows
here is Shipp’d to the South Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Chanca</i> is a Valley chiefly considerable for the Town <i>Arnedo</i>, which is situate
therein, of which more hereafter.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Valley <i>Guanape</i>, not far from <i>Chanca</i>, yields the best <i>Peruvian</i> Liquor
<i>Chica</i>, and hath a convenient Harbor for Ships.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Plain <i>Santa</i> being overflow’d in the Winter, is all overgrown for want of
Inhabitants, who were all destroy’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>. The Woods hereabouts
swarm with a sort of venomous Bug, which exceedingly torments the Traveller.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Spilbergen</i>’s Attempt.</div>

<p class='c010'>Next follow in order the Valleys <i>Guambaico</i>, very fruitful, and <i>Guarney</i>, abounding
with Horses, Hogs, and other Cattel. <i>Joris Spilbergen</i> Landing here <i>Anno 1615.</i>
found the Haven secure against all Winds, and between the Shore and the Village
<i>Guarmey</i> a Creek, and somewhat farther a fresh-Water Pool; on one side of which
stood a decay’d Castle built of square Stone, whereon the <i>Hollanders</i> set the <i>States</i>
Flag, and Garrison’d the same to secure those that fetch’d Water out of the foremention’d
Pool. In the aforesaid Village stood a Church with a spiry Steeple;
behind which rose high Mountains, and at the Foot thereof a great Wood, into
which the Inhabitants fled with all their Goods, so that <i>Spilbergen</i> found nothing
but a little Meal, a few Hens, Hogs, and Oranges in their Houses, which whilest
he was sending Aboard, a small Body of Horse appear’d, but immediately fled into
the Woods. The <i>Hollanders</i> staying here seven days, were inform’d, that the Galley
<i>Jesu Maria</i>, Commanded by the Admiral <i>Rodrigo Mendoza</i>, and the <i>Santa Anna</i>, by the
Vice-Admiral <i>Peter Alvares Piger</i>, were both lost, not one Man being sav’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not far from thence lies the Valley <i>Parmonga</i>, which though it be fruitful and
pleasant, yet it is quite desolate; the Walls of a large Castle still appear, as testimonies
of its being formerly inhabited; and within the said Walls also are still to
be seen the Ruines of spacious Halls and fair Chambers, whose Walls are painted
with wild Beasts and Birds: The <i>Spaniards</i> have digg’d all about, and undermin’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>the same, in hopes to find, together with the several dead Bodies, a Treasure buried.
Two Leagues Southward from this Valley <i>Parmonga</i> flows the River, <i>Guayman</i>,
by the <i>Spaniards</i> call’d <i>Rio del Falcon</i>, from a Hawk which was seen there.
When any store of Rain falls here, a great part of the Dale <i>Barrana</i> lies under
Water.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange manner of Hunting.</div>

<p class='c010'>Not far from hence lie the Valleys <i>Gaura</i> and <i>Lima</i>; which last exceeds all others
in bigness, and was formerly exceeding populous; but since the Marquess <i>Pizarro</i>
built the City <i>Los Reyos</i> here, the Citizens have taken the Lands from the <i>Peruvians</i>.
The Mines hereabouts produce Gold and Silver. Amongst other things the Inhabitants
highly esteem an Herb bearing yellow Flowers, which in a short time cures
a putrifi’d Wound, whereas if laid on sound Flesh it eats the same to the Bone.
The Natives heretofore us’d to spend their time in Hunting, and caught their Game
after this manner, <i>viz.</i> three or four thousand of them would meet together,
and by taking Hands make a Ring of three or four Miles in circumference,
and at a certain Note or Tune Sung, or loudly Exclaim’d, they drew nearer and
nearer, till at last they were within Shot of the inclosed Game, whatsoever it
were.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A vast Treasure found by <i>Ferdinando Pizarro</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey of <i>Collao</i> hath a low Point, from which a long Cliff runs into the
Sea, towards the small Island call’d <i>Isla de Collao</i>: On each side of the Point the
Coast runs sloaping in, the one side extending North-West from <i>Collao</i>, to the Cliffs
<i>Piscadores</i>; the other South-East to the second Promontory; behind which is a
large Bay, where the Valley <i>Pachacama</i> appears, famous for its exceeding fruitfulness,
and a stately Temple built by the <i>Ingas</i>, where <i>Ferdinando Pizarro</i> found above
nine hundred thousand <i>Ducats</i>, besides what the Soldiers and Commanders took,
and what the Priests had hid, which none, though miserably tortur’d, would
confess.</p>

<p class='c010'>Opposite to <i>Pachacama</i> lies the Valley <i>Chilca</i>, where it never Rains, nor any Brook
or Spring moistens the dry Soil, which nevertheless produces <i>Maiz</i> and Fruit-Trees.
The Natives us’d to dig large and deep Pits, in which they Sow’d and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>Planted, and at every Root laid the Head of a Fish call’d a <i>Sardin</i>, which they caught
in Nets on the Sea-shore; wherein nevertheless nothing would have grown, but
for the Morning Dews which fell. The <i>Ingas</i> also had curious Banquetting-houses
here. In these Parts there grows a sort of Tree call’d <i>Mala</i>, of which <i>Acosta</i> relates a
strange Wonder of Nature, very remarkable, <i>viz.</i> That it flourishes and bears Fruit
on that side which beholds the South, in that Season when it is Summer on the
Mountains; the other which views the Sea, Blossoming and bearing Fruit when it
is Summer on the Plains.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Valley <i>Guarco</i>, spacious and full of Trees, produces especially the pleasant
Fruit <i>Guayaves</i> and <i>Guavas</i>, as also the best Wheat in <i>Peru</i>; wherefore it is vended all
over the Countrey. Here are also the Ruines of another stately Castle, built by
the <i>Ingas</i>, the former lustre whereof is testifi’d by its remaining Walls, which
consist of exceeding great Stones, so neatly joyn’d together without Mortar, that
it appears like one entire Stone; and by the decay’d Structures of several Halls,
much of the curious Painting whereof is yet to be seen; from the Castle a large
pair of Stairs led down to the Sea-shore. Two Leagues farther the River <i>Lunagun</i>
runs through the fertile Valley of the same Denomination. The fatness of this
Soil is chiefly ascrib’d to the Dung of a Fowl call’d <i>Guana</i>, which the Natives fetch
in great abundance from the Isles near the Main.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next follows the Valley <i>Chinca</i>, one of the biggest in all <i>Peru</i>, and before the <i>Spaniards</i>
Arrival very populous. In the time of the <i>Ingas</i> it also shew’d a magnificent
Temple Dedicated to the Sun, built by <i>Tepaja Jupangue</i>; yet the Inhabitants still remain’d
constant in the worshipping of their old Idol <i>Cinciapema</i>. Hither the <i>Ingas</i>
sent their conquer’d Princes, who on a certain time were to appear in <i>Cusco</i>. The
<i>Dominicans</i> at present possess here a neat Cloyster, from whence leads a plain Road
to the Dale <i>Ica</i>, water’d by the River <i>Pisco</i>, which is dry in Summer; wherefore the
Natives brought a Ditch from the Mountains, which since the <i>Spaniards</i> destroying
the Inhabitants, is choak’d up with Sand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next the Valley <i>Nasca</i> comes in view, famous for the Castle <i>Caxamalca</i>, where
the <i>Ingas</i> kept all manner of Ammunition for War, besides several Tombs, out
of which the <i>Spaniards</i> took great Riches. This Valley is divided into several others,
which for the most part produce Sugar-Canes; and through them all runs the
Royal High-way, which is Wall’d in on both sides.</p>

<p class='c010'>Beyond <i>Nasca</i> lie one behind another the Valleys <i>Hacari</i>, <i>Oconna</i>, <i>Camana</i>, and
<i>Quilca</i>, all of them affording good Pasture for Cattel, and Fruit, yet are most of
them desolate.</p>

<p class='c010'>The County <i>Los Motilonos</i>, thinly inhabited for want of Provisions, and divided
by two Rivers, separates <i>Moyobamba</i> from the Countrey <i>Charasmal</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Southward beyond <i>Caxamalca</i> appear the Countreys <i>Guamachuco</i>, and a little farther
<i>Conchucos</i> and <i>Piscobamba</i>, all fruitful and pleasant, and adorn’d with several
Structures built by the <i>Ingas</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the side of <i>Piscobamba</i> the County <i>Guaraz</i> extends it self over barren Mountains,
through which the <i>Ingas</i> cut a Royal High-way, and built a strong Castle
at the Entrance into the Countrey; the Inhabitants whereof being very laborious,
work very diligently in the Gold-Mines.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Territory  <i>Pincos</i>, water’d by a River, and famous for one of the stateliest
of the <i>Peruvian</i> Structures, is surrounded by the Countreys <i>Guayalcas</i>, <i>Turama</i>, <i>Bomba</i>,
and <i>Conchucos</i>. The Mountains, though dangerous to Travellers by Lyons, great
Bears, and other ravenous Beasts, afford abundance of Silver; and the fruitful Soil
produces Wheat, <i>Maiz</i>, Grapes, Figs, Oranges, Quinces, Cittrons, Cedars, and;
likewise feeds Goats, Horses, and other Cattel.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>The Countrey <i>Viticos</i>, being within the Jurisdiction of <i>Guanuco</i>, lies amongst the
Mountains <i>Andes</i>, whether <i>Inga Mango</i> fled, when the <i>Spaniards</i> made themselves
Masters of <i>Peru</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chief Towns and Places of note.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Towns and Places most observable and important in it belonging to the
<i>Spaniards</i>, are 1. <i>Miraflores</i>, as the <i>Spaniards</i> call it, a well seated and wealthy Town
in the Valley of <i>Zanu</i>, as above mention’d, five Leagues distant from the Sea, where
it hath likewise a good Haven or Port.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Truxillo</i>, two or three Leagues distant from the Sea; the Haven whereof is said
to be large, but not safe. The Town it self is seated in the Valley <i>Chinco</i>, upon the
Banks of a pleasant River, whose Water doth not onely run through several Channels
to moisten the Fields, but also to accommodate every House in the City: It
hath broad Streets, a great Market-place, four Cloysters, two for the <i>Dominicans</i>,
one for the <i>Augustines</i>, and the other for the <i>Franciscans</i>; one great Church, five
hundred Houses, and a Palace, inhabited by the King’s Collectors, and many Banquetting-houses
about it. The good situation and fruitfulness of the Soil, mov’d
the Marquess <i>Francisco Pizarro</i> to build this City here <i>Anno 1533.</i> but the Haven belonging
to the same lies open to all manner of Winds, so that the Ships Ride here
in great danger.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>La Parilla</i>, otherwise call’d <i>Santa</i>, fourteen Leagues beyond <i>Truxillo</i> Southward,
wash’d by the Southern Ocean, and one side by a fresh-water Stream, which
being inclos’d between stony Cliffs, makes a secure Harbor.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>Arnedo</i>, seated ten Leagues Northward from <i>Lima</i>, amongst the Vineyards of
the Valley <i>Chancas</i>; otherwise having no great matter in it remarkable, but a fair
<i>Dominican</i> Cloyster.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Prizes taken here by Sir <i>Fran. Drake</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Spilbergen</i> attempts the Place in vain.</div>

<p class='c010'>5. <i>Lima</i>, by the <i>Spaniards</i> commonly call’d <i>La Cividad de los Reyes</i>, or <i>The City of
Kings</i>, so nam’d because <i>Pizarro</i>, who built it, laid the first Stone on <i>Twelfth-day,
Anno 1553.</i> which they call <i>The Feast of the Kings</i>: It is seated in the Valley of <i>Lima</i>,
(from whence the City is also so denominated) one of the fruitfullest Parts of all
<i>Peru</i>, and so neatly built, that all the chief Streets of the City open upon a fair
Market-place, or <i>Piazza</i>, of such a large Square, that upon the sides thereof are
built, in a stately and convenient manner, the Cathedral, the Palace of the Archbishop,
the Vice-Roy’s Palace and Courts of Justice, with the Exchequer or Publick
Treasury, the Town-house or place where the City Magistrates meet and hold
their Courts, the Publick Armory or Magazine, and a Free-School, wherein are
taught by the <i>Jesuits</i> all Arts and Sciences, and also the <i>Indian</i> Language, and divers
other fair Buildings of the Nobility and better sort of Citizens. No Countrey under
the Heavens affords a more fruitful or pleasanter Place than this; the temperate
Climate neither troubling the Inhabitants with excessive Heats or great
Colds, nor terrifying them with Thunder or Lightning, but having almost perpetual
Sun-shine and fair Weather; onely the three Winter Moneths, wherein there falls
a sweet-smelling Dew, which cures the Head-ache; and there die but very few
of pestilential Distempers. The Countrey about the City is pleasant without exception.
The Pigeons which are kept here in curious Houses built on purpose, flie
a thousand in a Flight. The Fields abound also with Cattel. The Orchards and
Gardens flourish with all sorts of Trees and Plants, whereof those that are brought
hither from <i>Spain</i> grow better than in their natural Countrey. The West side of the
City is wash’d by a pure &amp; clear Stream, which stores the Market with great plenty
of good Fish, it being distant but a Musquet shot, especially when the Water rises.
This River is of great consequence, for it not onely waters the whole Valley of
<i>Lima</i> with its several Branches, but also runs under every House in the City, being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>built on Stone Arches; they are onely one Story high, because there is no Wood to
be had in the Valley of <i>Lima</i> but what in three years becomes all Woorm-eaten; nevertheless
the Houses are very beautiful both within and without; the Walls being
very thick and strong, have curious Arbors of green Boughs on the top, in which
the Owners shade themselves from the Sun. Most of the Houses built in the high
Streets have pleasant Turrets, which face the Market-place, where all sorts of
Provisions are brought to Sale, as Oxen, Sheep, Venison, Sugar, Oranges, Cittrons,
Grapes, and Wheat, which is ground in Water-Mills built near the River. This
City is inhabited by many able Merchants, which often load Ships to <i>Panama</i>, that
are valu’d at above two hundred thousand <i>Ducats</i>. To the Arch-bishop’s See of
this Place belongs the Bishopricks of <i>Chili</i>, <i>Charcas</i>, <i>Quito</i>, <i>Cusco</i>, <i>Truxillo</i>, <i>Guanuco</i>, <i>Popaian</i>,
<i>San Francisco</i>, <i>Panama</i>, <i>Nicaragua</i>, and <i>Rio de la Plata</i>. The City is also adorn’d
with two fair Churches, besides the Cathedral, and also other lesser Churches, four
stately Cloysters, two Nunneries, and the <i>Jesuits</i> Palace, which is very magnificent.
The Haven two Leagues distant from it, and call’d <i>Callao de Lima</i>, is large and secure
for Ships. <i>Anno 1579.</i> Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> took twelve Ships from hence, one
whereof was laden with Linnen and Silk, besides a great Chest full of Silver:
Which Inconvenience to prevent for the future, the <i>Spaniards</i> have built two strong
Forts, and fortifi’d them with Brass Guns. Thirty years after Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>’s
Exploit, <i>Joris Spilbergen</i> coming to Anchor here, found the Place all inhabited, a
Fort well stor’d with Guns, and a strong Castle before the Mouth of the Harbor,
from whence they shot Bullets of thirty six Pound weight at the <i>Hollanders</i>, and so
shatter’d their Frigat, call’d <i>The Hunter</i>, that she could scarce keep above Water:
Fourteen <i>Spanish</i> Merchant-men lying near the Shore, receiv’d little damage, <i>Spilbergen</i>
not being able for Shelves to get to them, neither did he judge it convenient
to Land, the Vice-Roy having at that time above four thousand Men in Arms, besides
several Troops of Horse;  wherefore after having fir’d several Guns on the
Fort, and against the Church, he set Sail to <i>Guarmey</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <i>Cannete</i>, otherwise call’d <i>Guarco</i>, from the Valley wherein it is situate: It was
built by the <i>Spaniards</i> out of the Treasure which they found in the Castle afore spoken
of in the same Valley.</p>

<p class='c010'>7. <i>Valverde</i>, situate in a Valley of the same Name, where excellent Fruit may be
had for a small Price; it is a well Traded and rich Town, about sixteen Leagues
distant from the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>8. <i>Pachacama</i>, situate in a Territory of the same Name, four Leagues Southward
of <i>Lima</i>, memorable chiefly for <i>Pizarro</i>’s good fortune here, who is reported to
have found in one onely old Temple of the Natives, the quantity of nine hundred
thousand <i>Ducats</i> of Gold and Silver, besides what his Soldiers are suppos’d to have
seiz’d on, and convey’d away before he came.</p>

<p class='c010'>9. <i>Castro Verreina</i>, threescore Leagues distant from <i>Lima</i> to the South-East: It
lieth in the Valley of <i>Chocolocha</i>, and is a rich Place, by reason of the good Mines of
Silver which are about it, and abundance of the best sort of Tobacco.</p>

<p class='c010'>10. <i>Miguel de la Ribera</i>, in the Valley of <i>Camana</i>. The Inhabitants whereof drive
a great Trade in Wine, Figs, and Raisins.</p>

<p class='c010'>11. The City <i>Arequipa</i>, which extends up towards the Mountains, is built in the
Dale <i>Quilca</i>, which runs eleven Leagues from the Sea, under a healthful Climate;
but in the Year 1582. it was wholly ruin’d by an Earthquake; the reason whereof
is ascrib’d to the wet sulphurous Mountains, which burns continually, and sometimes
vomits out Flames and Ashes. The Marquess <i>Pizarro</i> built this City forty
six years before the fore-mention’d Earthquake, since which being re-built again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>soon attain’d to three hundred Houses, besides a Church and Cloyster; and though
it be but a small Town, yet it is of a great resort, because the Gold and Silver is
brought hither from the Mines <i>Chancos</i>, <i>Porco</i>, and <i>Potosi</i>, and from thence sent
down the River <i>Quilca</i>, which washing the City Walls runs into the South Sea to <i>Los
Reyos</i>, and from thence to <i>Panama</i>, <i>Nombre de Dios</i>, and <i>New Spain</i>. The Jurisdiction
of this City <i>Arequipa</i> extends it self a vast way, <i>viz.</i> over the spacious Valleys between
<i>Hacari</i> and <i>Tampaca</i>, and up in the Countrey beyond the County <i>Condesuyo</i>,
full of Hamlets and Villages; the Inhabitants whereof heretofore worshipp’d the
Sun. By the Way from <i>Arequipa</i> to <i>Collao</i> lie two great Lakes, out of one of which
the River <i>Aparima</i> takes its original.</p>

<p class='c010'>12. <i>Caxamalca</i>, rather a Fort than a Town, in a Territory of the same Denomination,
built at the Foot of a Mountain wash’d with two Rivulets, over which lead
several Bridges; near which also were formerly a stately Temple Consecrated to
the Sun, wonderful Palaces and Baths for the <i>Ingas</i>, besides other magnificent
Structures of Noble-men, which were the more famous for <i>Attabaliba</i>’s Imprisonment
and Death. The Soil round about may compare with any part of the World
for fertility. The Inhabitants are a peaceable ingenious People, and make curious
woollen Hangings.</p>

<p class='c010'>13. <i>St. Juan de la Frontera</i>, built by the <i>Spaniards</i> North-East and by East from
<i>Caxamalca</i> in the County <i>Chiachinpoyas</i>, full of Gold-Mines and Cattel; to which belongs
not onely <i>Chiachinpoyas</i>, but also the Countreys <i>Guiancas</i> and <i>Cascainga</i>, out of
which above twenty thousand <i>Peruvians</i> pay Tribute to the <i>Spanish</i> King. These
People especially the Women, are very comely and beautiful; for which reason
the <i>Ingas</i> fetch’d their Wives and Concubines from thence. Eastward from <i>Frontera</i>
rise the high Mountains <i>Andes</i>, behind which flows the great River <i>Mayobamba</i> by
several poor Villages inhabited by a sottish kind of People.</p>

<p class='c010'>14. <i>San Jago de las Valles</i>, built in an ill place amongst the Shrubs and overflowing
Rivers. In this Countrey grows a Tree which bears a juicy Fruit, not unlike
an Almond in prickly Rinds, but resembling those which cover a Chesnut,
concerning which Physicians have deliver’d their Opinions, That there is not a
wholsomer Fruit in the whole World.</p>

<p class='c010'>15. <i>Leon de Guanuco</i>, which receiv’d that Denomination from its Builder <i>Vacca de
Castro</i>, who call’d it <i>Leon</i>, because he was born in the <i>Spanish</i> City <i>Leon</i>, and <i>Guanuco</i>
from the stately Palace of the <i>Ingas</i> which was built here: The Houses are built
of Free-stone, and cover’d with Thatch. The Citizens of <i>Los Reyos</i> were much
against the building of this Town, because several Lands belonging to them were
taken away and given to <i>Guanuco</i>, where the temperate Air grants long Life and
Health to the Inhabitants. The High-way, in which stand several Store-houses,
formerly full of Ammunition, runs through the middle of this Countrey, where
in the time of the <i>Ingas</i> dwelt Astronomers, who by looking on the Stars pretended
to tell future Events. Here the Women also us’d to be burnt alive with their Husbands.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Cusco</i> is the far greater part of the Province of <i>Peru</i>, containing generally all
the <i>Sierra</i>, or <i>Hill-Countreys</i>, and those parts of the <i>Andes</i> likewise which lie
Southward of the little Province or <i>Cantred</i> of <i>Guanuco</i>, being Coasted
Westward and to the North-West with <i>Lima</i>; Eastward, with <i>Los Quixos</i>, and some
part of <i>Guiana</i>; and on the South, with <i>Charcas</i>; enjoying for the most part a temperate
and good Air, neither over-heated with the scorching Sun in the day, nor
damp’d with any cold Mists or Dews in the Evening, as some parts of the Plains
of <i>Peru</i> are, but well water’d with many fresh Rivers, which make the Valleys and

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>In this Province also there are some lesser Divisions of Countreys necessary to
be describ’d, <i>viz.</i> the cold and barren Countrey <i>Bambon</i>, jutting against <i>Guanuco</i>,
inhabited antiently by a valiant People, especially near the Lake <i>Chincacocha</i>, which
is ten Leagues in circumference; in the middle of it are several Cliffs and little
Isles: And out of this Lake also the famous River <i>De la Plata</i> hath its original, and
runs through the Valley <i>Xauxa</i>, receiving by the way the Streams <i>Parcos</i>, <i>Bilcas</i>,
<i>Abancay</i>, <i>Apurima</i>, <i>Yucay</i>, and others.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next Countreys in order towards the South are <i>Tarana</i>, abounding with
Wheat, and the eminent Valley <i>Xauxa</i>, surrounded with snowy Mountains. The
Inhabitants by a general Name call’d <i>Guancas</i>, were antiently divided into three
sorts, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Maracabilca</i>, <i>Laxapalanga</i>, and <i>Xauxa</i>. Here were also several stately
Houses built by the <i>Ingas</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Upon this Valley borders the Village <i>Acos</i> near a Moorish place full of Canes;
but before you approach the Village you come near a high Plain, where the Ruines
of an antient Structure appear; and somewhat farther the Palace <i>Pico</i>: from
whence the High-way directs to the Bridge <i>Angoyaca</i>, which leads cross the River
<i>Xauxa</i>; near which the <i>Ingas</i> had several magnificent Structures, and Baths of
warm Springs. Not far from hence is the Village <i>Picoy</i>; between which and <i>Angoyaca</i>
the Arm of the River <i>Xauxa</i> is cut with a Bridge, because in the Winter it
glides so swift that they cannot Ferry over it.</p>

<p class='c010'>From <i>Picoy</i> you go to the Wild, in whose Center stands the antient Castle <i>Pucara</i>,

<p class='c010'>The Banks of the great River <i>Vinaque</i> are crown’d with the Ruines of antient
Structures, which (as the Natives relate) were built by foreign People; which Assertion
of theirs seems to be confirm’d by the form and manner of Building, differing

<p class='c010'>Not far from hence appears the Plain <i>Chapas</i>, and the Palaces <i>Pilcas</i>, of which
now nothing remains but a heap of Rubbish, which lies in the Center of <i>Peru</i>. A
fresh-water River, which gives the fore-mention’d Palaces their Denomination,
glides out of <i>Soras</i>, and washes the High-way and stately Temple of the Sun.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey <i>Soras</i>, exceeding fertile, and stock’d with Gold and Silver Mines,

which is Wall’d in on both sides, runs directly through deep Moorish Grounds
to <i>Cusco</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Peter Anzurez</i> his Journey.</div>

<p class='c010'>Eastward from <i>Cusco</i>, behind the <i>Andes</i>, are many large Countreys, which to discover
the <i>Spaniards</i> spar’d neither trouble, danger, nor charge: between both they
found vast Wildernesses, inaccessible Mountains, and overgrown Countreys; yet
at last they opened four ways thither: the first whereof runs through the Valley
<i>Paquil</i> to <i>Tono</i>, a Village in the middle of the Mountains; from thence to the River
<i>Opotazi</i>, along which it is very troublesom travelling, because of the thick Woods
and steep Rocks: lastly to the hot and fruitful Valley <i>Abisca</i>, and so to vast Wildernesses,
overgrown with Brambles and Bushes, which prevented any farther Discovery.
The second Way runs thirty Leagues farther to the Southward, through the
Countreys <i>Sandia</i>, <i>Camata</i> and <i>Caravaya</i>, to <i>Zama</i>. Through this Way, <i>Anno 1538.
Peter Anzurez</i> travell’d; setting out from <i>Zama</i>, he found many desolate Mountains,
barren Wilds, and close Woods, through which he entred into the County <i>Tacana</i>, and
from thence to the River <i>Omapalchas</i>, inhabited on both sides by the <i>Cheriabones</i> and
<i>Marquires</i>, who oppos’d him in his crossing over the River; but meeting with nothing
but barren Commons, he travell’d up along the River, and view’d the Countreys
<i>Moios</i>, <i>Cochabamba</i>, and <i>Chuguiabo</i>, from whence he return’d to <i>Collao</i>, having
lost most of his People by Hunger and Hardship. But not long after others went
over the <i>Andes</i> to the Countreys which extend themselves East and West, some
whereof travell’d through <i>Camata</i>, and others through <i>Cochabamba</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and Places of note.</div>

<p class='c010'>The principal Towns and Places of Trade in it are, 1. <i>Bombon</i>, situate upon the
Lake <i>Chinchacocha</i>, said to be ten Leagues in compass, begirt round about almost
with Hills, and having neighborhood with many other lesser, but pleasant Villages.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Parcos</i>, once a Palace Royal of the <i>Ingas</i>, seated on the top of a little Hill, encompass’d
with other Rocky and higher Mountains on all sides.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>San Juan de Vittoria</i>, which the Marquess <i>Pizarro</i> built <i>Anno 1539.</i> to secure the
Way between <i>Lima</i> and <i>Cusco</i>, from the Assaults of the <i>Peruvians</i>, before he absolutely
conquer’d this Kingdom: the Walls are wash’d by a sweet Stream, to the
great convenience of the Citizens.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>Guamanga</i>, a City lying in a pleasant Plain under a healthful Climate, built
with Stone-houses cover’d with Tyles; the Owners whereof have great store of
Land, which they Sowe with Wheat, and also breed plenty of Cattel. To this
City, which is adorn’d with three Churches, five Cloysters, and a large Almshouse,
above thirty thousand <i>Peruvians</i> bring annual Tribute. The Mines produce
Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron, Lead, Sulphur, and Load-stones; near which grows
the poysonous Herb <i>Mio</i>, which kills the Cattel that chance to eat thereof. In the
Woods also hereabouts feeds a Beast, whose Piss stinks at a Miles distance. This
City is by some deliver’d to be the same with <i>San Juan de la Vittoria</i> above mention’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <i>Bilcas</i>, another Palace of the <i>Ingas</i>, now a good Town of the Natives, and situate,
as is suppos’d, in the very midst of the Countrey of <i>Peru</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <i>Guancavelica</i>, a new Town, rais’d from the condition of a very poor Village,
to a Place of very great Importance and Traffick, onely by the Mines of Quicksilver,
which were first discover’d there in the Year 1566. by <i>Amador Cabrera</i>, through
the assistance of a <i>Peruvian</i> nam’d <i>Mavincopa</i>: This <i>Cabrera</i> selling his Interest for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>hundred and fifty thousand <i>Ducats</i>, Su’d the Buyer, upon pretence that he had sold
it above one half under the value: whilest this was depending, <i>Peter Ferdinando de
Valasco</i> came from <i>Mexico</i> to <i>Guamanga</i>, to make trial of the cleansing of Silver by
Quicksilver, and finding it to succeed according to his expectation, he sent great
quantities of it to <i>Arica</i>, and from thence by Land to <i>Potosi</i>. The King of <i>Spain</i> is
said to receive from this Mine of <i>Guancavelica</i>, all his Charges defray’d, above a thousand
Pound <i>per Annum</i> for his usual fifth part: But the antient Natives regarded not
these Mines so much for the Quicksilver as for the Vermilion which is found mix’d
with it, wherewith they delighted very much to paint their Bodies: There is
great Art now us’d in the separating of the Quicksilver from the Vermilion.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Town was long since inhabited by two thousand <i>Spaniards</i> at least, and
twice as many Natives.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The original of the City <i>Cusco</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>7. <i>Cusco</i>, which is the Metropolis of the Kingdom of <i>Peru</i>, built on a hard
Ground, surrounded with Mountains, under a cold, yet wholsom Climate, and
wash’d by two Rivers, which on the East side of <i>Cusco</i> parting, one runs direct
West, and the other Southward. One part of the City antiently bore the Denomination
of <i>Haran-Cusco</i>, and the second, <i>Oren-Cusco</i>, where the chief Nobility and
most antient Families dwelt. Concerning the original of this Place, the <i>Peruvians</i>
say, That several Ages past there appear’d three Men, call’d <i>Ayrache</i>, <i>Aranca</i>, and
<i>Ajarmango</i>, and with them three Women, nam’d <i>Mamacola</i>, <i>Mamacona</i>, and <i>Mamaragua</i>,
all of them very richly Cloth’d; that <i>Ayrache</i> had a Precious Stone at the end
of a Truncheon, which by holding up he rais’d the Mountains to the Skies, and
when he let it fall, levell’d them with the lowest Valleys: <i>Aranca</i> and <i>Ajarmango</i>
concluded to build a stately City, and sent for People from remote Countries to
inhabit it; with which Design the Natives thereabouts seem’d to be well pleas’d:
but before they went to work they judg’d it convenient to destroy <i>Ayrache</i>, whose
great Power they envy’d: This being resolv’d upon, they invited him to a deep
narrow-mouth’d Cave, that there they might worship the Sun his Father (for so
Descended he took upon him to be), he was no sooner entred but the rest shut the
Mouth of the Cave with great Stones, hoping so to starve him to death; which
<i>Ayrache</i> observing, stood amaz’d a while, till at last he threw off all the Stones, and
flew with great and divers colour’d Wings up into the Air, crying aloud, <i>Fear not</i>,
Aranca <i>and</i> Ajarmango, <i>though you have design’d to take away my Life, but build a City in
this place, and call it</i> Cusco; <i>for in it shall stand the Seat of the</i> Ingas, <i>under whose Jurisdiction
extending far and near, many great Nations shall bow. The Temple which the Gods have there
design’d shall not onely exceed all other Structures in the World, in Art and Costliness, but be famous
for strange Offerings to the Sun. If the Citizens build Altars for me, burn Myrrh, and make Offerings
to me, they may certainly expect to vanquish all their Enemies, and increase their Power.
According to my Example bore Holes through your Ears, as a sign of Obedience.</i> All which
<i>Aranca</i>, <i>Ajarmango</i>, and the fore-mention’d Women promis’d to perform. Whereupon
<i>Ayrache</i> gave them a rich Diadem with a Tassel, which was to be the Head-Ornament
of the succeeding <i>Ingas</i>; which they had no sooner receiv’d, but <i>Ayrache</i>
and <i>Aranca</i> were turn’d into Stones, yet retaining their former shape; which <i>Ajarmango</i>
observing, fell straight, together with the three Women, upon building the
City <i>Cusco</i>. After the Deluge breaking out of the Hole <i>Tambo</i>, he chang’d his Name of
<i>Ajarmango</i> for <i>Mangocapa</i>, that is, <i>Mighty Lord</i>, and made himself, as they say, the first
<i>Peruvian</i> King. The City <i>Cusco</i> was divided into four Wards, the East call’d <i>Andosayo</i>,
the South <i>Callasayo</i> the North, <i>Chinchasuyo</i>, and the West <i>Condesayo</i>, every one so
call’d from the Countreys, to which the Gates of the four Wards are oppos’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>If any one coming out of another Countrey, setled himself in <i>Cusco</i>, as it hapned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>daily, he was permitted to dwell no where but in that Ward which fronted his native
Countrey. The four high Streets, which through these Wards one way fall into
the Market-place, being in the middle of the City, are the other way answerable
to the four principal High-ways, <i>viz.</i> that which leads to <i>Quito</i> and <i>Pasto</i>,
through <i>Chinchasuyo</i>; to <i>Arehuipa</i>, through <i>Condesuyo</i>; to the Mountains <i>Andes</i>, through
<i>Andesuyo</i>; and to <i>Chili</i>, through <i>Collasuyo</i>. The two Rivers before mention’d, which
part at the East end of the City, are pass’d over with divers Bridges. The narrow
Streets are full of Stone Houses, built in good Order. In several places are
Vaulted Cellars under Ground, in some of which are buried great Treasures:
they had been formerly the Habitations for Necromancers and Soothsayers; for
this sort of People were once in great esteem amongst the Inhabitants, who coming
from <i>Chili</i>, <i>Pasto</i>, <i>Bocamores</i>, <i>Topona</i>, <i>Bombon</i>, <i>Charcas</i>, <i>Collao</i>, <i>Chiachiapoias</i>, <i>Conchucos</i>,
and other <i>Peruvian</i> Countreys, receive great benefit from the fresh Water,
and from the Corn-Mills built on the Streets through the City.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The antient Palaces and other stately Structures in <i>Cusco</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The stately Palaces which the <i>Peruvian</i> Nobility have at several times built in <i>Oren-Cusco</i>,
being one part of the City, are very wonderful, the Owners whereof were
forc’d by the <i>Ingas</i> to appear at Court at Set-times, that so he might prevent all Insurrections:
Also he caus’d the Children of the prime Lords to be brought up in
<i>Cusco</i>, under pretence that they might learn the <i>Cuscoan</i> Tongue perfectly, in which
the <i>Ingas</i> would always be spoken to; whenas their Design was to keep them as
Hostages in their own Jurisdictions, that their Fathers might not rebel; by which
means it hapned, that in most places of <i>Peru</i>, which amongst the several Tribes and
Principalities had several Languages, the <i>Cuscoan</i> Tongue was understood and spoken.
But the <i>Spaniards</i>, who are the present Possessors thereof, have alter’d and repair’d
most of the ordinary Houses, which are now neatly built of Stone. Above all
the old Structures, the Palace of the <i>Ingas</i>, and the Temple of the Sun, are the most
magnificent; the Palace lies inclos’d within a square quadruple Wall, each corner
whereof is adorn’d and strengthned with a Tower: The Palace it self is built
round, and with Arches; but that which chiefly amazes the Beholder, is to
see how the Stones, which are so big that forty Horses are not able to stir one of
them out of its place, were brought thither by the Labor of the Builders from the
neighboring Mountains; for the <i>Peruvians</i> never made use of any laboring Beast,
except their Sheep <i>Pacos</i>, not knowing the use of Horses, Camels, Oxen, Elephants,
or the like, before the <i>Spaniards</i> coming thither. The Halls within the Palace
were Wainscoted with Golden Plates: yet the <i>Inga</i>’s Apparel was not answerable
to the rest of his Pomp; for in stead of a Crown they bound their Heads
about with a red woollen Sash, with which they almost cover’d their Eyes; at the
end of the Sash hung certain Ribbands, which they gave the Governor as occasion
offer’d, that by this Sign, as by a Commission, they might exercise their Offices;
the sight of which String caus’d such Obedience, that if the <i>Inga</i> had commanded
the Inhabitants of a Town or Countrey to murder themselves, none durst deny.
The <i>Inga</i> was generally carried by a hundred of his Noble-men, of whom if any
one had accidentally chanc’d to stumble, he was immediately put to death. No
man durst presume to look him in the Face, or speak to him without a Present.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Temple <i>Curicanche</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>A cruel Battel between two Brothers.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Temple <i>Curicanche</i>, Dedicated to the Sun, was certainly the most rich and
sumptuous that ever the World boasted, it being Govern’d by the Chief Priest
<i>Villanoa</i>. The Inga <i>Guainacava</i> spent an invaluable Treasure in the building of this
Structure, for he cover’d the Roof and Walls with thick Plates of massie Gold and
Silver. At his return home from the Conquest of the Province of <i>Quito</i>, from
whence the Inhabitants, according to an antient Custom of the <i>Ingas</i>, were carried to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>one of the remotest Countreys in <i>Peru</i>. But <i>Guainacava</i> enamor’d of a <i>Quitoan</i>
Maid, staid a considerable time in the City <i>Quito</i>, and kept a splendid Wedding at
the Marriage of his Bride, who bare unto him the famous <i>Attabaliba</i>, whom he lov’d
beyond all his other Children, and a little before his death made him King of
<i>Quito</i>. But <i>Huascar</i> after <i>Guainacava</i>’s Decease would not suffer his Brother to live in
the late conquer’d Kingdom of <i>Quito</i>, but gave him Battel in the Plain of <i>Tomebamba</i>,
which lasted three days and three Nights, and after much Blood-shed, <i>Attabaliba</i>
being defeated was taken Prisoner, and not long after making his Escape by
the help of an antient Woman (whilest <i>Huascar</i>’s Commanders and Soldiers rejoyc’d
with Cups full of <i>Chica</i> for their gotten Victory) he made his Subjects in
<i>Quito</i> believe, that he being transform’d into a Serpent, crept through a little Hole
out of the Prison; and that he had a Promise from Heaven to obtain Conquest
over <i>Huascar</i>; which being believ’d, stirr’d up all his Subjects to take up Arms,
and valiantly to go and meet the Enemy, whom they not onely defeated, but
took <i>Huascar</i> Prisoner.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Zaires</i> the Son of <i>Mango Inga</i> submits to the <i>Spaniards</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Huascar</i> being destroy’d by <i>Attabaliba</i>, and <i>Attabaliba</i> by <i>Pizarro</i>, <i>Mango Inga</i> their
youngest Brother took the Government upon him, made continual Sallies upon
the <i>Spaniards</i> from inaccessible Mountains, and at his Decease left the remaining
part of <i>Peru</i> to his Son <i>Zaires Topa</i>; who seeing no good to be done by force of
Arms, submitted himself freely to the King of <i>Spain</i>’s Jurisdiction in the Year 1557.
since which the <i>Spaniards</i> have been sole Masters.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are at this day four great Churches in <i>Cusco</i>: Also the <i>Dominicans</i>, <i>Franciscans</i>,
<i>Augustines</i>, and the Monks <i>De la Merced</i>, have each of them stately Cloysters
here: but the <i>Jesuits</i> Structure exceeds all the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>Above forty thousand <i>Peruvians</i> pay annual Tribute to this City. In the Valley
about the City feed abundance of Cattel; also Wheat, and all manner of Herbs
grow here in great plenty. The Gold and Silver-Mines have not that resort which
they had formerly, most of the Workmen being remov’d to <i>Potosi</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Concerning the Service which they perform’d in the fore-mention’d Temple
of the Sun, and their superstitious Opinions about their Idol <i>Con</i>, they are much of
the same ridiculous nature with what hath been already Discours’d of in other places.
Five Leagues Southwardly from <i>Cusco</i> lies the Valley <i>Yucay</i> between high snowy
Mountains, under a temperate Climate and pleasant Soil. Not far from hence
the <i>Ingas</i> built a most invincible Castle on a Rock, which was surrounded with
many cliffy Walls one above another; these Walls were also Carv’d with Images
of Lyons, Tygers, and other wild Beasts, which held Lances in their Paws; the
top of the Rock was crown’d with a Royal Structure built of Stone, through
which ran Golden Veins, joyn’d together with a certain Gum, by some call’d
<i>Jews-Lime</i>. To the Province of <i>Condesuyo</i> belong the valiant People <i>Chumbibalcas</i>
and <i>Ubinas</i>. In the County <i>Pomatambo</i> they make Carpets of fine Wooll, curiously
Painted.</p>

<p class='c010'>8. The City <i>Francisco de Vittoria</i>, which lies in the rough Valley <i>Vilcabamba</i>, and
is inclos’d by the Mountains <i>Andes</i>, belonging to the Jurisdiction of the Province
<i>Andésuyo</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>9. The Village <i>Juan del Oro</i>, which is the chief Place of the Countrey <i>Caravaya</i>,
and so call’d by the <i>Spaniards</i> from the fine Gold which is found there in great abundance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Havens, Isles, and Points in <i>Peru</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Along the Sea-Coast of <i>Peru</i> belonging to the Jurisdiction of <i>Los Reyos</i>, lie the
following Havens, Isles and Points.</p>

<p class='c010'>South-East from the Promontory <i>Aguya</i>, rises the Isle <i>St. Roque</i> out of the South-Sea,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>surrounded with Rocks, and abounds with Birds of prey; through the midst
of it runs a River which divides the Island.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Haven <i>Malabrigo</i>, ill defended against the Winds, cannot be entred by great
Vessels, unless in calm Weather.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next follow the Harbors <i>Guanape</i> and <i>Santa</i>, where the Ships us’d to furnish
themselves with Water out of a fresh River; <i>Casuya</i> and <i>Guarmay</i>, both inhabited
by <i>Peruvians</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Near the Mouth of the Road <i>Guara</i> stands a large Salt-pan, the Salt about which
is found in great hard Pieces. The Island <i>Collao</i> secures the Haven before <i>Lima</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Behind <i>Cape Guarco</i> lies the <i>Lobos</i>; and not far from hence the Harbor <i>Sangallan</i>,
being so commodious that the <i>Spaniards</i> consider’d a long time whether they should
build the City <i>Los Reyos</i> here.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Promontory <i>Nasca</i> affords also good shelter for Ships; and the Haven
<i>Hacari</i> yields store of Refreshments. Moreover, the Streams <i>Oconna</i>, <i>Camana</i>, and
<i>Quilca</i> discharge their Waters into the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Haven <i>Arequipa</i> appears at its Mouth like a little Pool, surrounded with
Mountains.</p>

<p class='c010'>Between <i>Quilca</i> and the River <i>Tamboyalla</i> lies the Isle <i>Nuli</i>; and a little more

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Description of <i>Los Charcas</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Los Charcas</i> is the farthest Countrey Southward of the Kingdom of <i>Peru</i>, reaching
up as far as <i>Chile</i>, with which on the South it is border’d, having on
the North, <i>Lima</i> and <i>Collao</i>; on the West, <i>Mare del Zur</i>; and on the East,
some Countreys not yet well discover’d, which lie betwixt it and the Province of
<i>Paraguay</i>, or <i>De la Plata</i>. The Countrey is said to be in length about a hundred
and fifty Leagues, measuring it directly, or in a right Line from North to South;
but measuring it about along the Sea-Coast, much about two hundred: It is not
very rich either in Corn or Cattel, although in some parts it wanteth not good Pasturage;
but of unparalell’d Wealth, in respect of the Mines of Gold and Silver
which are here digg’d, the principal whereof are those of <i>Potosi</i> and <i>Parco</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Mountains hereabouts are inhabited by the <i>Cavinas</i>, who dwell in Stone
Houses. Their Neighbors the <i>Canches</i> are a subtile, good natur’d, and painful People,
breed many Sheep, sowe Corn, and catch plenty of Fish out of the Rivers.
Next comes in view the cold Countrey <i>Conas</i>. On the right side towards the Southern
Ocean, the great Wilderness <i>Parinacocha</i> extends it self a vast way; the Mountains
round about are continually cover’d with Snow, and the Dales have many
deep Moors.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Principal Towns and Places of note.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>Chief Towns and Places of note in this part of <i>Peru</i> are, 1. <i>Plata</i>, otherwise
call’d <i>Chuquisaca</i>, the Countrey whose Metropolis it is, situate under a temperate
Climate, in a fruitful Soil for the production of all manner of Plants, and
especially Wheat, Barley, and Grapes. In this City the High Court of Judicature
of <i>Los Charcas</i> is kept, being a principal part of <i>Peru</i>, and inhabited by the richest
<i>Spaniards</i> in the whole Kingdom, having gotten an incredible deal of Treasure out
of the neighboring Silver-Mines, which from the time of the <i>Ingas</i>, or Kings of
<i>Peru</i>, to its Discovery by the <i>Spaniards</i>, held out and continu’d so rich, that ’tis
thought <i>Pizarro</i>, if Reason could have rul’d him, might here onely have rais’d himself
a Rent of two hundred thousand Ducats <i>per Annum</i>; but his desire and hopes,
first to find more at <i>Potosi</i>, and afterwards his ambition and greediness to have and
command all, carried him to violent Courses, which proved his Ruine, as hath been
said. The Town is conveniently seated in a fruitful Soil, honor’d with the Residence
of the Governor of the Province, and with a Bishops See, said to be the
richest of <i>Peru</i>, <i>viz.</i> of fourscore thousand Ducats <i>per Annum</i>. The Cathedral and
divers Cloysters give also a great lustre to the City. The antient Inhabitants of
this Countrey, especially about those parts where now this City stands, were the
<i>Charcas</i> and <i>Charanques</i>, both valiant People, who by Command of the <i>Ingas</i> fetch’d
invaluable Treasures out of the neighboring Mines of <i>Porco</i>, where a thousand
Men were continually kept at work. In <i>La Plata</i> were reckon’d long since, besides
<i>Spaniards</i>, above sixty thousand <i>Peruvians</i> which pay annual Tribute.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Oropesa</i>, a place of good Metal, as a man may perceive by the Name; It lieth
in the rich and pleasant Valley <i>Cochobamba</i>, twenty Leagues distant from <i>La Plata</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>Potosi</i>, eighteen Leagues Westward from <i>La Plata</i>, by the <i>Spaniards</i> call’d <i>The
Imperial City</i>, built at the Foot of a Mountain bearing the same Denomination, on a
barren Soil under a cold Climate, though but twenty one Degrees to the Southward
of the <i>Equinoctial Line</i>: the Cold proceeds from the high Lands, which lie
bare to the bleak and sharp Winds call’d <i>Tomohavi</i>, which blow every year very
fiercely from <i>May</i> till <i>September</i>. But though the barren Countrey produces no
Fruit, yet no place in <i>Peru</i> hath greater plenty of all Provisions and Dainties than
this, the Markets being always full of Fruit, Salt-Meat, <i>Maiz</i>, <i>Papas</i>, Wheat, Sugar,
Sweet-meats, and all things that are requisite for the subsistence of Man-kind,
which are brought thither from all parts for the Silver, which is there in such
plenty. As to what concerns the famous Mountain <i>Potosi</i> in the Countrey of
<i>Charcas</i>, it is of an Ash colour, and rises above the adjacent Mountains in the form
of a Sugar-Loaf; on the top of it stands a Chappel, to which leads a craggy Path,
which with a little care may be rid up with a Horse; the heighth thereof is a thousand
six hundred and twenty four Rods, or a quarter of a League: at the Foot
thereof appears the Mine call’d <i>Guaina Potosi</i>, that is, The <i>young Potosi</i>; near which
the City <i>Potosi</i> stands, being two Leagues in circumference, and is adorn’d with a
Church and Cloyster for the <i>Dominicans</i>, and exceedingly resorted to by Traders.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the time when the <i>Ingas</i> Govern’d <i>Peru</i>, the Silver-Mines at <i>Porco</i> were very
famous; but it was not till after the arrival of the <i>Spaniards</i> that Silver was found
in <i>Guaina Potosi</i>, and by degrees the Silver Veins which lay hid in the great <i>Potosi</i>;
the manner of which Discovery was as followeth:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The occasion of the first Discovery of the Mines in <i>Potosi</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>A <i>Peruvian</i> call’d <i>Gualpa</i>, who work’d in the Mines at <i>Porco</i>, going a Hunting, it
chanc’d that the Game ran up the steep Mountain of <i>Potosi</i>, which prevented his
pursuing of it any farther; but the Mountain being overgrown with Trees, he
got hold from one Bough to another to help himself up, and at last taking hold of
the Bramble call’d <i>Quinua</i>, he pull’d the same out of the Ground, and finding it
heavy, look’d upon it, and espy’d a great lump of Silver hanging at the Root
of it; whereupon viewing the Hole, he discover’d a rich Silver Vein; of which
taking some pieces home, and melting them, he found that it was the best Silver
that ever he had known; wherefore he privately got a greater quantity, and by
degrees grew extraordinary rich: but though he carried his Design never so close,
yet he was at last suspected, and especially by his Neighbor <i>Guanca</i>, born in the
Valley <i>Xauxa</i>, who was the more jealous of him, because he sold greater Bars of
Silver than any were cast at <i>Porco</i>; whereupon he resolv’d to speak to him, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>getting out the Secret, it came to this Agreement between them, That they should
both be Partners and share the Booty; <i>Gualpa</i> was to keep the Vein, since call’d
<i>The Rich Vein</i>, and <i>Guanca</i> was to have another, at present nam’d <i>Diego Centeno</i>: but
they agreed not long; for <i>Guanca</i> finding much labor upon his Vein, by reason of
the hardness, and that he could get no share in what <i>Gualpa</i> got, acquainted his
<i>Spanish</i> Master <i>Vilaroel</i> with it, who rested not till he had found out the truth thereof;
for which <i>Vilaroel</i> obtain’d (according to the Custom of <i>Porco</i>) several Rods to
work for himself, onely paying the King one fifth part of what he got, and so remain’d
Owner of the Mine <i>Centeno</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Mine <i>Potosi</i>, when discover’d.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Discovery of the rich Mine <i>Potosi</i> is said to have hapned on the twenty
fourth of <i>April</i>, <i>Anno 1545.</i> Soon after which they found the Silver Vein <i>Del Estanno</i>,
which though it was very rich, was difficult to be digg’d, because of its hardness.
The first Vein which <i>Gualpa</i> search’d after stood upright from the bottom of the
Mine, and contain’d above three hundred Foot in length, and thirteen in breadth,
and continuing good for two hundred Foot in depth, after which the Silver begins
to lessen.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Peruvians</i> relate, That the <i>Ingas</i> first began to dig in <i>Potosi</i>, but gave it over
because the Workmen heard a terrible Voice, saying, <i>Leave off doing what you are
about; the Treasures which lie hid here, are reserv’d for a People out of foreign Countreys</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>These Mines produce yearly for the King’s fifth part, forty thousand Pieces of
Silver, each valu’d at thirteen <i>Ryals</i>, each <i>Ryal</i> being four Shillings, besides what
he is defrauded of, which is perhaps half as much more.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Mines of <i>Potosi</i> exceed all other, because the Diggers never meet with any
Water, notwithstanding they work above two hundred Fathom under Ground,
whereas the other Silver Mines suffer great damage by the Water; which was also
the reason why the <i>Spaniards</i> left off digging of Silver in <i>Porco</i>, because they were
not onely forc’d to cut through hard Rocks, but ran greater danger, or at least bestow’d
extraordinary labor to get out the Water which broke in upon them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Four Silver Veins, with their several Divisions.</div>

<p class='c010'>The four Silver Veins of <i>Potosi</i>, <i>viz.</i> <i>The Rich</i>, <i>Centeno</i>, <i>Del Estanno</i>, and <i>Mendieta</i>,
lie on the East-side of the Mountain, and extend North and South. The great
Veins produce lesser, not unlike the Body of a Tree, from which shoot forth several
degrees of Boughs. Each Vein is divided into several parts, possess’d by several
Owners; the least part is open’d four Rods, and the biggest eighty; for none are
permitted by the Law to open a bigger Hole. In the time of the Jesuit <i>Joseph de
Acosta</i>, an Eye-witness, who <i>Anno 1587.</i> went from <i>Peru</i> to <i>Spain</i>, the <i>Rich Vein</i> was
reckon’d to contain eighty seven Mines, of which some were digg’d two hundred
Fathom deep. The <i>Spaniards</i> judge that at the Root of the <i>Rich Vein</i> is an incredible
Treasure, though Experience hath hitherto taught us, that the Silver lessens in price
and quantity the deeper they dig in the Ground.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Socabonos</i> or Trenches, with the manner of Mining.</div>

<p class='c010'>For the more easie working in the Mines, the <i>Spaniards</i> have digg’d Trenches
(which they call <i>Socabonos</i>) at the Foot of the Mountain towards the West, cross
through the Mountain to the Mine, each of them being eight Foot broad and a
Fathom deep, and lock’d up with Gates, through which the Silver is carried out,
whereof the Owner of the <i>Socabon</i> receives a fifth part. The <i>Socabon</i> which leads to
the <i>Rich Vein</i>, was begun <i>Anno 1556.</i> and finish’d in twenty nine years, extends it
self two hundred and fifty Rods in length. The Miners work by Candle-light
both Day and Night by turns; those that work in the Day, sleep in the Night, and
those that work in the Night, sleep in the Day. The Oar, which is as hard as a
Stone, is cut out with Pick-axes, beaten in pieces with an Iron Crow, and carried
upon their Backs on Ladders made of Leather: Each Ladder hath three Fastnings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>about the thickness of a Cable, stretch’d out by Sticks, so that one goes up on one
side, whilest another comes down on the other. Each Ladder being ten Fathom
long, is pitch’d upon its several Floor on which the Laborers rest before they go
up higher, for they make divers Floors according to the depth of the Mine. The
Laborers carry the Oar in Bags fastned before on their Breasts, and falling back
over their Shoulders three and three together, the foremost whereof ties a lighted
Candle to his Thumb, and thus they help themselves with both Hands. It is a
wonderful thing to consider, how the <i>Peruvians</i> are able to scramble up and down
continually a hundred and fifty Fathom: But besides many other Inconveniences,
the Mines often fall in, or at least great pieces, which bury all the Diggers. The
Mines also, being excessive cold, occasion to those that are not us’d to them, a <i>Vertigo</i>
in the Head, and Vomiting. The Silver runs for the most part between two
Rocks, as it were, in a long Channel, of which one side is as hard as Flint, and
the other much softer. This Silver is of different value; the best, call’d <i>Cacilla</i> or
<i>Tacana</i>, resembles Amber in colour; the worser sort is blackish, and sometimes of
an Ash-colour. The pieces of Oar are carry’d on the Backs of the Sheep <i>Pacos</i> to
the Mill, where being ground to Powder, they are put into Furnaces to melt; of
which there were once above six thousand on the top of <i>Potosi</i>; but since the Quicksilver
was found to cleanse the same, not a third part remains pure.</p>

<p class='c010'>In former times the Mines at <i>Porco</i>, two Leagues from the little Lake <i>Aulagas</i>,
produc’d those vast Treasures gather’d by the <i>Ingas</i>, which afterwards for the most
part fell into the <i>Spaniards</i> Hands.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Port-Towns, Rivers, and Havens of <i>Los Charcas</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>As concerning the Sea-Coast of <i>Los Charcas</i>, it lies as followeth: Southerly
from the River <i>Tambopalla</i> puts forth a three-pointed Rock into the Ocean, and
makes the Haven <i>De Ylo</i>, into which falls a fresh River. Next follow the round
Hill <i>Morro de los Diabolos</i>, and the Inlet before the Town <i>Arica</i>, secur’d from all except
a Westerly Wind, where the Silver that comes from <i>Potosi</i> is Shipp’d for <i>Lima</i>.
Since the <i>English</i> Admiral Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> took three Barks out of this Inlet it is
fortifi’d with a Castle, which is stor’d with Brass Guns.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nine Leagues Southward the <i>Pissaqua</i> falls into the Ocean; and next you come
to the little Village <i>Hicahic</i>, situate on a high and barren Tract of Land; as also
the Haven <i>Terrapaca</i>, which by an Inland is made very secure.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not far from hence appears the Foot of <i>Piqua</i>, where the Coast begins to rise
very high; the Head of <i>Tacama</i>, the Stream <i>Lottoya</i>, otherwise call’d <i>De Loa</i>, whose
Banks are inhabited by poor People; the River <i>Montelo</i>, the Promontory <i>Morro
Moreno</i>, beyond whose utmost Point opens a Bay, secur’d from all Winds by an
Island. The Inhabitants here feed on raw Fish.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next the River <i>Claru</i> comes in view, which is taken for a Boundary between
<i>Peru</i> and <i>Chili</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eastward up into the Countrey you come to <i>Santa Cruiz</i>, built at the Foot of a
Mountain in a Plain near a Brook, which rushing forth from a Rock glides through
the City to a Lake full of delicious Fish. The Houses of Stone, are cover’d with
Palm-Tree Leaves; and besides the Church there is also a Cloyster, inhabited by
the Monks <i>De la Merced</i>. In former times the <i>Peruvian</i> Houses were built of Clay,
and were often destroy’d by their Neighbors the <i>Cheriguanacs</i> and <i>Titanes</i>, who made
Feasts with as many as they took of them. The People about this Place are meek
and poor spirited, and speak besides four Languages, the <i>Diagnitan</i> Tongue, common
amongst all of them. Before the Arrival of the <i>Spaniards</i> they went Cloth’d
in Ostritches Feathers, but since taught to weave Cotton, they now make their
Apparel of the same, and upon the account of Barter, drive a great Trade in it:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>They Dye their Cotton with the boyl’d Roots and Leaves of a little Tree.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eastward beyond <i>Santa Cruiz</i> lies the Countrey <i>Paicanos</i>, eminent for the great
<i>Calabashes</i> which grow there, exceeding good to keep both wet and dry Meats in.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey receives a vicissitude of excessive Cold and intolerable Heat; the
hard Winters taking beginning in <i>May</i>, and continuing till the beginning of <i>August</i>.
In the middle of our Summer a South-wind blows seven Weeks together here, to
the great prejudice of all Plants, which are during that time often wash’d away by
continual Rains. About <i>Christmas</i> they Sowe, and gather in their Harvest in <i>March</i>.
During the rainy Season the Ways cannot be travell’d, being all overflow’d by the
Rivers; neither doth the <i>Palm-Wood</i>, which is four days Journey in length, permit
any access to the said City <i>Santa Cruiz</i>, because the conflux of Waters makes it a
Moor all over; besides which, the Tygers, Bears, and Serpents, make the Ways
dangerous, especially at that time.</p>

<p class='c010'>Through this Countrey the <i>Spanish</i> Captain <i>Nusco de Chavas</i> travell’d, when he
discover’d the <i>Taguamacis</i>, a numerous People, which dwell along the great River
<i>De la Plata</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey about <i>Santa Cruiz</i> produces all manner of Fruit, but few Trees,
because of the want of Rain; but Corn, <i>Maiz</i>, Wine, <i>Granadillas</i>, <i>Luiumas</i>, and <i>Tucumay</i>,
as also the Plant <i>Hachalindi</i>, in the <i>Latine</i> Tongue call’d <i>Mirabile Peruanum</i>,
grow here in great abundance; which last shoots up to the bigness of a pretty
large Body, full of Juice, and of a yellowish colour, out of which shoot knotty
Boughs, and about each Knot two Leaves resembling the Herb <i>Nightshade</i>; the
Flowers which hang at the ends of the Boughs are long, and pleasant to the Eye,
by reason of their mixture of Purple, White, and Yellow, and also of a sweet smell.
It is a strange Secret in Nature, that this Flower opens at Midnight, if any Light
come near the same: The Root also is accounted an effectual Medicine against the
Dropsie.</p>

<h4 id='c466' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. VII.</span><br /> Collao.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Description of <i>Collao</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Collao</i> lieth Southward of those Countries, which go under the general Name
of the Province of <i>Cusco</i>, having on the West, <i>Lima</i>; on the South, <i>Charcas</i>;
but Eastward, and to the North-East, it is shut up by a Ridge of Mountains,
running in one Body or continu’d Tract from the Confines of <i>Collao</i>, as far
as the City of <i>Cusco</i>, where they divide. The Countrey is generally plain, commodiously
water’d in all Parts with fresh Rivers, and consequently affording rich Pasturage
and good Herds of Cattel.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chief Towns and Places of note.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chief Towns and Places of note are, 1. <i>Chuquinga</i>, a great Town, and held
to be naturally almost impregnable, as being environ’d round about either with
deep unfordable Waters, or with Mountains unpassable, and having one onely
Cawsey leading to it, reported to be for two or three Leagues together no broader
than to permit one single Person to march conveniently upon it.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. The City <i>Pucara</i>, which was formerly well inhabited, but at present nothing
remains of it, except the ruin’d Walls of great Houses, and large Images of Stone.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>Ayavire</i>, by the <i>Spaniards</i> call’d <i>Las Sepulturas</i>, being a Place especially enobled
by the stately Monuments of the <i>Peruvian</i> Nobility which were found there.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>Hatuncolla</i>, the Metropolis or chief Town of this Province, seated upon the
Banks of the River <i>Caravaya</i>, whose Streams are very much fam’d for Gold.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/i_533_full.jpg'><img src='images/i_533.jpg' alt='CALLAO de LIMA' class='ig001' /></a>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>The River <i>Caravaya</i>, which glides from the <i>Andes</i> Eastward to the City <i>Juan del
Oro</i>, produces much fine Gold, but not without the loss of many People, which are
kill’d by the unwholsom Air and Damps that arise here.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Lake <i>Titicaca</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Lake <i>Titicaca</i>, which washes the Countrey <i>Collao</i> on the North, the Province
of <i>Omasuy</i> on the East, <i>Chaquito</i> on the West, and <i>Chuquiabo</i> on the South, is one of
the greatest Lakes of <i>America</i>, being eighty Leagues in circumference, and in several
places as many Fathom deep; wherefore it is exceeding rough in windy Weather.
Into this Lake ten great Rivers discharge their Waters, which run away
again through a narrow, but very deep Channel, in which the Stream runs so
strong, that no Boats are able to abide in it.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <i>Chinquita</i>, a Colony of <i>Spaniards</i> upon the Banks of <i>Titicaca</i>, having many
small Islands in it of a good and fruitful Soil, abounding in Fish and variety of
Sea-Fowl; it is suppos’d to be fourscore Leagues distant likewise from the South
Sea, having onely one <i>Estuary</i> or Mouth, which is something strait, but of such a
deep Water and violent Stream, that (as <i>Acosta</i> testifieth of it) it is not possible to
build a Bridge of Stone or Timber over it; but the Natives in stead thereof have
laid a Bridge of Straw upon it, which serves as well, <i>viz.</i> so many great Bundles of
Straw, Sedge, or such like matter, well and surely made up and fastned together,
as will reach from one side or Bank of the <i>Estuary</i> to another; at which likewise having
made them sure, they cast some good quantity of more Straw and Sedge upon
them, and have a Bridge very convenient, upon which they both securely pass
themselves, and also drive Cattel, and do other necessary Business. The Water is
neither bitter nor brackish, yet is not drinkable because of its muddiness. Several
Islands that lie in the Lake serv’d formerly for Store-houses of the chiefest Goods,
which the People thereabouts living near the High-way would not trust in their
Villages.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Plant <i>Totara</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Here grows a certain Broom-Plant call’d <i>Totara</i>, good for many uses, and is also
wholsom Food both for Man and Beast; moreover, they cover their Houses with
the same, burn it on their Hearths, and make Boats. The <i>Uros</i>, a salvage People,
made Floats of <i>Totara</i>, which they ty’d together, and built Villages on the same,
which drove to and again, according as the Wind blew.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lake also breeds abundance of Fish, and especially two sorts, <i>viz.</i> <i>Suches</i>,
which are very pleasing to the Palate, but unwholsom; and the <i>Bogas</i>, which
though less, and full of Bones, are a much better Food. There likewise breed
plenty of Fowls about the same, especially wild Geese and Ducks.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the <i>Peruvians</i> intend to Entertain any Person, they go to catching of Fowls
(by them call’d <i>Chaco</i>) after this manner: They make a Circle with the Floats
nam’d <i>Balsas</i>, and Rowing close to one another, take up the inclos’d Fowl with
their Hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, the fore-mention’d Channel, through which the Lake <i>Titicaca</i> discharges
its Water, ends in a little Lake call’d <i>Aulagas</i>, likewise full of desolate Isles,
but hath no visible place into which to empty its Water, therefore it must needs,
according to the course of Nature, fall under Ground, where it commixes with a
Stream whose original is unknown, though it be seen to fall into the South Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Town is a Place of extraordinary Wealth and Trading, and so considerable,
that the Governor thereof is always nam’d by the King of <i>Spain</i> himself, and
his Place estimated at fifty thousand Ducats <i>per Annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <i>Tiaguanaco</i>, at the <i>Estuary</i>, or Mouth of the Lake, memorable onely for the
Ruines of certain great and stupendious Buildings which antiently have stood
there, some of the Stones whereof are said to have been of thirty Foot length
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>apiece, fifteen Foot broad, and six or seven Foot thick. There were likewise found
the Statues of certain Men excellently Carv’d and Wrought, of a Gigantick stature
or bigness, and likewise veiled in foreign and strange Habits, not at all us’d, nor
ever known to have been us’d by the <i>Peruvians</i> themselves, or by any other of the
Natives of <i>America</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>7. <i>Nuestra Sennora de la Paz</i>, or <i>Our Lady of Peace</i>, otherwise call’d <i>Pueblo Nuevo</i>:
It is but a small Town, yet pleasantly seated upon the Banks of a River in a fair and
fruitful Plain, full of Springs, Fruit-Trees, <i>Savanas</i>, and Fields of <i>Maiz</i>, having
Mountains on either side: It lieth almost in the middle of the Province <i>Chuquinabo</i>,
fourteen Leagues distant from <i>Cusco</i>, and as many from <i>Potosi</i>. The Province <i>Chuquinabo</i>
it self (which in the <i>Peruvian</i> Tongue signifies <i>Inheritance of Gold</i>) hath many
rich Gold-Mines, good Salt-pits, and a temperate Climate, except from the beginning
of <i>December</i> till <i>March</i>, in which time the continual Rains cause Feavers and
Agues. The Inhabitants being very poor People, us’d to go naked in the Summer
Season.</p>

<p class='c010'>8. <i>Copavana</i>, two and twenty Leagues beyond <i>Lopoz</i>: It is onely inhabited by
<i>Peruvians</i>; amongst whom an Image of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, long since erected there,
hath been ever in great veneration, especially by reason of a Tradition of a great
Miracle there perform’d: for the <i>Spaniards</i> affirm, That <i>Johannes Anachoreta</i> going
a Journey of several Weeks from home, plac’d a lighted Candle before the Image,
which during the time of his absence did not at all diminish.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A strange Earthquake at <i>Angoanga</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>An Accident which fell out in this Countrey is very remarkable, <i>viz.</i> The
Ground of an old Village call’d <i>Angoanga</i>, then inhabited by eminent Necromancers,
began on a sudden to swell, and the Earth to run like a broken Wave two
Leagues, overwhelming the Houses in Sand, and filling up a neighboring Lake.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The like in <i>Herefordshire</i> in <i>England</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Eight years before this terrible Earthquake here, there hapned in the County of
<i>Hereford</i> in <i>England</i> almost the same kind of prodigious Motion: for not far from
the Town <i>Ledborough</i>, arose <i>Marcely Hill</i> to an exceeding heighth, and moving along
bury’d all whate’re it met with, after which manner it continu’d for the space of
three days, to the great terror of all that beheld it.</p>

<p class='c010'>9. <i>Chilane</i>; 10. <i>Acos</i>; 11. <i>Pomata</i>, and some others, all of them good Towns,
but not so considerable as those other.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Roads and High-ways made by the <i>Ingas</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Concerning the Roads or High-ways, it may well be said, That none of the seven
Wonders of the World can compare with any one of them; neither was the Way that
<i>Appius Claudius</i> made from <i>Rome</i> to <i>Brundusium</i>, upon the repairing of which the Emperors
<i>Julius</i> and <i>Augustus</i> spent great sums of Money, fit to stand in competition
with the Roads made by the <i>Ingas</i> in <i>Peru</i>: for who cannot but admire at the consideration
of so many Valleys fill’d with Mountains, the hardest Rocks cut asunder,
Moors damm’d up, great Stone Bridges laid over swift gliding Streams, and
through vast Wildernesses a Way made of twenty Foot broad, inclos’d in high
Walls, extending from <i>Quito</i> to <i>Chilo</i>, a thousand Leagues, and at the end of every
ten Leagues brave Houses or Magazines, stor’d with Bowes, Arrows, Halberds,
Axes, Clubs, Clothes, and Provision for twenty or thirty thousand Men. Some
relate, that <i>Guainacava</i>, when he return’d Victor from the conquer’d Countrey
<i>Quito</i>, suffer’d great Inconveniences on the pathless Mountains, and thereupon
Commanded his Subjects to make the fore-mention’d Way. But it is more probable,
that this Master-piece was not the work of one <i>Inga</i>, especially since besides the
Way from <i>Chili</i> to <i>Quito</i> there leads another through the Mountains over the Plains
from <i>Cusco</i> to <i>Quito</i>, forty Foot broad, and five hundred Leagues long, inclos’d
within two Walls.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The manner of the <i>Peruvian</i> Registers.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>The <i>Peruvians</i> relate from the testimony of the <i>Quipos</i>, much more concerning
these High-Ways, and other Buildings on them, made by <i>Guainacava</i>. These <i>Quipos</i>
are Rowls of divers colour’d Strings, full of all manner of Knots, which serve in
stead of Characters to keep their Chronicles; in which were employ’d the <i>Quipo-Camayos</i>,
who being in the nature of our Secretaries, Registred all Transactions,
performing the same with the several Strings and Buttons, with which they
gave Obligations, Discharges, and the like: but besides the <i>Quipos</i> they also us’d
Rings full of little Stones for the same purpose; and knew with <i>Maiz</i>-Seed how to
cast up an Account as well as the best Arithmetician with Figures.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Account of Time hung on the twelve Pillars <i>Succanga</i>, erected on a Mountain
beyond <i>Cusco</i> by the Inga <i>Pachacuma</i>, that is, <i>The Regulator of the Year</i>, to shew
the Course of the Sun, and according to that their appointed Feast-days, times of
Sowing and Harvest: Their Year begins in <i>December</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The present State of <i>Peru</i> under the <i>Spanish</i> Government.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spanish</i> Government in the Kingdom of <i>Peru</i> is setled at present in great
tranquility and splendor. The Vice-Roy, who keeps a splendid Court in <i>Lima</i>,
otherwise call’d <i>Los Reyos</i>, Commands over <i>Chili</i> and <i>Terra Firma</i>, and never comes
abroad without a Guard of forty Halberdeers: when he travels by Land he is accompanied
by the Arch-bishop, and guarded by his forty Halberdeers, a hundred
Pike-men, and fifty Musquetteers. His Reign is generally not above six or eight
years, during which time he receives forty thousand Ducats <i>per Annum</i> out of the
King’s Exchequer.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The present flourishing Condition of the City <i>Los Reyos</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The City <i>Los Reyos</i> hath been of late years very much enlarg’d and brought to a
most flourishing Condition, being exceeding populous, and extending four
Miles in length, and half as much in breadth: In the biggest Market-place is the
City Hall and the Exchange, where all things are brought to be sold. Of the other
three Markets, two have their Denominations from <i>St. Anne</i> and <i>St. Jacob</i>; the
fourth is call’d <i>El Santo de los Cavallos</i>, because nothing but Mules, Asses, and Horses
are sold there. The chief Church is Consecrated to <i>St. John</i> the Evangelist; the
other Three to <i>Marcellus</i>, <i>Sebastian</i>, and <i>Anna</i>. The <i>Franciscans</i> inhabit three Cloysters;
the <i>Dominicans</i>, <i>Augustines</i>, and Monks <i>De la Merced</i>, each of them two, besides
two costly Structures for the <i>Jesuits</i>. Other Orders have also five Cloysters here,
<i>viz.</i> the <i>Creation</i>, <i>Conception</i>, the <i>Holy Trinity</i>, <i>St. Joseph</i>, and <i>St. Clara</i>; the three first
have each of them a Church built hard by the several Cloysters, Dedicated to the
<i>Santas Virgines del Montserratto</i>, <i>Del Prado</i>, and <i>De Loretto</i>. Each Cloyster contains
above two hundred and fifty either Monks or Nuns. Here are also four large Hospitals,
the chiefest whereof call’d <i>Andrias</i>, hath seldom less than four hundred Sick,
which are kept and cur’d on Charity. The second is for <i>Peruvians</i> onely, call’d <i>The
Hospital of St. Anna</i>. The third, built in honor of the Apostle <i>St. Peter</i>, is for poor
old Clergy-men. The fourth, nam’d <i>The House of Love</i>, is for sick Women. Besides
these there stands another Structure near the Walls of the City, Consecrated to <i>Lazarus</i>,
where those that have the Leprosie are cur’d. The House call’d <i>The Holy-Ghost</i>,
receives all sick and wounded Sea-men. The King maintains twenty four
Students at his own Charge in the Royal Colledge, and the Arch-bishop as many
in the Colledge call’d <i>St. Toronius</i>; but in the Colledge of <i>St. Martin</i> reside above
six hundred, which are brought up in all manner of Arts and Sciences. Two hundred
Students are also taught in the high School, where they chuse a new Governor
every year. Here also is kept the King’s Treasure, and the Court of Inquisition.
The River which washes the City Walls runs so exceeding swift, that not
long since it carried away a new Stone Bridge with nine great Arches.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Miracles reported to have been done by <i>Ramirez</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Dominican</i> Monks were the first that Landed on <i>Peru</i>, the first which came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>thither with <i>Francisco Pizarro</i> being <i>Vincent de Valle Verde</i>, who was follow’d by
<i>Sancio Martino</i>, <i>Martino de Esquivele</i>, <i>Dominico de Sancto Thoma</i>, <i>Pedro Ulloa</i>, <i>Alphonso de
Montenegro</i>, <i>Reynaldo Pedraza</i>, and many others, who were stirr’d up by the report
of the <i>Peruvian</i> Riches; amongst whom were four <i>Franciscans</i>, viz. <i>Pedro Portuguese</i>,
<i>Jodoco de los Angelos</i>, <i>De la Cruiz</i>, and <i>De Sant Anna</i>, who were soon after follow’d
by twelve Monks of the <i>Augustine</i> Order. <i>Anno 1552.</i> Landed also at <i>Los Reyos</i>,
Colonel <i>Andreas Salazar</i>, accompanied with <i>Antonio Lozano</i>, <i>Juan de Sancto Petro</i>, <i>Hieronymo
Melendez</i>, <i>Didaco Palamino</i>, <i>Pedro de Espeda</i>, <i>Andreas Ortega</i>, <i>Juan Canto</i>, <i>Juan
Chamorro</i>, <i>Francisco de Treyas</i>, <i>Juan Ramirez</i>, and <i>Balthazar Melgarego</i>. <i>Salazar</i> soon
after his Arrival sent the Priest <i>Juan Ramirez</i>, and <i>Balthazar Melganego</i> to <i>Guamachuco</i>,
where he Baptiz’d and Instructed the Inhabitants in great numbers. Afterwards
travelling to <i>Moyabamba</i>, he got a great esteem amongst those Idolaters, and (as it
goes for currant amongst them) wrought many Miracles, amongst which this is
reported for one: He being inform’d by an old <i>Peruvian</i>, that his Daughter nam’d
<i>Curi</i> had hid several Idols; enquiring after it, he tax’d her with what her Father
had told him; which she denying, and being rebuk’d by <i>Ramirez</i>, is said to have
become immediately dumb, to have foam’d at the Mouth, at last falling down
dead like a second <i>Saphira</i> in the presence of many, which caus’d many to forsake
their Idolatry. But the Necromancers endeavor’d by all means possible to raise a
disesteem on <i>Ramirez</i>, and with the assistance of their Master the Devil, so wrought
their Inchantments, that the Tygers came in great Herds out of the Wildernesses
to <i>Moyabamba</i>, and devour’d not onely Men, Women and Children in the Highways,
but also tore them out of their Houses, yet did not the least hurt to any <i>Spaniard</i>;
whereupon <i>Ramirez</i> valiantly went with a Company of his Proselytes to a
Herd of Tygers, which when he approached held the Cross to them, which it
seems so affrighted the Devil-Tygers, that they climb’d up the Trees. They
farther relate (if you will believe them) to make the Miracle the greater, That
<i>Ramirez</i> call’d to the Multitude, saying, <i>Go and revenge the Deaths of your devour’d Parents,
Children and Relations</i>; whereupon he throwing a Stone, and all the rest following
his Example, the Tygers leap’d out of the Trees, stood still, and suffer’d
themselves to be kill’d like Lambs. Six years after the fore-mention’d twelve <i>Augustine</i>
Monks follow’d eleven others, who set Sail out of the <i>Spanish</i> Haven <i>St. Lucar</i>,
and arriving at <i>Peru</i> went to the Village <i>Tauca</i>, where they broke the Image of the
Goddess <i>Huarella</i>, being as it were the <i>Peruvian Venus</i>, or Patroness of amorous Delights,
reported to have given Responses from the Wood in which she was worshipp’d.
They also destroy’d the Idol <i>Chanca</i> in the Countrey <i>Conchucos</i>, which being
worshipp’d by the <i>Indians</i> in the shape of a Man, had yearly a fair Maid, aged
fourteen years, given to him in Marriage, a solemn Wedding being kept, and several
Sheep kill’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Miracle of an <i>Augustine</i> Monk.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Augustine</i> Monks are believ’d to have wrought also another Miracle in the
Province <i>Conchucos</i>, upon this occasion: A Conjurer call’d <i>Chaumango</i>, boasted himself
to be <i>God</i>, deny’d our <i>Saviour</i>, in testimony whereof he gave out that he would
kick a Mountain to pieces, with his Foot; which Report spreading all over the
Countrey, all the adjacent People flock’d to see this strange Wonder on an appointed
Day, on which <i>Charimango</i> being, it seems, as good as his word, and kicking the
Mountain, caus’d it to rent from the top to the bottom, and the pieces to flie all
about the People, who were exceedingly amaz’d; but the Sorcerer upon the <i>Augustine</i>
Monk’s rebuking him was (as they affirm) immediately eaten up with Worms.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Description of <i>Chile</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Following the Coast of <i>Mare del Zur</i>, or the South Sea, the next great Province
pertaining formerly to the Kingdom of <i>Peru</i>, is that of <i>Chile</i>. This is the
most Southerly Province of the whole Countrey of <i>America</i>, reaching up as
far as the  <i>Magellane</i> Straights, with which to the Southward it is bounded; Northward
it hath a Desart, and an undiscover’d Countrey lying betwixt it and the Confines
of <i>Peru</i>, call’d <i>Atacama</i>; on the West it hath <i>Mare del Zur</i>; and on the East,
up to <i>Rio de la Plata</i>, the <i>Atlantick</i>, or North Sea, with some Countreys undiscover’d,
which interpose betwixt it and <i>Paraguay</i> to the North-East: It lieth all of it beyond
the <i>Tropick</i> of <i>Capricorn</i>, in a temperate <i>Zone</i>, and extendeth it self in length
from the Borders of <i>Peru</i>, to the Mouth of the <i>Straights</i> five hundred Leagues or
more; but the breadth of it neither equal nor certain: They say ’tis call’d <i>Chile</i>
from the word <i>Chil</i>, which signifies <i>Cold</i> it seems in their Language as well as ours,
it being generally a cold and bleak Countrey, the Air in many parts of it so extreamly
sharp and piercing, that both Horse and Rider sometimes in travelling are
frozen to death, as the <i>Spaniards</i> found by experience in their first Search and Discovery
of the Countrey, under the Conduct of <i>Diego Almagro</i>, who is said to have left
the greatest part of his Men dead behind him: But this is chiefly towards the <i>Andes</i>,
and on the Sea-Coast, the more Inland parts of it, though mountainous also in some
parts, yet are more temperate, and being also well water’d with Rivers, are much
more fruitfull than the other, affording both Wheat and <i>Maiz</i>, and likewise other
Grain, excellent Pasturage in many places, and great store of Cattel, Wine, Honey,
and not without many and rich Mines both of Gold and Silver.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Pedro Baldivia</i> taken Prisoner and put to death by the <i>Arucans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Natives of this Countrey were found to be the most stout and warlike of
all the <i>Americans</i> that the <i>Spaniards</i> had hitherto met withal, fighting with them,
and oftentimes defeating them in the open Field, surprizing and sacking their
Towns, and last of all taking their Captain and Commander in Chief Prisoner:
This was <i>Pedro Baldivia</i>, one of those good Men that consented to the death of <i>Attabaliba</i>,
the last King of <i>Peru</i>, after a greater Ransom accepted and paid, then perhaps
the King of <i>Spain</i> could well raise on a sudden, if he had occasion to use it for
himself. The <i>Arucans</i> (for so are the People call’d that had him Prisoner) are said
to have Entertain’d him for a while with great Jollity and Feasting, but for his last
Draught gave him a Cup of melted Gold, which the poor Man was forc’d to take
down, and so died a cruel, though costly Death.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>The whole Province generally is divided first into <i>Chile</i>, specially so call’d, and
secondly <i>Magellanica</i>, or that part which lieth more Southward down to the <i>Straights</i>
of <i>Magellan</i>.</p>

<h4 id='c472' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. II.</span><br /> Chile, properly so call’d.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The Bounds of <i>Chile</i> specially so call’d.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Chile</i>, specially so call’d, is border’d Northward with the Desart and barren
Countrey of <i>Atacama</i> above mention’d; on the South, with <i>Magellanica</i>;
on the West, with <i>Mare del Zur</i>; Eastward, and to the North-East, with
some parts of <i>Paraguay</i>, or rather with some undiscover’d Countreys lying betwixt
them both: The length of it from North to South is reckon’d to be little less than
three hundred Leagues, and generally of a fruitful Soil, affording besides abundance
of Gold and Silver, both Corn, Cattel, Vineyards, and divers sorts of Fruits,
equal both for kind and plenty to <i>Spain</i> it self, and sundry other parts of <i>Europe</i>.
The Air likewise temperate, and the People in their Manners and Conditions come
much nearer to the Civility, and likewise subtilty of the <i>Europeans</i>, than other
<i>Americans</i> did; which doubtless may be attributed to the conformity of the Climates
under which they lie, agreeable to those of <i>Europe</i>; though otherwise in respect of
the Sphere and Seasons of the Year, there be a diametrical difference betwixt us;
As for Example, their <i>Spring</i> beginning in <i>September</i>, which is our <i>Autumn</i>, and their
<i>Autumn</i> in <i>March</i>, which is our <i>Spring</i>; their longest Day being that of <i>St. Lucy</i>, on
the eleventh of <i>December</i>, which is our shortest; and their shortest being <i>St. Barnabas</i>,
<i>viz.</i> the eleventh of <i>June</i>, which is our longest, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and Places of Importance.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Towns of chiefest note and importance in this Province, are 1. <i>Gopiapo</i>, an
old Town in the most Northerly parts of this Province towards the Sea, where it
hath a very commodious Haven belonging to it.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>La Serena</i>, a Town situate on the Banks of <i>Coquimbo</i>, a pleasant River a little
above its Influx into the Sea, built by <i>Baldivia</i> in the Year 1544. the Countrey
about very rich in Mines of Gold, and the Town it self so well Garrison’d for fear
of the Natives, that when the <i>English</i> under Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>, about fourscore years
since, attempted the gaining of the Place, they found hot Service of it, being
stoutly resisted and beaten back again to their Ships, by a Sally of no less than
three hundred good Horse and two hundred Foot.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>St. Jago</i>, the principal Town of the Province, a Bishop’s See, and the ordinary
Residence of the Governor, lying on the Banks of the River <i>Tapocalma</i>, in the
thirty fourth Degree of Southern Latitude, fifteen Leagues distant from the South
Sea, at which it hath a very commodious and much frequented Haven, which they
call <i>Valparayso</i>, and where the <i>English</i> met with better fortune, as hath been said already
in the report of Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>’s Voyage.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>La Conception</i>, a strong Town, seated on the Bay call’d <i>Penco</i>, sixty or seventy
Leagues distant from <i>St. Jago</i> towards the South, a Place not a little fortifi’d both
by Nature and Art, having the Bay and a certain Ridge of high Mountains begirting
it almost round about; and where it is otherwise accessible, a Castle, and certain
Bulwarks with Ordnance, besides a Garrison of five hundred Soldiers at least
continually in it, and all little enough to defend it against the <i>Araucanes</i>, their deadly
Enemies, who live thereabouts, and are ever and anon making Incursions almost
up to the Walls of it. Over against this Place in <i>Mare del Zur</i>, but very near the
Shore, there lieth a certain Island call’d <i>St. Maries</i>, exceeding plentiful in Swine
and all sorts of Poultrey, which the Garrison of <i>La Conception</i> make good use of.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/i_543_full.jpg'><img src='images/i_543.jpg' alt='MAGELLANCICA.' class='ig001' /></a>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>5. <i>Los Confines</i>, a Fronteer Town, built by the aforesaid <i>Baldivia</i>, for defence of
the rich Mines of Gold at <i>Angol</i>, a Place near adjoyning.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <i>La Imperiale</i>, another strong Garrison of this Place on the Banks of the River
<i>Cauten</i>, near to which that great Battel was fought, where <i>Baldivia</i>, with divers
other Soldiers, were taken Prisoners, who were no otherwise overcome, but by being
over-wearied with killing of their Enemies, and by that means not able to
make their Retreat.</p>

<p class='c010'>7. <i>Villarica</i>, another Colony of the <i>Spaniards</i> in these Parts, sixteen Leagues distant
from <i>Imperiale</i>, and twenty five from the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>8. <i>Baldivia</i>, so nam’d from the Commander <i>Pedro Baldivia</i>, who built it in the
Valley of <i>Guadallanquen</i>, two or three Leagues distant from the Sea, where it hath a
good and capacious Port; but nearer to it the best Mines of <i>Peru</i>, so rich, that ’tis
said they yielded <i>Baldivia</i> every day so long as he could enjoy them, twenty five
thousand Crowns.</p>

<p class='c010'>9. <i>Osorno</i>, a Town lying in the Bay of <i>Chilue</i> in a barren Soil, but otherwise neither
less rich, nor less populous than <i>Baldivia</i> it self.</p>

<p class='c010'>These three last mention’d Towns, <i>viz.</i> <i>Baldivia</i>, <i>Imperiale</i>, and <i>Osorno</i>, were in
the Years 1596, 1699, and 1604, surpriz’d by the <i>Araucanes</i>, and other Salvages
confederate with them, sack’d and burnt; and though the <i>Spaniards</i> be said to have
recover’d and Garrison’d some of them with fresh Soldiers, yet how long they were
able to hold them, or whether they be Masters of them at this day, we cannot say.</p>

<p class='c010'>10. <i>Castro</i>, the most Southerly Town of the whole Province, built on a certain
Island within the Bay of <i>Chilue</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>11. <i>Mendoza</i>; and 12. <i>St. Juan de la Frontera</i>, both which lie towards <i>Paraguay</i>
and <i>Rio de la Plata</i>, but on the other side of the <i>Andes</i>, forty Leagues distant from
any of those we have spoken of, and perhaps more, not above a hundred from
<i>Buenos Ayres</i>, and the <i>Atlantick</i> Ocean.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sea-Port, Towns, Isles, and Straights.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Magellanica</i>, the other part of this Province, is bounded Northward, with
<i>Chile</i> abovesaid, and some parts of the Countrey <i>De la Plata</i>; on the South,
with the narrow Sea call’d <i>Magellans Straights</i>; having <i>Mare del Zur</i> on the
West, and on the East the <i>Atlantick</i> Ocean. It contains in length from the Borders
of <i>Chile</i> to the Mouth of the <i>Straights</i>, a hundred Leagues, and in breadth from the
North to the South Sea, somewhat more, <i>viz.</i> towards <i>Chile</i> and the North-West
parts of it, for towards the South and South-West it straitens still more and more,
insomuch that they who resemble the Southern part of <i>America</i> to the form of a Pyramid
revers’d, make this part of the Countrey to be the Spire or top thereof. It
beareth the Name from <i>Ferdinand Magellan</i>, a <i>Portuguese</i>, who first discover’d that
narrow Sea, so famously known by the Name of <i>Magellans Straights</i>. It is a large
Countrey, and suppos’d not to be altogether barren of Metals; but as yet no
great Discovery hath been made of it, partly by reason of the excessive Cold to
which ’tis thought to be subject, and partly perhaps by reason of the difficulty of
the Enterprize, it being so far remote, and very hardly passable in many places, by
reason of the huge Mountains the <i>Andes</i>, which bar it as it were against all Adventurers;
but chiefly by reason of the stoutness and untameableness of the <i>Araucanes</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>and other Natives of <i>Chile</i>, through whose Countrey the March lieth, and who
must first be conquer’d, so that very little can be said more of this Countrey, than
onely to name the Ports and Places upon the Sea-Coasts, at which the <i>Spaniards</i>,
and likewise some other Nations at several times have touched, the chief whereof
upon the South Sea are, 1. <i>Cabo de las Islas</i>, a Promontory or Foreland, twenty six
Leagues distant from that of <i>St. Felix</i> on the Confines of <i>Chile</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Puerto de San Stephano</i>, fifty Leagues from that, towards the South.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>La Villa de Nuestra Sennora</i>, or <i>Our Ladies Dale</i>, a large and secure Bay, eighteen
Leagues Southward of <i>St. Stephens</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>La Punta Deglada</i>; 5. <i>Puerto de los Reyos</i>; and 6. <i>Ancona Sin Salida</i>, all of them
opening towards the <i>Straights</i>. There is also at the opening of the Straights, <i>Cabo
de la Vittoria</i>, <i>Cabo Desseado</i>, and some others.</p>

<p class='c010'>Upon the North Sea, and up towards <i>Rio de la Plata</i>, the chief Places observable,
are 1. <i>Rio de la Crux</i>, and the Cape which they call <i>De las Rameras</i>, about thirty
Leagues distant from the <i>Straights</i> Mouth.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. The Bay of <i>St. Julian</i>, forty Leagues Northward of the former.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>El Puerto Desseado</i>; 4. <i>Puerto de los Leones</i>; 5. The Bay of <i>Anegada</i>, all of them
good and capacious Havens for the security of Shipping upon these Coasts, and
lying at a distance of thirty or forty Leagues one from another, up towards <i>Rio de
la Plata</i>, and the Countrey of <i>Paraguay</i>, of which we are next to speak.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the <i>Magellan</i> Straights.</div>

<p class='c010'>As for the Straights themselves, so much spoken of, and likewise so necessary to be
known by those who frequent these parts of the World, they are a narrow Sea or
Frith, by which the <i>Atlantick</i> Ocean, or rather some parts of it, doth fall into <i>Mare
de Zur</i>, or the South Sea: the Passage is long, running, as ’tis commonly suppos’d,
well nigh a hundred Leagues together, almost in a paralel Line, or in the same
Degree of Latitude from one end to the other; and likewise extreamly difficult by
reason of the many windings and turnings of the Sea, which force them to be ever
and anon altering of their Course, and a mountainous high Countrey on both sides
of it, from whence it is almost continually beaten with Storms, both dangerous
and terrible: They were first discover’d by <i>Ferdinand Magellan</i>, by Nation a <i>Portuguese</i>,
but in the Service of the King of <i>Spain</i>, and by him nam’d <i>Magellan’s Straights</i>;
who although himself liv’d not to return into <i>Spain</i>, being slain in the Conquest of
the <i>Molucca</i> Islands, yet his Companions did, in the Ship call’d <i>Vittoria</i>, from whence
the Cape <i>De la Vittoria</i> abovesaid took its Name. The Mouth or Entrance of
them, by the <i>Atlantick</i> Ocean, lies in fifty two Degrees of Southern Latitude,
and hath not above fifty three and some Minutes at the <i>Exit</i> or opening into the
South Sea.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Straights of <i>Le Maire</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>There is likewise since this, and but of late times, <i>viz.</i> about the Year 1615. another
<i>Straight</i> discover’d by the <i>Dutch</i>, and call’d from the Discoverer <i>Fretum Mairi</i>,
or <i>The Straights of le Maire</i>, four or five Degrees more to the Southward than those
of <i>Magellan</i>, and suppos’d to be a much earlier and safer Passage.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Intention by the discovery of these <i>Straights</i>, was to have found a shorter
Way to the <i>East-Indies</i> and the Kingdoms of <i>Cathay</i> and <i>China</i>, than that which was
then onely us’d, <i>viz.</i> by the <i>Cape de Buena Speranza</i>, and the Coast of <i>Africk</i>, but by
reason of the great difficulty, as ’tis to be suppos’d, and uncertainty of the Passage,
neither the one nor the other is much frequented, the <i>Spaniards</i> for the most
part serving themselves of their <i>American</i> Ports upon the South Sea, from whence
they make their Voyages and Returns to and from the other <i>Indies</i>, and from thence
home to <i>Spain</i>; and the <i>English</i>, with other Nations of <i>Europe</i>, Trading still by the
Coast of <i>Africk</i> and <i>Cape of Good Hope</i>, or else by the way of <i>Alexandria</i> and the <i>Persian</i>
Gulf, as heretofore.</p>

<h3 id='c475' class='c001'>CHAP. VI.<br /> Paraguay, or Rio de la Plata.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>We have seen in <i>Magellanica</i> the farthest, that is, the most Southerly part
of the <i>New World</i>, and before it in order all the Western Coasts of
<i>America</i> that lie either upon or towards <i>Mare del Zur</i>, <i>viz.</i>, from <i>Panama</i>,
the first Province of this Southern part down as far as the <i>Straights</i>. We are
now to return and take a view of the Eastern Coasts, and those Countreys which
lie upon the <i>Atlantick</i> Ocean, steering our Course henceforth Northward, not directly,
but as the Coast leads us for a while Eastward and by North, forasmuch as
the Land of <i>America</i>, from the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i> up as far as <i>Brasile</i>, and almost
to the <i>Æquator</i>, runneth out with a long Point, little less than three thousand
Leagues together.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Description of <i>Paraguay</i>, or <i>Rio de la Plata</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The first Province we meet with on this side next to <i>Magellanica</i>, is the Countrey
of <i>Paraguay</i>, oftentimes call’d <i>Rio de la Plata</i>, from the Name of an huge River,
which runneth for the most part through the midst of it: It is border’d, as we
said, to the South and towards the <i>Straights</i> with <i>Magellanica</i>; on the East, with the
<i>Atlantick</i> Ocean; more Northward, or to the North-East, it hath <i>Brasile</i>; and on
the West those undiscover’d Countreys of the Province of <i>Chile</i>, of which we have
spoken.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey on both sides the River is reported to be a very lusty and
fruitful Soil, bearing besides those which are proper and native, all sorts of <i>European</i>
Fruits and Grain in great abundance, with Sugar-Canes, both large and good, as
any other Province of the <i>New World</i>. Nor is it excell’d by any other for good
Pasturage and great Herds of Cattel, Sheep, and Swine; in particular, Horses are
said to have multiply’d so here, that of thirty Mares, and about six or seven Stallions,
which the <i>Spaniards</i> left there, in forty years the whole Countrey thereabouts
was fill’d with the Breed of them, running wild in great Companies together,
through all the Woods and Forrests of the Countrey, and being of excellent Mettle
and Service if they could be tam’d. It affordeth likewise great store of wild Deer
and Stags, some Lyons, Tygers, <i>&amp;c.</i> nor is it without good Mines, some both of
Gold and Silver; but chiefly, as to what is yet discover’d, of Brass, and Iron; and
the People altogether salvage.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The River <i>De la Plata</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The River <i>De la Plata</i>, which (as we said before) divides this Countrey, is one
of the largest of the whole World, rising, as ’tis suppos’d, out of the Lake call’d
<i>De los Xarayes</i>, three hundred Leagues or more within Land, and falling into the
<i>Atlantick</i> Ocean, or North Sea, in thirty four Degrees of Southern Latitude, with
an <i>Estuary</i> or Mouth of thirty, or two and thirty Leagues over.</p>

<p class='c010'>The whole Countrey is usually subdivided into three inferior Provinces, which
are 1. <i>Rio de la Plata</i> properly so call’d. 2. <i>Tucuman.</i> 3. <i>La Crux de Sierra.</i></p>

it self on both sides the River, in length many Leagues together, but
not answerable in breadth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and Places of note.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chiefest Towns of note in this Province, are 1. <i>Buenos Ayres</i>, by some call’d
<i>La Trinidad</i>, on the Southern Banks of the River <i>De la Plata</i>, sixty four Leagues, as
they say, from the Mouth of it: It is seated commodiously at the foot of a little
Mountain, and fortifi’d with a Mud-Wall, a little Castle, and some Pieces of
Ordnance.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>San Fe</i>, in English <i>St. Faiths</i>, fifty Leagues above <i>Buenos Ayres</i>, upon the same
River, and a richer Place, chiefly by reason of their Cloth, of which there is here
one of the greatest Manufactures of all these parts of <i>Peru</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>Nuestra Sennora de la Assumption</i>, commonly call’d <i>Assumption</i> onely, lying yet
higher up the River almost a hundred Leagues, a well built and well frequented
Town, long since inhabited by two hundred Families at least of natural <i>Spaniards</i>,
besides <i>Mestizos</i>, as they call them, which are the Breed of <i>Spaniards</i> by the <i>American</i>
People, Men or Women, and <i>Mulattos</i>, which are likewise their Race, but begotten
upon <i>Negro</i>’s, of both which there are reckon’d to be here some thousands.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>La Cividad Real</i>, or more commonly call’d <i>Ontiveros</i>, fourscore Leagues Northward
from <i>Assumption</i>, seated on the Banks of the River <i>Parana</i> in a fruitful Soil, as
the Countrey generally is about all these Places; but the Air hereabouts is not so
healthful.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <i>St. Anne</i>, upon the same River; and 6. <i>St. Salvador.</i></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Westward of <i>La Plata</i> lieth the Countrey of <i>Tucuman</i>, extending it self as
far as the Borders of <i>Chile</i>, a Countrey not yet well discover’d either

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. VII.<br /> Brasile.</h3>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Description of <i>Brasile</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Pedro Alvarez Capralis</i> his Expedition to <i>Brasile</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Brasile</i> by <i>Capralis</i> call’d <i>San Cruz</i>, because it was discover’d on the Day dedicated
to the holy Cross, but generally <i>Brasile</i>, from the red Wood, which it
produces in great abundance, extends, according to the Account of the
<i>Portuguese</i>, between the Rivers <i>Maranon</i> and <i>De la Plata</i>: But according to the Division
which Pope <i>Alexander</i> the Sixth made upon the Approbation of the Kings of
<i>Castile</i> and <i>Portuguese</i>, <i>Brasile</i> extends not so far; for it begins in the North along
the Stream <i>Para</i>, and ends at the River <i>Capybora</i>, two Leagues beyond the Town
<i>St. Vincent</i>: Eastward it is wash’d by the Northern Ocean, and on the West separated
from <i>Peru</i> by desolate Mountains: It lies between 4 and 22 Degrees of Southern
Latitude. Historiographers differ much concerning the first Discoverer; but
without contradiction the first honor belongs justly to <i>Americus Vesputius</i>, who being
sent out by <i>Ferdinand</i>, King of <i>Castile</i>, in the Year 1497. arriv’d first with four Sail
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>at <i>Brasile</i>; whither he was follow’d two years after by <i>Vincent Aynez Pinzon</i>, Associate
to <i>Christopher Columbus</i>; but with ill success, for two of the Ships were cast away
in a Storm, and the other two return’d sadly weather-beaten into the <i>Spanish</i> Haven
<i>Palos</i>, yet not before he had made a farther Discovery of <i>Brasile</i> than <i>Americus Vesputius</i>;
which so stirr’d up <i>Emanuel</i>, King of <i>Portugal</i>, that he sent <i>Pedro Alvarez Capralis</i>
thither with five hundred Men in thirteen Ships, that so he might get sure footing
on <i>Brasile</i>; where Landing he erected a Stone Cross, and inform’d the King of his
whole Proceedings by <i>Gasper Lemnius</i>, with whom he sent over two <i>Brasilians</i>, a Man
a Woman, the strangeness of whose Garb caus’d great admiration in <i>Portugal</i>
amongst the Spectators: the Man, having a flat Nose, went stark naked, and in
his nether Lip hung a Stone call’d <i>Matara</i>; through each Check there was stuck a
piece of <i>Brasile</i> Wood, on his Shoulders he carry’d three long Darts, and on his
Head he wore divers colour’d Feathers; the Hair about his Privities was all
pluckt out, and his <i>Membrum Virile</i> ty’d about with a String call’d <i>Tacoaynhaa</i>, which
he unty’d when he Urin’d; his Body was strong and well proportion’d, and painted
with several Colours. The Woman wore a Lappet girt about her Middle, in
which Girdle stuck a Cane Tobacco-pipe; the Lappet reach’d just to the top of
her Knees, the rest of her Body was also naked; on her Head she wore a broad Hat
made of Feathers, on the top of which stuck two Plumes; in her Ears hung Bells,
and about her Neck three Strings of Pearl; and her Body was also painted with
red and yellow Colours. <i>Lemnius</i> also gave so much Information concerning the
fruitfulness of <i>Brasile</i>, that several <i>Portuguese</i> Families went thither, accompanied
with some <i>Italian</i> Fryers, which scattering up and down, began to build several
Villages, but were soon after most of them kill’d and eaten up by the <i>Indians</i>.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_554.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Anno 1549.</i> King <i>John</i> the Third fitted out a great Fleet, which set Sail from
<i>Lisbon</i> under the Command of <i>Thomas de Sosa</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Jesuits</i> sent to <i>Brasile</i> by Pope <i>Paulus</i> the Third and <i>Ignatius</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Also the Jesuits <i>Aspilcueta</i>, <i>Antonio Pireo</i>, <i>Leonardo Nonno</i>, <i>Didaco Jacobo</i>, <i>Vincent Roderico</i>,
and <i>Emanuel Robrega</i>, were sent thither by Pope <i>Paulus</i> the Third, and <i>Ignatius
Loyola</i>, whose Fleet came to an Anchor in the Bay afterwards call’d <i>Bahia de Todos
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>Sanctos</i>, where <i>Sosa</i> built the City <i>Salvador</i>; since which the <i>Portuguese</i> have spread
themselves farther and farther over <i>Brasile</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Temperature of the Climate.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>United Netherlands</i> also sent Colonies thither with good success, for they took
several vast Countreys from the <i>Portuguese</i>, by force of Arms, and built new Forts
and Towns in several places. But we will first give you a general Description of
it, that so we may the better render a Relation in particular of every Province
thereof, it being a considerable part of the <i>New World</i>, and both pleasant and fruitful,
and the Sea-Coasts refresh’d by Easterly Winds, which begin before Day-break,
when the North Sea ebbs or flows, for then the Wind rises with the Sun, and
continues till Mid-night: Towards the West, where the Mountains divide <i>Brasile</i>
from <i>Peru</i>, it is made temperate by Westerly Winds, which though judg’d unwholsom,
because they seem to arise out of the Moorish Grounds, yet they hurt not the
Inhabitants along that Coast, because they either break against the high Mountains,
or are driven by the strong Wind which blows from the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>The difference between Summer and Winter, shorter and longer Days, in the
main part of <i>Brasile</i>, is scarce discernable, warm Weather lasting all the year round;
and for the length of the Day and Night, the Sun being hid under the Horizon
twelve hours, shines for the most part just as long, the greatest difference never
being above an hour. Three hours before Day-break the Dew makes it exceeding
cold till Sun-rising; wherefore the <i>Brasilians</i> make Fires in the Night near their
Hammocks, not onely to keep wild Beasts from them, but also against the Cold.
After the coldest Nights follow the fairest Days, and the contrary after sultry
Nights; nevertheless (except in the rainy Season, which begins with <i>March</i> and
ends about <i>August</i>) the Skye is generally clear, yet it Lightens much towards the
Evening. Rainbowes often appear in the Skye, and bout the Moon <i>Halos</i>.
The Rain generally falls in great Drops, and with a mighty noise; before
which it is generally very sultry hot, or else soon after. The Dew, which is fruitfuller
than in <i>Europe</i>, is saltish, which makes it oft to rot things that lie in the open
Air. During the rainy Moneths, a South-East Winds blows from a cloudy Skye,
much stronger than the Northern in Summer. The South-East Wind drives the
Stream to the North, as the North Wind drives it to the South: And more than
this, there is little to be discern’d of the Seas ebbing and flowing hereabouts: At
the highest Tides the <i>Brasilians</i> go several Leagues from the Shore to Fish, upon
Planks made of the spungy Wood call’d <i>Jangada</i> fastned together. The Sea, which
seems to burn in the Night, is so clear in the Day, that the Fish may be seen to
swim above twenty Fathom deep. A calm Ocean when the Days and Nights
are of an exact length, and especially when dark Clouds appear, is a certain sign
of a dreadful Storm. At Full or New-Moon the Sea rises twelve Foot, and continues
either a longer or shorter time, according as it is more or less turbulent, and
the Rivers fall stronger or more gently into the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before most part of the Coast of <i>Brasile</i> lies a Stone Cliff of above twenty or
thirty Paces broad, which is never cover’d with Water, though in the time of
Spring-floods. In this Cliff Nature in several places hath made a Gap, through
which the Ships sail near the Shore, and ride safe at an Anchor.</p>

<p class='c010'>The whole Countrey of <i>Brasile</i> is divided into thirteen <i>Præfectures</i>, or Lordships,
and hath about as many Rivers, which more or less empty themselves into
every one of these Countreys. The Eastern part hath several Brooks and Fountains,
which afford good Water both for Man and Beast. In some parts the Water
is so strong, that the wild Beasts making themselves Drunk therewith, are easily
taken. During the Winter Season the Rivers glide with great force, and swell on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>sudden, overflowing all the neighboring Countrey, onely the River <i>San Francisco</i>
runs strongest and rises highest in the Summer Season, whenas in the Winter it
flows low, and poures but little Water into the Ocean. The original of this River
is as yet unknown, yet is by most believ’d to come out of a great Lake lying
near the <i>Peruvian</i> Mountains: The <i>Hollanders</i>, who sail’d forty Leagues up the
same, found it every where broad and deep, and scatter’d full of Isles and Rocks.
The <i>Portuguese</i> sailing ten Leagues farther, discover’d the great Rocks <i>Cocoeras</i>, from
which the said River falls down with great violence, and extends it self North-West.
In the other <i>Brasilian</i> Streams, though wide at the Mouthes, which generally
are not above two or three hours walking from their Fountains or Springs, no
Barque is able to Row up, they being exceeding shallow, although much Rain
falls into them; the reason whereof is because the barren Mountains lying between
<i>Brasile</i> and <i>Peru</i>, discharge abundance of Water through the Rivers of <i>Amazones</i>,
<i>Maranon</i>, <i>Francisco</i>, <i>La Plata</i>, and the <i>Juaeiro</i>, with such force into the Ocean,
that they keep their sweetness for thirty Leagues. Near the Sea side are several
Lakes and Pits which are drinkable, and others up in the Countrey that are
brackish.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Nature of the Soil.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey differs exceedingly, for where it extends in Plains the Soil is fat
and clayie, and produces all sorts of Fruit, but especially Sugar-Canes. During
the rainy Seasons the Trees flourish most; after which the heat of the Sun, and fertility
of the Soil speedily ripen the Fruit: wherefore they Dung not their Land,
but on the contrary endeavor to make it lean with Sand, that the Plants might not
have too many Leaves, and wither before the Fruit can be ripened. They Sowe in
the beginning of the rainy Moneths, and especially take care that the Seed lie not
too deep in the Ground, because then the Sun-beams being not able to come at it,
suffer it to perish in the cold Ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>The high <i>Cocoa</i> and <i>Palmito</i>-Trees, are transplanted all the year round, the Roots
being onely cover’d with a little Earth, because they can endure no cold.</p>

<p class='c010'>Several Trees here bear a cooling Fruit, as if kind Nature took care to provide
against excessive heat.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the <i>Tamanda</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>All manner of Plants and Herbs brought hither from <i>Angola</i>, <i>Portugal</i>, the <i>Netherlands</i>,
and the <i>East-Indies</i>, grow here very plentifully. But the Countrey generally
would be much better, if some way could be found out to destroy the innumerable
company of Pismires, which though three times bigger than the <i>European</i>, resemble
them very much, and cover the Paths in Woods and Fields for three or four
Miles together; and raising Hillocks, make them hollow, and fill them with Corn:
in the Full of the Moon they gather an incredible quantity of Grain, which they
bite at each end, because it should not sprout: against the rainy Moneths they stop
up their Holes, that the Water may not damnifie their Store. But these Animals
have a mortal Enemy of the <i>Tamanda</i>, of which there are two sorts, the bigger
call’d <i>Guaca</i>; the lesser <i>Miri</i>; the <i>Guaca</i>, notwithstanding it is no bigger than an ordinary
Dog, yet it destroys Tygers, and other wild Beasts, with such a raging fury,
that it never lets go what once it hath got hold of, but holds it fast so long till sometimes
it dies of Hunger. The <i>Guaca</i> differing from the <i>Miri</i> onely in bigness,
hath a broad Tail full of grey and black Bristles, which sticks up when he is vex’d,
but when he goes to sleep, covers himself with the same. The <i>Miri</i> winds his long
smooth Tail about the Boughs, by which hanging he searches the Holes in the
Trees with his Tongue, which being thin and round, hath a Gutter in the middle,
in which when it feels any Pismires, it suddenly swallows them down: If he perceives
them to have their Nests under Ground, then he scratches up the Earth, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>puts his Tongue in at the Holes. Both the <i>Guaca</i> and <i>Miri</i> have a thick Skin, and a
broad black Streak from their Breasts on each side up half way their Bodies, and
through the black runs also a white Streak. No Beast in the World is hardier than
this, for though it fasts twelve days, and is afterwards flay’d alive, yet it will live
several hours after.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Plant <i>Manyle</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the Tree <i>Ibriptanga</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Tree <i>Tatai-iba</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Lakes in <i>Brasile</i> are for the most part overgrown with Weeds just like a
Field, yet are exceeding full of Fish and Fowl. Where the Sea runs into the Lakes,
great multitudes of Crabs are seen crawling along the Ground, and the Oysters
hang in Clusters on the Boughs of a Plant call’d <i>Manyle</i> or <i>Mangues</i>, which grow
with their Roots either near or in the Water, in such a manner, that new Bodies
still shoot from the old Roots, which prevents easie access to the chief Plant, on
whose uppermost Leaves after Sun-rising sticks very white Salt, which in the
Night, or in a cloudy Day turns to a brackish Dew. Moreover, those places where
<i>Brasile</i> rises with Hills and Mountains, are likewise very fruitful, except the barren
tops of some, which seem to kiss the Skyes; and though the fruitful Mountains
flourish in the time of the rainy Months, yet many of the Trees which grow on
them die in Summer, and their Ashes being burnt by the Inhabitants, are us’d in
stead of Dung. Some Woods extend themselves three hundred Leagues in length,
and are full of Trees, so tall, that an Arrow shot upwards falls short of the top of
them, and a Boat may be made out of the Body, which can carry a hundred and
fifty Men. On the great Boughs of these mighty Trees grow other excrescent
Shrubs after the manner of Misseltoe, which proceed from the Kernels swallow’d
and muted upon them by the Birds that light there. In some places also grow
also Sweet-wood Trees, which afford either excellent Gums or Wood to Dye with;
amongst which the chief is the <i>Ibiripitanga</i>, which yields the <i>Brasile</i> Wood, that
gives Denomination of <i>Brasile</i> to this vast Tract of Land. The Tree <i>Ibripitanga</i> is
tall and spreading, hath sad colour’d Bark full of short Thorns; the Leaves are
green, and differ in form but little from the Box-Tree Leaf; the Boughs shoot
forth other lesser, full of yellow and sweet-smelling Flowers, which falling off
are succeeded by a flat long Cod, of a dark grey colour, full of little red Pulse;
the upper part of the Tree is not good to Dye with, but onely the lower part of
the Body, which because the Tree grows far up in the Countrey, is not transportable
without much trouble. But the <i>Tatai-iba</i> grows in the Woods along the Shore;
the Bark being of an Ash-colour, invests a yellow Wood; the Leaves are sharp and
notch’d, the Fruit not unlike Mulberries, pale, juicy, and full of white Seed; the
Wood boyl’d Dyes a pure Yellow. It is observable not onely of this Tree, but
generally of the Trees of this Countrey, that they neither flourish, nor shed their
Leaves all over at once, nor do several Trees of the same kind, and growing here
germinate or fade together; for whilest one is fullest of Blossoms, the other is
without Leaves; and whilest the same Tree sheds its Leaves on one side, the other
side is newly Budded.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>European</i> Plants and Herbs with soft Roots, being once Planted in <i>Brasile</i>,
come to be hard and lignifi’d. There is also great difference, according to the
Ground in which they are Planted; for such Plants and Trees as in the Plains are
but small and tender, grow ten times higher if Planted in the Woods.</p>

<p class='c010'>All sorts of <i>Indian</i> Pulse grow higher than the tallest Trees, like high Arbors,
under which both Men and Beasts may shelter themselves from the Sun or Rain.</p>

<p class='c010'>We find not upon Record or Tradition, that <i>Brasile</i> was ever troubled with an
Earthquake, which is the reason that it hath neither Silver nor Gold-Mines, because
sulphurous Fires are found under Ground, which are a cause of the production of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>Gold and Silver, so likewise they occasion Earthquakes: yet in that part of <i>Brasile</i>
call’d <i>Ceara</i>, there are some Mines of Silver, out of which the <i>Hollanders</i> would have
got greater Riches, had not they been employ’d in the Wars against the <i>Portuguese</i>.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_558.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>Far up into the Countrey amongst the Mountains, inhabit <i>Canibals</i>, or Man-eaters.
The <i>Europeans</i> that first travell’d that way, found the Countrey very fertile and full
of People, especially in the Valleys, but somewhat incommoded by the want of
Water, and the excessiveness of the Heat in the Day, and of the Cold in the Night.
In some places the Countrey is so over-grown with Brambles, that they are forc’d
to cut their way through the same. But there are a sort of Thistles, which having
concave Leaves, receive the Dew and Rain for the accommodation of the Natives.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides Serpents and Dragons, the Tygers are most of all to be fear’d when
hungry, but once satisfi’d are easily taken.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dogs, Oxen, Sheep, and Horses thrive also exceedingly in most parts of <i>Brasile</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Nature of the <i>Brasilians</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Brasilians</i> live to be very old without being Bald or Grey: There are seldom
or never to be seen squint-ey’d, lame, decrepid, or any deformed People, notwithstanding
the Children are never Swath’d but thrown into cold Water as soon
as born. The Men generally have a very near resemblance one with another, as
also the Women, so that there is not such a difference betwixt Man and Man there,
as amongst other People. There is scarce any Sickness heard of in these Parts; for
besides a long Life, they enjoy the benefit of Health so long as they live. They
trouble not themselves with much Business; and in one Hut, whose Covering consists
of Palm-Leaves, dwell several Families together.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their manner of Living.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Their several sorts of Drinks.</div>

<p class='c010'>The general Bread of the <i>Brasilians</i> is the stamp’d Root <i>Mandihoka</i>; besides which
they also eat all manner of Fruit and Plants, and many times Flesh, which they
either eat boyl’d, broyl’d, or stew’d; their Boyling is after this manner: First
they kindle their fire with two Sticks, the one of hard, and the other of soft Wood;
the hard they make sharp at the end, and fix the same into the soft, which setting
on fire they immediately lay Cotton thereupon, or else dry Leaves, and so boyl
the Flesh in round Earthen Pots call’d <i>Camu</i>: but they account that better which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>stew’d in a Pot, the bottom whereof is cover’d with Leaves, on which they lay the
Flesh, then stopping the same close on the top with Earth and Leaves, they make
Fire over it so long till they think the Flesh to be sufficiently stew’d. Their Broyling
they perform by fixing forked Sticks into the Ground, over which they lay several
others like a Gridiron; and upon them the raw Flesh, cut in long Slices, and
Pepper’d and Salted, then make a Fire under the same till it is enough; and their
Meat so dress’d keeps good fourteen days. Their Fish either boyl’d or broyl’d is
eaten with the Sawce <i>Juquitinga</i>. The little Fish <i>Piaba</i> and <i>Piquitinga</i> they make up
in Rolls, and lay them under hot Ashes. Both with their Flesh and Fish they eat
for Bread, as hath been said, the Meal of the Root <i>Mandihoka</i>, which they taking up
with three Fingers throw into their Mouthes so dexterously, that not the least scrap
falls besides. They never observe any set hours to eat, for they make several Meals
in the Day, and sometimes in the middle of the Night, if their Appetite serves,
and neither drink nor speak whilest they are at their Meat. They sleep in spread
Hammocks made fast between two Poles, near which burns a constant Fire with
which in the Day-time they dress their Meat, and at Night keep themselves warm,
the Nights being there somewhat cold, because of their equal length with the Days.
Their usual Liquor is cold Water, taken out of the Fountains, Rivers, or Brooks;
but to Carouse they make the Drink <i>Caoi</i>, of the Fruit of the <i>Ocaiiba</i>-Tree, which
being stamp’d in a woodden Mortar, is strain’d, and at first looks like Milk, but
after a few days standing turns to a darker colour, and is strong enough to make
Astronomers of those that drink largely of it, but if long kept, it turns to be excellent
Vinegar.</p>

<p class='c010'>They have another Drink call’d <i>Aipu</i>, which is made two several ways; the
first is thus: An old Toothless Woman chews the little cut Root <i>Aipimacaxera</i> to
a Pap call’d <i>Caracu</i>, which spitting in a Pot they pour Water on the same, and afterwards
boyling it leisurely, stirring it all the time it stands over the Fire. The other
way of making this <i>Aipu</i>, which is much the more cleanly, is to boyl the said Root
so long, till it comes to be like Butter-milk, and then letting it stand till it hath
done working, it will be no unpleasant Drink.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another sort of Drink amongst them is their <i>Pacobi</i>, made of the Fruit of the
Tree <i>Pacobehe</i> and <i>Pacobucu</i>; besides others made of the Tree <i>Abatu</i>,  of <i>Indian</i> Barley
and <i>Maiz</i>. Also their Liquor call’d <i>Jetici</i> is press’d out of <i>Potato</i>-Roots.</p>

<p class='c010'>In like manner the Plant <i>Nana</i>, by the <i>Portuguese</i> call’d <i>Ananas</i>, makes the Drink
<i>Nanai</i>, which is exceeding strong and heady, but good against Faintness, Vomiting,
Gravel, and stoppage of Urine, as also against Poyson.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Deboches.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Tapuiyans</i>, sur-named <i>Cariri</i>, meet at a certain time to make the Liquor
<i>Aipu</i>, whereof each takes as much to his Hut as falls to his share, and when it hath
done working, they begin in the Morning very early at the first House in the Village,
and drink out every drop which they find there, and so from House to House
till they have drunk one another drie; and he is look’d upon to be the best Man
that hath drunk and evacuated most.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their manner of Taking Tobacco.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Brasilians</i> take generally very strong Tobacco, which they first drie in the
Sun, and afterwards before the Fire, the better to rub it in pieces: Their Tobacco-pipe
is a Cane and a hollow Nut cut off at the top, and a round Hole bor’d in the
middle, into which they put the Cane. They forbear not to take Tobacco even in
the midst of their religious Ceremonies, which are perform’d with Singing and
Dancing in this manner:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their religious Ceremonies.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Tapuiyans</i> making a round Ring at an equal distance one from another, all
of them being stark naked, tie divers colour’d Plumes of Feathers on their back-sides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>with a String made fast on their left Shoulders and about their Wastes; about
their Legs they have Cotton Garters; each in his turn bowing to the Left,
stretches down his left Hand to the Ground, and puts his right Hand in between the
Strings which tie the Plume of Feathers, and stamps continually with his right Foot,
whilest all the rest begin to Sing a doleful Song, which by degrees they change
into a merry one, not without some appearance of understanding the Art of
Musick. Their Songs contain first a mournful Relation of a general Deluge, which
drowned their Predecessors, all but some few, who escap’d by climbing up high
Trees and Mountains; next the Acts of those old Heroes from whom they boast
themselves Extracted, who lost their Lives, or valiantly fought for the publick
good, and were rewarded with the enjoyment of all pleasures and Delights, of Singing,
Playing, Dancing, and the like, in a remote Countrey, whither after their
Deaths they hope to be translated: Whilest they thus Sing over all their Songs,
three Priests stand in the middle of the Ring, each holding the Idol <i>Maraka</i> (in their
left Hand) resembling an old Ostritch’s Egg stuck full of Feathers on the top:
about their Wastes they wear a Girdle of rich Plumes, on their Heads also a Crown
of Feathers; the middle Priest looks with a stern Countenance, and holds up his
left Leg from the Ground, whilest the other two standing on each side of him, hold
in their right Hands a Pipe, out of which blowing Tobacco-smoak in one anothers
Faces, they utter these words, <i>Receive the Spirit of heroick Strength</i>: The Dance ended,
they Entertain their Priests with Meat and Drink eight days together, and also put
Meat before their Idol <i>Maraka</i>, who is the chief Deity they adore.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Arms.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Arms consist of Bowes made of hard Wood, Strung with twisted Cotton
Thred; their Arrows they make of the Cane <i>Tacaara</i>, made very sharp at the end, or
headed with some Beasts sharp Tooth, or pointed with the Bones of the Fish <i>Iperu</i>.
Some of the <i>Tapuiyans</i> use great Darts, and long Clubs of black Wood, broad before,
and full of sharp Spikes; the Handles being wound about with Cotton Strings
call’d <i>Jatirana</i>, under which hangs a Tuft of the Bird <i>Arara</i>’s Feathers, as also about
the middle. Their Trumpets, call’d <i>Canguenca</i>, are the Shin-bones of Men, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>they have others also made of great Shells and Canes. They us’d to be continually
at War one with another, which they wag’d neither for Lands nor Riches, but either
to make themselves eminent, and to be accounted valiant Soldiers, or most especially
for the sake of Man’s-flesh to feed upon, which they love beyond all things in
the World, wherefore they fatten all their Prisoners for the slaughter. Their Battels
are always cruel, for they fight very desperately. <i>Emanuel de Moraes</i> relates, That he
saw a <i>Brasilian</i> fight with three Armed <i>Portugueses</i>, who slew him not till after he had
wounded them all three.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Languages of the <i>Brasilians</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Languages of the <i>Brasilians</i> are several, each Countrey speaking a peculiar
Tongue, but so different that they cannot understand one another. The <i>Tabuyans</i>
are divided into above eighty Tribes, each speaking a peculiar Language, which
have no resemblance one with another; nevertheless they have a general Language
which is understood by most of them. The Jesuit <i>Joseph Anchieta</i> publishing
a <i>Brasilian</i> Dictionary in <i>Conimbrica</i>, <i>Anno 1595.</i> shewed that the fore-mention’d
Language wants the Letters <i>f</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>r</i>, and hath no double Consonants in any
word, except <i>mb</i>, <i>nd</i>, <i>ng</i>, so that the sound of the word falls generally on the last
Vowel. The fore-mention’d <i>Moraes</i> well experienc’d in the <i>Brasilian</i> Tongue, writ
an Alphabet of all the most familiar words thereof us’d in common Discourse, of
which it will not be unnecessary to give this following Extract:</p>

the <i>Potigi-iguaras</i> exceed all the other <i>Brasilians</i>: They place twenty or thirty
Singers in a Row, which observing Time, Sing the Transactions of their Predecessors
with good Voices.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Waimoores</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Waimoores</i> are a strong People that inhabit the large Tract of Land between
<i>Bahia</i> and <i>Isleos</i>, and having well timber’d Bodies, can keep pace with a Horse running
full speed. Five or six of them often set upon a Sugar-Mill, though a hundred
Men be at work in the same: They are all over bedaub’d with Dirt, because
they lie like Beasts on the Ground: They wear long Hair, and have no certain
Abodes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Tomonimenos</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>The <i>Tomonimenos</i>, living about <i>Spirito Santo</i>, are more civilis’d; they make Walls
of Stone about their Huts; and these Walls are full of Holes, through which they
shoot Arrows at those that Invade them; their Bodies are Painted red and black,
and cover’d with Feathers. The <i>Portuguese</i> taking sixteen thousand of them Prisoners
at once, kill’d most of them, and destroy’d the Countrey all along the River
<i>Paraiva</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Waitaquazes</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>At the South and North Point of <i>Cape Frio</i> dwell the <i>Waitaquazes</i>, bigger and
stronger than the <i>Waimoores</i>; and they also sleep like Hogs on the Ground about a
Fire, hold all People for their Enemies, and their Flesh for the greatest Dainty.
The Women Arm’d with Bowes and Arrows stand by their Husbands in Battel.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Wainasses</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Description of the Plant <i>Vruca</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>On <i>Isla Grande</i> reside the <i>Wainasses</i>, a little People, which have very long Bellies,
go stark naked, shave the Crown of their Heads, and let the other part of their
Hair hang down long on their Shoulders. The Women, which are of gross Bodies,
colour themselves Red with <i>Vruca</i>, which is a wild Plant, but much us’d amongst
them: the Kernels are inclos’d in Husks full of red Fibres. These Kernels
are not onely mix’d with the other Ingredients of the <i>Chocaletta</i> Drink, but also us’d
to Dye of a red Colour: The Wood of this Plant is very white, and the Bark grey,
like the Hazle; the Leaves being of a deep Green, resemble a Heart; at the end of
the Boughs grow several Blossoms, each as big as a Rose, consisting of five Leaves,
partly red and partly white, in the middle whereof are yellowish Threds with purple
Points, which give little or no smell: after the Flower follows the Fruit, two
Fingers long; when it begins to be ripe it grows still redder and redder, each Cod
containing thirty or forty round Kernels, which being touch’d leave a red tincture
upon the Fingers; the Cod when ripe opens of it self, and shews the Kernels
speckled white, which dry’d, pounded, and mix’d with Piss, Dye so strong a Red,
that Linnen dipt into the same will never receive any other Colour. This Root
also boyl’d in Broth, makes it not onely red, but gives it a pleasant taste.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Topinaques</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Topinaques</i>, which dwell about <i>St. Vincent</i>, are a strong and gross People, go
stark naked both Men and Women: when they kill any of their Enemies they
Paint themselves with the Fruit <i>Janipano</i>, put a great Plume of Feathers on their
Head, and two Sticks in their Mouths, Dancing with strange motions of the Body,
inclining sometimes towards the right, and sometimes towards the left side, for
three day together; during which time they drink a filthy kind of Liquor. The
Women, who have well proportion’d Bodies, onely covering their Heads with a
Cap, about which they tie a bread of Hair, to which a square Basket being fastned,
hangs below their Backs when they travel.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Pories</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Mountains along the Ocean, which inclose much Gold, are inhabited by
the <i>Pories</i>, a peaceable People, molesting none of their Neighbors; they sleep in
Nets of Flags, and have no other Houses than three Poles plac’d triangular, and
cover’d with Palm-Leaves; they feed on Pine-Nuts and <i>Eyrires</i>, Apples that have
Shells like a Walnut, and have also the precious Balsam-Oyl in great abundance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Molopaques</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Along the River <i>Paradiva</i> inhabit the <i>Molopaques</i>; the Men strong and well
timber’d, have Beards long enough to cover their Privities. The Women also fair,
modest, prudent, and never laughing, tie their Hair, painted with several colours,
round about their Middle with a Cord, so that it serves in stead of an Apron. They
observe a set-hour for Dinner and Supper, which is not us’d by any other <i>Brasilians</i>.
The Mountains in these Parts consisting of a black Mold, have plenty of
Gold, but it is of no esteem or regard amongst them, onely that which is wash’d
down by the Rain they gather up, but put to no other use than to make Hooks to
hang their Nets on.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Waianawasons</i> have little Villages, built along a nameless River; they are a
Gigantick People, but very ignorant. Thirteen <i>Portuguese</i> undertaking some years
ago to travel through this Countrey to the South Sea, found on some Mountains
abundance of Gold and Precious Stones; and amongst many strange things they
saw a Crystal Mountain ten days before they came near it, over which they could
not travel because of its steepness; at the foot thereof sprung a broad Stream, making
a great noise. From thence travelling forward, they came to the <i>Tamoyes</i>
Countrey, the Men whereof, being well proportion’d, wore great Bunches of Feathers
on their Heads: The Women, exceeding fair, had carv’d Breasts. The said
<i>Portuguese</i> being taken here, were put into Prison, and all slain and eaten, excepting
one, who escap’d after this manner: Thirty thousand <i>Tamoyes</i> falling into the
Countrey of the <i>Amazons</i>, by the <i>Americans</i> call’d <i>Mandiocuysyams</i>, made a great Feast
with three hundred of them, whilest the rest fled to the River <i>La Plata</i>, where they
got help from the <i>Portuguese</i>, who kill’d ten thousand of the <i>Tamoyes</i>, made the rest
Slaves, and releas’d their imprison’d Countreyman.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Tocomans</i>, <i>Caryogs</i>, and <i>Maraquites</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Caryogs</i> possess much Gold and Precious Stones.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Maraquites</i>, by the Western <i>Indians</i> sur-named <i>Tapuiyers</i>, that is, <i>Wild People</i>,
are divided into seventy six sorts, all differing in their Languages; amongst which
the chiefest are the <i>Arodera</i>, <i>Cajau</i>, <i>Maquaru</i>, and <i>Poyme</i>, which all live without Law,
Religion, setled Abodes, or Friendship with any Neighbors; and the Women
Fight as well as the Men. <i>Jacob Rabbi</i>, who dwelt a considerable time, and convers’d
amongst these People, describes their Customs thus:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Customs describ’d.</div>

<p class='c010'>“Their King <i>Jandui</i>, sir-named <i>Otshicayayna</i>, from the River which flows through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>the Countrey of the <i>Tapuyans</i>, causes (it he thinks fit) to be publish’d through
the whole Camp of the Enemy, whither he will go the next Morning, and what
he will do all the Day following, having first consulted with his Council of
Sorcerers. Before they march they wash their Bodies in the River; rub themselves
all over with Sand, and afterwards wash it off again, then stretch themselves
till all their Joynts crack, run to the Fire, and when throughly warm,
scratch their Bodies with certain Fish-Teeth, insomuch that the Blood gushes
out of several places, all which they judge to be good against wearisomness.
About a Stones-cast from the King’s Tent lie two thick Logs, a large Stride one
from the other, against which the whole Multitude stand divided into two Parties,
each of whom chuse the strongest Man accounted amongst them to carry
the Log for a Wager, and when these two are tir’d, they are releas’d by others,
and he that comes last to the appointed place with the Log, is laugh’d at by the
Party to which he belong’d that was there first, where they all stay for the Youths
that bring their Arms, which when they have deliver’d, they all fall to work,
cutting down Trees, breaking off the Boughs, sticking them in the Ground, and
tying them together on the top for Tents, which are built in rows one against
another, leaving a broad Path between. Mean while the Women and Children
coming with their Baggage, the Men run to Fish and Hunt, or to seek Honey.
The old Women dig up Roots, which stamp’d serve them for Bread, whilest the
young Women help one another to prepare the Meat in the Huts. Moreover the
Men spend their time in several Exercises, as Wrestling and Running, of which
two Women, appointed for that purpose, are the Judges. When the Evening
draws on upon them, then the Youths dividing themselves into Companies, go
Singing from one Tent to another, and are follow’d by the Maids Dancing and
Leaping, every one standing behind him whom she loves best; and this is look’d
upon as a singular sign of affection. When a young Man is inclin’d to Marry,
he carries Honey and Venison to his Mistresses Father, who if he hath more than
one Daughter acquaints the Soothsayers with it, who inform the King concerning
it; he then causes all the young Men and Maids to be call’d together out of
the Camp, sends them into the Woods to Hunt out a wild Beast, which they no
sooner see, but they return and acquaint the Multitude therewith, who immediately
surrounding the Place, soon catch the Beast, whose Entrails they pull out
and throw to the Dogs, and give the Flesh to the Women to roast, which
when ready they make merry with, Singing and Dancing after they have
eaten; then if the Youth hath behav’d himself well in pursuing of the wild
Beast, the King grants him the Maid which he desires for his Wife: Four days
before the Wedding they bore a Hole through each of the Bridegrooms Cheeks
with a sharp piece of Wood, which done they solemnize the Marriage; at which
the King himself distributes the Meat to every Guest as he thinks fit; after Dinner
they extol the Mothers Care, in preserving her Daughters Virginity for the
Bridegroom in strange Songs. If a Maid be Marriageable, and no Suitor comes
to her, then the Mother draws red Strokes under her Eyes, and conducts her to
the King, who sets the Maid down by him on a Mat, warms his Hands against
the Fire, then stroaks himself and the Maid, and also blows Tobacco-Smoak on
her and himself, which done, he performs the part of a Husband with her. But
their making Holes through their Ears and Lips is done whilest they are Children,
after this manner: The Boys who undergo this Ceremony, come to the
Place appointed, where the whole Multitude Dance and Sing, and the Conjurers
(who are the onely Priests they have) sit in two rows opposite to one another;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>one of them starting up, takes a Boy by the Head, ties him Hand and Foot
that he cannot stir at all; which done, a second Sorcerer comes to his assistance,
and with a sharp-pointed Stick bores Holes through his Ears and Lips, whilest
the Mother of the Boy makes a sad Lamentation. Women refuse to have any
familiarity with their Husbands as soon as they perceive themselves to be with
Child; and as soon as any Woman is Deliver’d, she runs into a neighboring
Wood, where with a Shell she cuts off the Childs Navel, which boyling she eats
with the After-birth; then washes her self and the Child every Morning and
Evening in cold Water; as long as she gives Suck her Husband lies not with
her, unless it be a Man that hath but one Wife. If a Woman commit Adultery,
her Husband beats her out of his House, but if he takes her in the Act, it is lawful
for him to kill both. In the middle of the King’s Tent stands a great <i>Calabash</i>
full of Stones call’d <i>Kehnturah</i>, cover’d with the corner of a Mat, which none
dares approach without the King’s leave, unless it be to smoak the same with
Tobacco, or to lay Venison or Honey before it.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange manner of curing the Sick amongst the <i>Tapuyans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>It is also remarkable how the Sorcerers deal with their Sick; the aforesaid <i>Jacob
Rabbi</i>, in Eye-witness relates, That the King <i>Drarugh</i> being extreamly troubled
with pains in his Sides and Legs, and finding no help amongst his Sorcerers, who
pretended to be Physicians, went to the neighboring King of the <i>Tapuyans</i>, where three
undertook to cure him, which they did after this manner: One of them blew Tobacco-smoak
on his Body, suck’d his Knees, roar’d like a Lyon, and after much
ado vomited a little Eel into his Hand, which he pretended had put the King to
so much pain; whilest the second suck’d his Belly, and also roar’d exceedingly, and
vomited forth at last a Stone, on which appear’d a Rose; the third suck’d his left
Side, till he vomited something like a Root; after which the King is said immediately
to have recover’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Feasting in honor of the Stars.</div>

<p class='c010'>There is but little Ceremony of Religion to be found amongst the <i>Tapuyans</i>, onely
they shew Reverence to the Seven-stars when the Fruits of the Field are ripe, after
this manner: First they spend three days in Dancing and Singing, then the Youths
prepare themselves to Fight with Lances and Clubs, tie tough Twigs about their
Legs, pour Honey on their Heads, tie their Hair behind in Knots after it is powder’d
with red Powder, Paint their Faces and Bodies with several Colours, stick a
long Feather in their Necks betwixt their Hair, and on their Heads set Garlands of
red Feathers pleited, down their Backs hang Bundles of Branches like Tails, and
have their Arms adorn’d with the Wings of the Bird <i>Kosetug</i>; thus dress’d they
fight three days, at the end whereof the Conquerors shew great joy.</p>

<p class='c010'>It deserves special observation what the Learned <i>Gerard Vossius</i> relates of them
from the Mouth of <i>Christopher Arcisseusky</i>, a <i>Polish</i> Nobleman, famous for his heroick
Exploits for the <i>United Netherlands</i> in <i>Brasile</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Arcisseusky</i>’s Relation of the Manners of the new Married.</div>

<p class='c010'>“The <i>Tapuyans</i> (saith he) are a People that range up and down, never staying
long in one place, between <i>Siara</i> and <i>Meranthon</i>, a vast Tract of Land, and go almost
naked, having onely a slight Covering about their Middle. When the <i>Hollanders</i>
gave them Clothes, they admir’d the strange Fashion thereof, and after
two days return’d them again: In their Lips, Nostrils, Ears and Cheeks they
hung Ornamentals of Wood, Bones, Feathers, or Stones; a great Club, and a
strong Bowe made of hard Wood serve them for Arms; Gold and Silver they
esteem’d not, wherefore they barter’d whole Chests full (buried there by the <i>Portuguese</i>
and discover’d by them) with the <i>Hollanders</i> for Greyhounds: They judge
themselves to be better than other Man-eaters, because they eat not the Flesh of
their Enemies, but of their own Relations, and those neither kill’d in the Wars,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>nor dying a natural Death; by which they pretend to express their exceeding love
to the Deceased, who else would, say they, be eaten by the Worms and rot,
wherefore they rather chuse to eat them, that they may receive the nourishment
themselves.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_568.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>The same Author relates also, That he saw a <i>Tapuyan</i> yield up the Ghost not far
from the Castle <i>Rio Grande</i>, after which his nearest Relations taking the Body,
wash’d the same, together with the Entrails, and cutting the Corps into several
pieces, roasted the same on a Spit, preserving the Fat that dropt from it in Pans,
and eat the Flesh with a greedy Appetite. None were admitted to this Feast but
his chief Relations; and that which they could not eat, as the Hair, Teeth, Nails,
and Bones, they burnt to Ashes, which gathering up they mix’d with their Liquor
till it was all drunk up.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Religion of the <i>Tapuyans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Tapuyans</i> acknowledge two Deities, the one good and the other bad; to
the good they shew no Reverence, because, say they, he is bountiful of himself, and
doth them no hurt; whereas on the contrary they zealously call upon their Devil-Deity,
because they think he destroys all those who worship him not.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their foretelling of things to come.</div>

<p class='c010'>They never Travel nor go to War before they have consulted with their angry
God, and that not without great Ceremonies; whereupon they ascribe to themselves
the knowledge of future things; and indeed they often foretel future things
which are beyond humane apprehension; as a testimony whereof that may serve
which <i>Sapo Amama</i>, a <i>Friezland</i> Gentleman, found by experience: for he keeping
Guard before <i>Conjahu</i> with a Troop of Horse against the <i>Portuguese</i>, had several <i>Tapuyans</i>
in his Service, who foretold, That the following day the Lieutenant <i>Amama</i>
and a Trooper should be kill’d by a Shot from a great Gun; which, though slighted,
was confirm’d by the exact fulfilling of the Prediction. The like Passages hapned
daily, and amongst many <i>Arcisseusky</i> relates one very remarkable Accident, <i>viz.</i>
He remov’d a considerable number of Men of the Garrison <i>Rio Grande</i>, to surprize
the <i>Spanish</i> Fort <i>Barra-Canium</i>, and nothing could more promote the Design
than secrecy; but fifty <i>Tapuyans</i> having joyn’d with the <i>Hollanders</i>, <i>Arcisseusky</i> fear’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>they might discover his Plot, wherefore he charg’d them that they should not stir a
foot from his Company, which they accordingly promis’d, and having march’d
three days through By-ways, they daily perform’d their Devotion in open view,
and <i>Arcisseusky</i> desir’d that they would call him when their Devil appear’d, which
they granted, on promise that he should not do him any hurt: On the third day
the Army being sufficiently refresh’d, he being call’d, found the <i>Tapuyans</i> sitting in
a Semi-Circle, with their Feet spread asunder; opposite to them sat their Priest
on the Ground, whom they ask’d concerning all manner of Affairs, and he question’d
them again, on which they gave their several Answers, but could not be understood
for want of Interpreters, for those whom the <i>Hollanders</i> us’d spake only two
Languages, one of which is us’d commonly by the <i>Brasilians</i> along the Sea-Coast,
and the other by the <i>Portuguese</i>, in which they Interpreted to the <i>Hollanders</i> as much
as possibly they could understand of what the <i>Tapuyans</i> said, whose Language differs
very much from the vulgar <i>Brasile</i> Tongue, because they live up in the Inland,
and are divided into divers Tribes, so that the Interpreters could not understand
the <i>Tapuyans</i>, but judg’d their meaning more by nodding of the Head, and the like
signs: after the Assembly had done speaking, the Priest rose up and went out of
their sights into the Wood, where with a loud voice he call’d three times upon the
Devil; but he not answering, the Priest return’d to his Company, who began
their Questions and Answers afresh, which could not be understood by the Interpreters;
and soon after the Priest (seeming to be commanded by the rest) went
again to the Wood, but calling still in vain, return’d; then going a third time, and
calling as before, was by a small, but shrill Voice, answer’d from the middle of
the Wood, from which the <i>Tapuyans</i> concluded that their Business would come to
perfection, and that the Devil would soon appear to them: The Priest hereupon
going backwards and forwards three times one after another to his Company,
they began to talk as before; at last going into the Wood again, they all spoke
louder, and with more vehemency than before, whilest the fore-mention’d shrill
Voice approached nearer and nearer, and at last the supposed <i>Dæmon</i> came forth with
the Priest, who commanded him to sit opposite to the Congregation, which had
a great deal of Discourse, and sometimes the Priest speaking was answer’d by
the Devil in his shrill Voice; but some of the People calling aloud, catch’d up
their Arms, and threatned to beat the Devil, as they often us’d to do upon the like
occasions. At the departure of the <i>Dæmon</i>, the Multitude conducted by the Priest
into the Wood, cry’d out in so terrible a manner, that they affrighted the <i>Hollanders</i>,
who judg’d it rather to be Lyons and Tygers that roar’d than Men. During
these Transactions, a <i>German</i> Soldier in the Rere quitted his Arms and fled, but
being miss’d was pursu’d, found in a Hedge, and laid Hold on as a Person suspected
to carry Advice to the <i>Spaniards</i>, and being brought before <i>Arcisseusky</i> and Examined,
gave such ridiculous Answers as increas’d the suspicion, insomuch that he
was led to a Tree to be tortur’d; where as he stood ty’d he solemnly declar’d, That
the reason of his running away, was because he had not Pray’d in ten years, so that
he was exceedingly afraid, lest when he saw the Devil amongst the <i>Tapuyans</i>, he
would have known him, and carry’d him away to the Place prepar’d for all such
Wretches.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Imposture.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Learned <i>Gerard Vossius</i> made a particular Enquiry after this Story, whether
the Spirit’s appearance were a Reality, or an Imposture; and the truth is it was no
better than a subtile Cheat, and so it was apprehended by <i>Arcisseusky</i>, who not long
after, on a convenient time, ask’d the <i>Tapuyans</i> why they feign’d him to be a Devil
that was a Man, whom he had often seen before? which they denying, affirm’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>that it was a real Devil; but <i>Arcisseusky</i> knew their pretended Friend, who spake so
shrill by reason of a Grass-blade which he held in his Mouth. However, though
the main of the Fable was acted by Man, yet the Devil without doubt play’d his
part with them, as appear’d by those Predictions, which no Man could possibly
know, <i>viz.</i> That the <i>Portuguese</i> Fort should with the loss but of three Men fall into
the <i>Hollanders</i> hands; for so accordingly it hapned. But because the Devil cannot
foresee all things, therefore they often erre; for they said that the <i>Hollanders</i>
should cross the Moat on Boards nail’d together in stead of a Bridge, and that the
Enemy should not perceive it; and indeed <i>Arcisseusky</i> had resolv’d so to do, but
was discover’d by the <i>Portuguese</i>, who defended themselves with great Guns, which
so affrighted the <i>Tapuyans</i>, not us’d to such a noise, that they ran away and never
return’d, so that by Morning the Fort was conquer’d, and all things quieted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A pleasant Story between <i>Arcisseusky</i> and a <i>Tapuyan</i> Priest.</div>

<p class='c010'>After this <i>Arcisseusky</i> burnt several <i>Portuguese</i> Ships in the River <i>Monguoape</i>, and
kept one, carrying ten Demi-Culverins, laden with Sugar and <i>Spanish</i> Wine; which
to carry to a safe Harbor a short Way, he requir’d the <i>Tapuyans</i> assistance; but
they refus’d to enter, pretending the Ship would perish by some or other unfortunate
Accident, which accordingly hapned as they had said; for the Ship was split
against a Rock in the Mouth of a narrow Haven, insomuch that nothing of it was
sav’d; all which the <i>Tapuyans</i> knew beforehand by the Devil’s information, for they
never go upon any Business of consequence before they have consulted with him,
and done him worship. Yet, it seems, they cannot secure this Devil of theirs
from the Stripes of a Mortal, as appears by this pleasant Story: A <i>Tapuyan</i> Priest
was promis’d a Shirt from <i>Arcisseusky</i>, upon condition the Devil should pull the
same out of his Hand and carry it up in the Air: The <i>Tapuyan</i> liking the Proposal,
promis’d immediately to call the Devil; but when <i>Arcisseusky</i> desir’d leave to Drub
him with a Stick which he had in his Hand, he could by no means perswade
the Priest to call for his <i>Dæmon</i>; at which every one began to laugh: and to carry
on the Mirth farther, <i>Arcisseusky</i> Joking with the Priest, said, <i>I will shew you that I am
a greater Artist than you, for to Morrow I will bring it about by my Art, that great Horns shall
grow on your Head, so big, that you shall not be able to pass these Doors</i>; which so affrighted
the <i>Tapuyans</i>, that all of them fled, onely the Priest return’d the next day
with an Interpreter to <i>Arcisseusky</i>, desiring him that he would use him mercifully,
and not cause any Horns to grow on his Head.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the time when <i>Jacob Rabbi</i> convers’d amongst the <i>Tapuyans</i>, they were Govern’d
by <i>Janduy</i>, a Man of above a hundred years old, whose chief Seat was on
each side of the River <i>Otschunogh</i>, and round about the Lake <i>Igtug</i>, in which none
durst Swim, because of the many biting Fishes in the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>The King <i>Pritigaba</i> having entred into a strict League with <i>Janduy</i>, Warr’d continually
against the Kings <i>Arygpoygh</i>, <i>Wanasewasug</i>, <i>Tshering</i>, and <i>Dremenige</i>; and had
not the <i>Portuguese</i> taken the four last into their Service to aid them against the <i>Hollanders</i>,
they could never have held out long against the Forces sent by <i>Janduy</i>, who
destroy’d Man, Beast, and Houses, sparing nothing they met with; for they murther
and destroy all things where e’re they come.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Brasile</i> by whom possess’d at present.</div>

<p class='c010'>The several Nations that now possess <i>Brasile</i>, besides its native Inhabitants, are
<i>Portuguese</i>, <i>English</i>, <i>Hollanders</i>, <i>Germans</i>, and <i>French</i>, which the <i>Brasilians</i> by a general
Name call <i>Ajuru-juba</i>; otherwise they call all Strangers <i>Caraiba</i> or <i>Pero</i>. But from
the commixing of several Nations proceeds a fifth sort, for one that is born of <i>European</i>

found great resistance; and had not the Natives been at Wars amongst themselves,
they could never have got so much footing, but now they are sufficiently Masters;
for they have either slain all the old Inhabitants, or driven them up into the Inland:
However, the <i>Brasilians</i> are so valiant, that they will Encounter a great Army, being
brought up in the Wars from their Cradle. When they Engage one with another
they shoot their Arrows exceeding thick, Hooting, Hollowing, and Leaping
from one side to the other to shun the Arrows with a wonderful dexterity: The
Conquerors spare none, but kill all, and Feast on the slain Bodies; but some they
hale away Prisoners with a Rope about their Necks, to each of whom they allot
a young Maid, who cherishes and fattens them up for five Moneths, at the end of
which they make a great Feast, and drink to a pitch beyond Sense or Reason, having
first fill’d their Bellies with the Flesh of the slain Prisoners roasted. If the Woman
be got with Child by the Slain, they imagine that they can take no greater revenge
of their Enemy, than to devour the Child as soon as it comes into the World; but
it often happens, that the Woman really loving her Husband the Prisoner, runs
away with him, and so bereaves her Friends of a Banquet.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First Discovery and Possession of <i>Rio de Janeiro</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The second Lordship <i>Rio de Janeiro</i>, formerly by the <i>French</i> call’d <i>Ganabara</i>,
was discover’d <i>Anno 1515.</i> by <i>Juan Dias de Solis</i>; but the <i>French</i> first Setled
themselves here forty years after <i>Dias de Solis</i>: for setting Sail from <i>Havre
de Grace</i> with three well Mann’d Ships, Commanded by <i>Nicholas Durandus Villegagnon</i>,
they arriv’d at <i>Rio Janeiro</i> in <i>November</i>, and at the Entrance into the River,
which is about half a League broad, built a woodden Fort of a hundred Foot long,
and sixty broad, and giving it the Name of the <i>French</i> Admiral <i>Coligni</i>, put several
Guns into the same to secure the Entrance, inclos’d on each side by two steep Mountains.
In the River, which is very broad, lie several wooddy Isles, on one of which,
near the Fort <i>Coligni</i>, <i>Villegagnon</i> Setling himself, suffer’d great Inconveniences for
want of Water, because he durst not Land on the Main, for fear of being surpris’d by
the Natives. Here he stay’d a year and a half in a deplorable Condition, when
<i>Philip Corguileray</i> and <i>Du Pont</i> set Sail with three Ships from the Haven <i>Honfleurs</i>;
but they also, though they had many Men, yet were ill stor’d with Provisions, insomuch
that Hunger increas’d amongst them daily: wherefore <i>Villegagnon</i> return’d
home without any farther Exploits.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Jean Leri</i> his Description thereof.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Jean Leri</i>, who went with <i>Corguileray</i>, describes <i>Rio Janeiro</i> after this manner:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The River (saith he) lies twenty three Degrees Southward of the <i>Equinoctial
Line</i>; the Inlet of the Sea, twenty four thousand Paces broad, and in some places
broader, is hemm’d in by hills; the Mouth of the Inlet is somewhat dangerous,
by reason of three rocky Isles; beyond the large Bay is a narrow Channel, on the
left-hand whereof there rises a high Mountain, which the <i>French</i> call’d <i>Le
Pot de Beure</i>, because it resembles a Butter-pot. Somewhat farther lies the Rock
<i>Ratier</i>, where <i>Villegagnon</i> thought to build a Fort, but the Water in stormy Weather
washing over the Rock, he was forc’d to give over his Design. Half a League
farther is an Island a thousand Paces in length, and a hundred and fifty in breadth,
surrounded with Rocks, on which the <i>French</i> resided: at each end of the Isle rises
a Hill, and from the middle a Rock sixty Foot high; on the Hill <i>Villegagnon</i> pitcht
his Tent till he had built him a handsom House on a Rock; the other Houses were
built in the Valley. Three Leagues and a half farther lies a fruitful Isle nine
Miles in circumference, inhabited by a salvage People call’d <i>Touoebinambauti</i>:
there are several other Isles, on which breed good Oysters with little Pearls,
which stick so fast to great Stones, that they can scarce be pluckt off. The River
<i>Janeiro</i> abounds with Fish.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and Places of chief note.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>French</i> once possess’d this Island, but were dispossess’d by <i>Emanuel de Sa</i>,
Governor of <i>Brasile</i>, for the <i>Portuguese</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The City <i>Sebastian</i>, which contains three hundred Houses, is built on the Southern
Point of <i>Janeiro</i>; opposite to which, on the Northern Point, lies the Fort;
a large Church, the <i>Jesuits</i> Cloyster, and two Sugar-Mills, give no small lustre to
the City, where the chief Trade consists in <i>Brasile</i> Wood and Cotton. The <i>French</i>
Storm’d this Town <i>Anno 1581.</i> but march’d off without any success. <i>Dirk Ruiters</i>,
an Eye-witness, gives us this Description of <i>Sebastian</i>:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>“The Town (says he) lies two Leagues up the River <i>Janeiro</i>, in a Bay, about
which it is built like a Semi-Circle in a sandy Soil along the Water, and is about
a Mile long; at each end rise steep Mountains, besides which it hath neither
Walls nor Gates; but its strength consists of four Forts, the chiefest whereof
stands towards the East on a Rock in the Mouth of the River; the second towards
the West, an Isle which on the South-East rises with a Mountain resembling
a Sugar-Loaf: the third crowns a Rock South-East from the Town; and
the fourth, in the North-West, a high Mountain. The Natives, call’d <i>Tououpinambauti</i>,
are very serviceable to the <i>Portuguese</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides the fore-mention’d Towns <i>Coligni</i> and <i>St. Sebastian</i>, some make mention
of another in this <i>Præfecture</i>, call’d <i>Angra de los Reyes</i>, twelve Leagues distant from
<i>St. Sebastian</i> Westward.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Burroughs of the Natives are populous, but neither strong by Nature, nor

<div class='sidenote'>Several strange sorts of Fish.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Next to <i>Rio Janeiro</i> lies the Lordship or County <i>De Spirito Sancto</i>, exceeding
fruitful, having divers Woods abounding with Venison. The Rivers
<i>Parayva</i>, <i>Manangea</i>, <i>Itapemeri</i>, <i>Iritibi</i>, and <i>Guarapari</i>, are stor’d with all sorts
of Fish, and amongst others the Fish <i>Piratiapua</i>, which in the Winter Moneths lives
in the Rivers, and against the Summer returns to the Rocks wash’d by the Ocean.
This Fish hath a wide Mouth full of Teeth, a reddish Tongue, little Fins, except
those on their Backs, divers colour’d Scales, yet most of a dark Red, and generally
weighs fifty Pound.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here is also the Fish <i>Paru</i>, full of yellow Scales like Half-Moons over a black
Skin; it hath long Fins near the Tail, and a little Head.</p>

<p class='c010'>No less remarkable is the <i>Guebucu</i>, which hath a long Body, a sharp bonie Snout,
the upper Jaw reaching over the other, no Teeth, a Tail divided in the middle,
sharp Fins on the Back, and a Skin full of Silver-colour’d Prickles. This Monster
not onely devours great Fishes, but also Men; when it is hungry it often runs its
Snout through the side of a Ship.</p>

<p class='c010'>But there is no Fish more deform’d than the <i>Abacatuaja</i>, which being oval and
flat, hath two long Fins underneath, and one on the top, a divided Tail, green
Fins, a smooth Skin, and fiery Eyes; as soon as it is taken it cries like a Hog.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Serpent <i>Boiguacu</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>In this County stands a Town of the same Denomination, which contains two
hundred Houses, a Sugar-Mill, and a Cloyster of <i>Jesuits</i>, and drives a great Trade
in Cotton and <i>Brasile</i> Wood. Before the City lies an Inlet full of Isles, the Mouth
of which is guarded by a Castle. The Natives, call’d <i>Maigaias</i>, are in League with
the <i>Portuguese</i>, but the <i>Tapuyans</i> and <i>Apiapetangas</i> do them all the mischief they can
possibly; so that the <i>Portuguese</i> travel in great danger of their lives, when any Business
calls them, through the Countrey of these salvage People. But besides these
People, the Way is pester’d with strange wild Beasts, especially on the Mountain
<i>Mestre Alvaro</i>, which is seen at a great distance off at Sea; on which, amongst other
Creatures, breeds the terrible Serpent <i>Boiguacu</i>, whose length is generally twenty
four Foot; it is of an Ash colour, with great and small black Spots, with a little
white Speck in the middle; when hungry, it leaps out of the Hedges, or from the
tops of Trees, raises it self upright on its Tail, and winding about either Man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>Beast, or whate’re it be, squeezes it to death, or puts its Tail, which ends in a sharp
Point or Sting, in at the Fundament in such a manner, that it kills the Creature on
which it seizeth in a moment, and then swallows it up. This Serpent hath strong
Ribs inwardly, and more than seventy bonie Joynts; wherefore it turns it self
with great ease; the Joynt-bones near the Head are the biggest, and grow smaller
and smaller towards the Tail: It also feeds on Pismires.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Bird <i>Jabicu-guacu</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>This County also breeds the Bird <i>Jabicu-guacu</i>, which exceeds the Crane in bigness,
and hath a long thick Bill, but no Tongue; on his Head appears a white grisly
Crest or Mitre; the Wings and Tail are short, and the Feathers most of them white,
except the Pinions, which shine like Rubies; their Flesh is of a good rellish, but
somewhat dry.</p>

there. The Town, built on the top of a white Rock, gives its Denomination to

<div class='sidenote'>Remakable Wreck of the Ship <i>Batavia</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Corneliszoon</i>: his villainous Attempt.</div>

<p class='c010'>On this Coast the Ship <i>Batavia</i> was cast away <i>Anno 1629.</i> which Accident is the
more remakable for the Murders committed by the Factor, <i>Hieronymus Corneliszoon</i>,
who with some Confederates resolv’d to run away with the Ship, and to Sail
to some <i>Spanish</i> Haven, or <i>Dunkirk</i>, and so to pillage the <i>Netherland</i> Vessels; but their
Design was frustrated by the Ships running against the <i>Abrolhos</i>: <i>Francis Pelsaert</i>,
chief Commander, first caus’d the Sick, with the Women and Children, to be put
on an Island, or else on two Rocks about three Leagues distant from the place
where the Ship lay, in which remain’d seventy Men, whom <i>Pelsaert</i> in vain endeavor’d
to carry away; for the Sea was so rough that a Boat was not able to abide
in the same, and also the Storm beginning to increase, beat the Ship more and more
against the Sands, and the Seamen venturing towards the Isle on pieces of Timber,
were some drown’d, others by the Waves, were driven ashore, amongst whom was
<i>Hieronymus Corneliszoon</i>, who preserv’d his Life twenty four hours on the Boltsprit
after the Ship was stav’d; but not terrifi’d with such an Accident, he continu’d in
his fore-mention’d Resolution. On one of the Cliffs were forty Persons with
eighty Cans of Water, but on the Island a hundred and eighty with much less;
upon which <i>Pelsaert</i>, who when the Storm ceas’d, thought to save somewhat more
out of his Wrack, was necessitated to seek for fresh Water on one of the said Cliffs,
but not finding enough, trimm’d up his Boat and set Sail homeward, from thence to
fetch a new supply of People: During which time <i>Cornelisszoon</i> perform’d his Vilany;
for he chose <i>David</i> of <i>Zeevang</i>, <i>Gysbrecht Welderen</i>, <i>Coenraed Huissen</i>, <i>Cornelis Pieterszoon</i>,
<i>Rutger Frederickszoon</i>, and <i>Hans Heilwerk</i>, for his Assistants, besides several
others, and destroy’d all the People on the Island, except five, who escap’d on pieces
of Timber to the Rock where <i>Weyber Hays</i> resided with forty Men, who being
inform’d what the aforesaid Villains had done, prepar’d for resistance with sharp-pointed
Sticks, those People on the second Rock being also slain by <i>Zeevang</i>, who
spared onely some Women and seven Boys; after which <i>Hieronymus Corneliszoon</i> took
<i>Lucretia Jans</i> for his Wife; in like manner <i>Huissen</i> took <i>Judith Sebastiaens</i>; the remaining
Women serv’d the rest for Concubines. Not long after twenty of them going
in Sloops, fell upon <i>Weiber Hays</i>, who valiantly resisted them: but because <i>Hays</i>’s
Life was of great consequence, by reason he might give notice of their Actions
to the Ship which was expected from <i>Holland</i>, and which they design’d to run away
with, therefore they renew’d their Assault with fifteen Men more, and were again
beat off; wherefore they resolv’d to make a Peace, which <i>Hieronymus Corneliszoon</i>
promis’d to ratifie the next day; nevertheless this Peace was but feigned, for
under pretence thereof they deliver’d Letters to several <i>French</i> Soldiers that were
under <i>Hays</i>’s Command, promising each six thousand <i>Guilders</i> if they would joyn
with them; but they shew’d the Letters to <i>Hays</i>, who keeping it secret, that he
might draw on <i>Hieronymus Corneliszoon</i>, not mistrusting the Discovery, to come thither
at the appointed time, took him Prisoner, and caus’d <i>Zeevang</i>, <i>Huissen</i>, <i>Welderen</i>,
and <i>Cornelis Pieterszoon</i> to be put to death; but <i>Wouter Loos</i> making his escape,
was chosen chief of the Rebels, who ventur’d a fourth Assault, but returning without
any effect left off making any farther Attempt. Mean while <i>Pelsaert</i> arriving
with the <i>Sardam</i> Frigat from <i>Holland</i>, sent a Boat ashore, which by a little Skiff
dispatcht by <i>Hays</i>, was inform’d of all the Passages; whereupon the Boat returning,
<i>Pelsaert</i> as he was putting himself into a posture of Defence, espy’d a Sloop coming
about the Southern Point of the Island, in which were eleven of the Rebels
clad in Scarlet with Silver Lace, which making directly towards the Ship, as soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>as they came up, were commanded to throw away their Arms over-board; which
having done, and coming aboard the Frigat, they were all put in Irons, as also
their remaining Party, and condemn’d to die.</p>

<p class='c010'>Opposite to the <i>Abrolhos</i> on the Main Coast, a plain Countrey extends it self
thirty Leagues in length, inhabited by the <i>Ouetacates</i>, a cruel People, who continually
either destroy one another, or else make sad slaughters amongst their Neighbors.</p>

<p class='c010'>The County <i>Porto Seguro</i> belongs to the <i>Spanish</i> Duke of <i>Avero</i>, but is very much
decay’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Beast <i>Capybara</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Rivers <i>Moucuripe</i>, <i>Caruvelas</i>, and <i>Lucuru</i>, breed abundance of Water-Hogs
call’d <i>Capybara</i>, which have short Feet, Bristles and Ears, a thick Body and Head,
with a bearded Snout, besides two Tusks, and twenty four lesser Teeth in each
Jaw, but no Tail; they feed on Grass and Bushes in whole Herds on the Shore,
and make a terrible noise; and though they cannot run fast, yet they dive and
swim extraordinary quick.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Tapiirete</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Tapiirete</i> also resembles a Hog, especially in its Head and Feet, but is as big as
a Heifer of six Moneths old, hath a Snout hanging over its under Lip, a Mouth full
of Teeth, and on its Skin short and dark colour’d Hair. This Beast is very libidinous,
and in the Nights spoils the Fruit-Trees, especially the Sugar-Canes, but in
the Day-time it sleeps in Thickets. The Flesh of a young <i>Tapiirete</i> tastes like
Beef.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, the Inhabitants of <i>Porto Seguro</i> are plentifully supply’d with Rabbets,
and the more, because there being divers sorts of them, (some say five) they are taken
in great abundance, either in Traps, Snairs, or Gins, or by discovering their
Holes; for the Hunters stopping the entrance of them, dig a Hole directly over the
place where the Coneys lodge, and so kill them with long Pike-staves in the
Ground.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Five sorts of Rabbets in <i>Brasile</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Of these five sorts of Rabbets in <i>Brasile</i>, the chiefest, call’d <i>Paca</i>, hath a thick
Head, little Ears, their fore-Feet bigger than their hind-Feet, short, hard, and brown
Hair, speckled grey on the Sides, but no Tail: The Flesh of this sort of Rabbets
is very delicate.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second sort is the <i>Tupesi</i>, which being like a Hare amongst us, may as well
be accounted of that kind.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Aguti</i> resembles our Rabbets, onely it hath harsh brown Hair, round Ears,
bald Feet, gruntles like a Hog, hath two Toes more on their hind-Legs than on
the foremost.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Cavia Cobaya</i>, though less than the <i>European</i> Rabbets, excell them in soft
and divers-colour’d Hair, distinguish’d by white, red, and black Spots; their Head
and Teeth resemble those of a Rat, but it hath no Tail: No Rabbets can be made
tamer than these, and if carry’d to any remote Countrey, breed as well there as in
<i>Brasile</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The last of all is the <i>Aparea</i>, which differs little in running from a Hare, as also
in respect of the Head and Beard, harbors more in rent Cliffs than in sandy
Ground.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Tree <i>Tucum</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Soil of <i>Porto Seguro</i> bears two sorts of Palm-Trees, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Tucum</i> and <i>Airi</i>;
the <i>Tucum</i> hath small Boughs full of prickly Leaves, and a fruit not unlike the Damask
Prune, hanging in Clusters of three or four hundred together; and being excellent
Food to fatten Hogs and Apes; also when press’d yielding a clear Oyl, which
is highly esteem’d: the Fruit when ripe grows black without, and within hath a
white Kernel: of the Leaves the <i>Brasilians</i> spin fine and strong Thred.</p>

<img src='images/i_577.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Airi</i> grows much higher than the <i>Tucum</i>, and hath also longer Leaves, a
Body full of sharp Thorns, and a round Fruit full of white and oylie Pulp, but not
eatable; the Wood hard, heavy and black, sinks in the Water, and the <i>Brasilians</i>
make their Clubs of the same.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Bird <i>Cocoi</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Along the Rivers flie the Birds <i>Cocoi</i>, resembling Herons, though in beauty they
far exceed them; they have but little Flesh, long sharp Bills, of a yellowish green
colour, and curious Crests of Feathers on their Heads, which fall back over their
Necks; their Flesh when young is delicate.</p>

middle from twelve to eighteen Fathom deep, lies in thirteen Degrees Southward
of the <i>Equinoctial Line</i>. The Coast rises white along the Sea side. The Current according
to the course of the Sun runs six Moneths towards the South, and as many
towards the North. The opening of the Inlet is on the South, but it flows up Northerly,
and contains two Leagues and a half in breadth; several fresh Rivers discharge
their Waters into the same: The utmost and biggest Island <i>Taperica</i> breaks
off the Waves which come rowling in from the Ocean. Those that Sail into the
same must have the Island on their left Hand, and the Main Coast on their right,
which is known by a Promontory, on which the Fort <i>Antonio</i>, and the old City
<i>Villa Veja</i> are built, near a little Bay with a Foreland on the North, from which the
Main Coast circling like a Half-Moon ends near the Point <i>Tapagipe</i>, which juts
out from <i>Bahia Todos los Sanctos</i>. The Castle <i>Tapesiepe</i> stands on the utmost Point,
where the Countrey winding towards the East makes the Inlet larger, from
whence a narrow Channel runs up into the Countrey, and there makes a Lake
which extends North and South: from the Mouth of the Lake the Coast reaches
Northward to the River <i>Pitanga</i>, which comes gliding out of the East, and in its
Passage receives several Streams, on whose Banks stand divers Sugar-Mills. From
<i>Pitanga</i> the Coast extends a League Northward, then Westerly with a crooked
Elbow, in whose circumference lie two nameless Isles close under the Shore; this
Elbow ends in a blunt Point, about half a League from which lies the Island <i>Mare</i>,
a League long, in the Mouth of the River <i>Pitanga</i>. To the Northward from hence
a River disembogues in the said Inlet. More Southerly appears <i>Monks-Isle</i>, from
whence the Coast extends it self Northerly, where several Islands appear at an
exact distance from the Coast; the first beyond the fore-mention’d blunt Point,
is <i>Birapebiara</i>; the next, which lies closer to the Shore, <i>Porto Madero</i>; next comes in
view a long Island in the Mouth of a River, from whence the Countrey extends
Westward, and fronts the Island <i>De Fuentes</i>, as doth also the River <i>Tambaria</i>, which
comes out of the North, but empties it self with a crooked Arm near the rest; from
hence the Coast with two little Bays runs North-West to the Stream <i>Geresipe</i>, in
whose Mouth, which is pretty large, appear three Isles on a row, the utmost whereof
is call’d <i>Caraibe</i>, the middlemost <i>Pycca</i>, the innermost hath no Name, but divides
the River into two Channels; from hence the Coast bends with several Inlets, into
which fall divers Rivulets towards the South, from the River <i>Cachoera</i>, full of little
Isles, opposite to which stand several Sugar-Mills. Against <i>Cachoera</i> appears the
Island <i>Meve</i>, and more Southerly <i>Taperica</i>, between the sharp Point <i>Tapagipe</i> and
the Castle <i>Antonio</i>. Near the fore-mention’d the City <i>St. Salvador</i> was built by <i>Thomas
de Sosa</i>, who weighing Anchor from <i>Lisbon</i>, <i>Anno 1549.</i> Landed safely near
<i>Villa Veja</i>, and about half a League from thence pitch’d upon a Hill, and took order
forthwith for the erecting of his new City there, giving to each of his Followers a
place to build on: the <i>Jesuits</i> chose the large Plain where at present stands the
Church Consecrated to the Virgin <i>Mary</i>; the Names of the said <i>Jesuits</i> were <i>Juan
Azpilcueta</i>, <i>Antonio Pireo</i>, <i>Leonardo Nonnio</i>, <i>Didaco Jacobeo</i>, <i>Vincentio Roderigo</i>, and <i>Emanuel
Nobrega</i>; whilest the common People set themselves to the building of Dwelling-houses:
But when <i>John</i> the Third, King of <i>Portugal</i>, sent a Priest thither to Teach
in the new Church of <i>Maria</i>, the fore-mention’d <i>Jesuits</i> remov’d from thence to a
high Hill, which they call’d <i>The Mountain Calvarien</i>, whither divers <i>Brasilians</i> came
flocking, and pitch’d their Tents about the Cloyster, admiring their strange Neighbors.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>When <i>Sosa</i> Landed on the fore-mention’d Shore, the <i>Portuguese</i> had but little
footing on <i>America</i>; for their Plantations at <i>Isleos</i>, <i>St. Vincent</i>, <i>Pernambuco</i>, <i>Villa Veja</i>,
<i>Itamaraca</i>, and <i>Porto Seguro</i>, discover’d by <i>Pedro Alvares Capralis</i>, <i>Anno 1500.</i> were run
all to ruine.</p>

<p class='c010'>Beside the City <i>St. Salvador</i> and the decay’d Town <i>Villa Veja</i>, the City <i>Paripe</i>
lies three Leagues farther into the Countrey, consisting of three thousand Families,
and eighteen Sugar-Mills: The Countrey about the same produces plenty of
Cotton.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Island <i>Taperica</i>, which is pretty large, hath a fertile Soil for the production
of Tobacco, and Grass to fatten Cattel: The Inhabitants boyl much Train-Oyl
of the Whales, which come ashore there in considerable numbers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Twelve Leagues Southward from <i>St. Salvador</i> appears the Village <i>Cacocheira</i>, formerly
belonging to a rich <i>Portuguese</i>, who took great pains in reforming the salvage
People <i>Guaymures</i> to a civil Life; but seeing he profited but little, he caus’d
great Companies of them to be remov’d to <i>Taperica</i>, that they might do less mischief,
where the unusual and unwholsom Air kill’d them all in a short time.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lordship <i>Bahia</i> hath abundance of Sugar-Mills, which are either turn’d by
the Water, or drawn by Oxen.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The manner of Planting Sugar-Canes.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Worm <i>Guirapeacopa</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The manner of making Sugar in the Sugar-Mills.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Sugar-Canes, by the <i>Brasilians</i> call’d <i>Viba</i> or <i>Tacomaree</i>, grow better in a clayie
and fat Soil, over which the Rivers flowing leave their Mud, than on High-lands,
Hills, or Mountains; they are Planted after this manner: They first plough their
Fields, weed them, and make Holes at an exact distance one from the other, into
which they plant their Canes in such a manner, that the tops touch one another.
The Holes before mention’d require more Earth to fill them in Summer than in
Winter, that the violent Heat of the Sun may not dry up the Root, and that the
Rain may the freelier come at them to moisten them, for the more moisture they
have, the better they grow; they attain to their full ripeness in ten, or at most in
twelve Moneths; <i>February</i> and <i>March</i> being the two last Winter Moneths, are accounted
the best to Plant in, because the Earth softned by Rains, suffers the Root
to shoot forth the better. The ripe Canes being cut off, are left in the Field till the
following Year; during which time new Canes growing, are often ground in the
Mill with the old ones; but if they stand two years, then the sweet Liquor dries
up, and the Cane withers. The young Plants carefully planted in good Ground
may last forty, nay fifty years; but in a barren Soil they set new every five years.
Sometimes in great Droughts and extraordinary hot Seasons, the Canes are scorcht
to nothing, which being burnt in the Winter, the Ashes serve to Dung the Ground;
and so in like manner when the Water, overflowing the Fields, drowns the young
Plants. In moist Grounds the black-wing’d Worm, call’d <i>Guirapeacopa</i>, (by the <i>Portuguese</i>
nam’d <i>Pao de Galeuba</i>) gnaws the Roots in such a manner, that the Canes
die; and sometimes it happens also that the Weeds choak the young Plants;
wherefore the Ground is to be weeded four times a year, till such time as the Canes
are strong enough to bear against the Weeds: they cut off the ripe Canes at the
lowermost Joynt, and, all the Leaves being first pull’d off, tie them up in Bundles,
and bring them to the Mills, which consist of three great Iron Bars, between
which the Canes are squeez’d. The Water-Mills are turn’d by the force of the Water,
which in great Gutters led from high Mountains falls with exceeding force into
Pools made for that purpose; after which manner, though they wind the Canes
much faster, yet they get not so much Sugar as when they grind them in the Mills
turn’d by Cattel: The places through which the Juice runs must be cleans’d twice
in twenty four hours; the Canes put in behind between the first Bar, are turn’d
into the second, and thence into the third, which successively squeezes out all the
remaining Juice: The Canes thus press’d, serve for Fewel to burn; but they constantly
keep such a great Fire both Night and Day, that besides those press’d Canes,
they burn forty Fathom of Wood in twenty four hours, insomuch that whole
Woods are consum’d in a short time: The Liquor, nam’d <i>Caldo</i>, runs along woodden
Gutters into great Kettles, in which it is boyl’d, but if it happen to be over-boyl’d
they put Water amongst it, whereby it becomes excellent Food for Horses;
then they put the Liquor into a second Kettle, where it is boyl’d afresh, and also
scumm’d; and for the better cleansing of it, Lime-Juyce and other things are put
amongst it; then they strein it through Clothes, and give the Dross which remains
in the same to the Slaves, which work for half a year together Night and Day like
Horses. The Dross mix’d with Water makes also good Wine. Out of the great
Kettles, by the <i>Portuguese</i> call’d <i>Caldero de Mellar</i>, the <i>Caldo</i> runs into the lesser nam’d
<i>Tachas</i>, where it is boyl’d a third time, and continually stirr’d till it comes to be
thick like a Syrrup, and at last to the consistence of Sugar: It may be accounted
amongst the Mysteries of Nature, that while the Sugar boyls in the <i>Tachas</i>, which
are the little Kettles, they must drop Oyl amongst the Liquor, which if they should
do whilest it is in the great Kettel, the Liquor would not turn to the consistence of
Sugar; as on the contrary, if they should put their Lye into the little Kettles as they
do into the great, the Liquor would be quite spoil’d. In their Boyling-houses
stand several hundreds of Earthen Pots one by another on Planks full of Holes;
which Pots they cover with moist clay, and after fourteen days knocking it out of
the Pots, they separate the brown Sugar from the white, both which are laid to
dry in the Sun, and put into Chests.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of <i>Pernambuco</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Northward from <i>Bahia de Todos los Sanctos</i> lies <i>Pernambuco</i>, which extends along
the Coast above seventy Leagues, between the River <i>St. Francisco</i> and the
Countrey of <i>Hamaraca</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Pernambuco</i>, which signifies <i>Hells-Mouth</i>, is on the East wash’d by the Northern
Ocean; in which grows a Weed much like an Oaken Leaf, and so thick, that unless
it be cut to make their Way, impedes the Sailing of Ships.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Several sorts of Fish.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Sea is also very full of Fish, which in calm Weather are visible sixty Fathom
deep, and are taken in greater abundance than they are able to spend; for they no
sooner let down a Bait, cover’d with Feathers and Tallow, but the Fish immediately
swallowing the same, are taken.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here are in the first place abundance of <i>Hays</i>, a Fish so rank and oylie, that they
are not eatable, but their Brains are accounted good against the Stone.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are also hereabouts a sort of flying Fish like Herrings, but not so big;
they have Wings like Bats, which carry them above Water whilest they are wet;
they swim in shoals, and are chased by all other Fishes, which endeavoring to
escape by flight out of the Water, they become a prey to the Sea-pies.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Sea-Breams are as well tasted as the flying Fish; the Mariners cover them
in Salt, or stuff them within full of Salt and Pepper, and so hang them to dry in
the Sun.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Pernambuco</i> it self lying in five Degrees Southward from the <i>Equinox</i>, produces
abundance of <i>Brasile</i> Wood and Sugar-Canes, which last is no proper <i>Brasilian</i>
Plant, for the first Plants thereof were by the <i>Portuguese</i> first transplanted thither
from the <i>Canary</i> Islands.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First Discovery.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey was first discover’d by <i>Americus Vesputius</i>, who being sent thither
by <i>Emanuel</i>, King of <i>Portugal</i>, to discover the Coast between the Promontory before
<i>Olinda</i> and the Island <i>Itamaraca</i>, and finding a split Rock and some <i>Brasilian</i> Huts,
Landed, and ask’d the Denomination of the Coast, which he was inform’d was
call’d <i>Pernambuco</i>, which he found full of steep Mountains, inaccessible Woods, and
in some places Plains and pleasant Valleys; but the chiefest thing he could find to
lade his Ship with, was <i>Brasile</i> Wood; but being inform’d that the Soil would
bear Sugar-Canes, he caus’d <i>Canary</i> Sugar-Plants to be Set there.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chief Towns and Places of note.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Olinda</i>, formerly the chief City of <i>Pernambuco</i>, had (according to <i>Lopez</i>) above
three thousand Houses and seventy Sugar-Mills: It is built on several Hills, which
on the North-side are steep and overgrown with Brambles; betwixt which in many
places grow Orange-Trees. <i>John Newhof</i>, who arriv’d at <i>Olinda</i> Anno 1642.
found a few <i>Netherlanders</i> and <i>Spaniards</i> there, who dwelt in the ruin’d Houses.
The Land-side of the City is strengthned by Hills overgrown with Brambles and
Thorns, and towards the Sea-side with Earthen Walls, fortifi’d by fourteen Bulwarks
and a Stone Castle, able to withstand a considerable force: The Out-works
towards the South were maintain’d by <i>Jews</i>, who from the fore-mention’d Hills
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>could see not onely a great way into the Ocean, but also the River <i>Biberibi</i>, which
hath a Stone Bridge leading to the City, and Northerly and Westward the Way lies
through great Woods and Forrests. <i>Olinda</i> it self is divided into twenty seven large
Streets, besides lesser Lanes and several Avenues, and five chief Churches, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Misericordia</i>, <i>Nostra Sennora del Emparo</i>, and <i>Nostra Sennora de Guadalupe</i>, <i>San Salvador</i>,
and <i>San Pedro</i>, besides two others of lesser note. On the highest Hill stands the <i>Jesuits</i>
Cloyster, built square and high, and surrounded with Walls, on which <i>Sebastian</i>
King of <i>Portugal</i>, by the perswasion of his Uncle Cardinal <i>Henry</i>, spent a great
sum of Money, and endow’d it with annual Revenues, <i>Anno 1571.</i> The <i>Capuchins</i>
also built a stately Cloyster towards the East. The <i>Franciscans</i> moreover inhabited
a magnificent Building, near which stood the Governors Palace. The <i>Carmelites</i>
had also a stately Edifice, whose former lustre still appears by the Ruines, where
now Cattel graze; from the Hills about which may be exactly discern’d <i>Reciffa</i>, the
Promontory of <i>St. Augustine</i>, and the Castle before the Road of <i>Reciffa</i>: Along the
Shore stood the <i>Dominican</i> Cloyster, and in the upper part of the City the Minster,
Consecrated to <i>St. Bento</i>, exceeding strong both by Nature and Art; near which
stood <i>Conceptio de nostra Sennora</i>. The Fort <i>Juan de Albuquerque</i> stood on the South-side,
from whence a Way leads you along the Shore to <i>Reciffa</i>, where hard by the
Potter’s House stood a Beacon. But since <i>Olinda</i> fell into the hands of the <i>Netherland
East-India</i> Company, they built a strong Fortress on the North near the Sea-side,
where formerly a great Trade was driven with Sugar, insomuch that forty
Ships have been fraighted in a day therewith from <i>Olinda</i>, and still as much more
remain’d in the Store-houses. The Sugar cannot be made without the help of
<i>African</i> Slaves, and that in great numbers; for <i>Angola</i> alone provided fifteen thousand
four hundred and thirty <i>Moors</i> for the Sugar-Mills about <i>Olinda</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Expedition of <i>Loncque</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Olinda</i> taken by the <i>Hollanders</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fort <i>St. George</i> taken.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the Years 1601, 1602, and 1623. there was sent to surprize this City <i>Henrick
Loncque</i>, who a little before with <i>Peter Peterszoon Hein</i> took the <i>Spanish</i> Plate-Fleet,
and brought it away from <i>Matanca</i>. In the middle of <i>June</i>, Anno 1629. <i>Loncque</i>
weighed Anchor from the <i>Goerean</i> Road, and between great <i>Canary</i> and <i>Teneriff</i> he
was Engag’d (having but eight Sail) with forty <i>Spanish</i> Ships, Commanded by <i>Frederick
de Toledo</i>, fought his way through the midst of them, and near <i>St. Vincent</i> (the
rest of his Fleet being come up to him, which in all made up twenty seven) he
stay’d for a farther promis’d Supply of Ships to assist him, and the longer, because
the Men rais’d by the <i>Netherland West-India</i> Company were taken into the <i>States</i> Service,
to oppose the <i>Spanish</i> and Imperial Forces, who at that time had gain’d some
advantage upon them: But not long after <i>Hartogen-bosch</i> being taken by the <i>Hollanders</i>,
the rest of the expected Fleet, with the promis’d Aid, arriv’d at <i>St. Vincent</i>;
from whence <i>Loncque</i>, after four Moneths stay, set Sail with these additional Forces,
his Fleet then consisting of fifty Sail of Ships, which carry’d above seven thousand
Soldiers, besides Seamen; but he was forc’d to lie a considerable time under the
<i>Line</i>, being either becalm’d or beaten back by contrary Winds, insomuch that many
of his Men perish’d, or were disabled with the Scurvey: At last his Fleet being
come to an Anchor upon the Coast of <i>Pernambuco</i>, the first that Landed about two
Leagues Northward of <i>Olinda</i>, was Colonel <i>Diederik van Waerdenberg</i>, who by Day-break
divided his Men into three Divisions, the Forlorn-Hope consisting of nine
hundred and thirty four Men, march’d towards <i>Olinda</i> along the Shore, led by <i>Adolf
van der Eltz</i>; the second being a thousand and forty nine, by <i>Stein Callenfels</i>; the
third, consisting of nine hundred and sixty five, was led by <i>Fouke Honx</i>: thus
drawn out, and marching on, they met with no resistance till they came to the River
<i>Dolce</i>, where eight hundred <i>Portuguese</i> Charg’d on them from behind a new Sconce;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>but <i>Waerdenberg</i> wading up to the Middle through the River with two Field-Pieces,
the Enemy left his Works and ran into the Wood; the Forlorn-Hope approaching
the City, march’d up towards the right side, up a Way through the Woods,
Scal’d the Walls, near which the <i>Jesuits</i> Cloyster stood, over which he got after some
resistance. The second Party march’d in a narrow Path along the Shore, and
broke into the City between the <i>Franciscans</i> and <i>Jesuits</i> Cloyster, towards the Cathedral
<i>Salvador</i>, from whence they discharg’d several Guns, as also from the Castle,
which they had taken, whilest <i>Fouke Honx</i> Storm’d the Battlements towards the
South; but <i>Stein Callenfels</i> and <i>Eltz</i> being already Masters of <i>Olinda</i>, the Defendants
surrendred all. Mean while the Colonel’s Skiff brought five hundred Men more
ashore, with which he march’d without any hinderance into the City, where the
Conquerors, faint with excessive Heat and want of Water, found but little Booty,
because the Inhabitants having notice of the <i>Hollanders</i> coming, had convey’d all
their Goods and Wealth to <i>Reciffa</i>, which the Governor <i>Matthias Albuquerque</i> (Brother
to the Lord <i>Duarte Albuquerque</i>, to whom <i>Pernambuco</i> properly belong’d) burnt
with all the Store-houses, partly out of revenge to the Inhabitants, who fled contrary
to his Commands, and partly because he would not enrich the <i>Hollanders</i>. The <i>Portuguese</i>
Captain, <i>Correa de Castel Blanco</i>, in his Letter to the King of <i>Spain</i>, values
the loss at twenty hundred thousand <i>Ducats</i>. But still the <i>Portuguese</i> had possession
of several Forts about the Countrey, whereof the most considerable was <i>St. George</i>,
whither <i>Stein Callenfels</i> march’d in the Night with six hundred Men, but his Ladders
being too short, and the Hand-Granado’s not easily taking fire, he was forc’d to
Retreat; whereupon judging it most convenient to besiege the Castle, he digg’d
Trenches about the same; nor was it long ere the Besieged desir’d Quarter, which
being granted, they march’d from thence with ninety Men. The Water Castle surrendring
in like manner, they found fifteen Brass Guns therein; and in that of
<i>St. George</i> four thousand pound of Gun-powder, and twenty four Iron Guns.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the <i>Netherland</i> Forces Landed on <i>Pernambuco</i>, the <i>Portuguese</i> inhabited
eleven Towns, the chiefest whereof being <i>Olinda</i>, was generally Garrison’d by four
Companies of Armed Citizens, each containing a hundred Men and three Companies
of Soldiers: Amongst the Citizens were two hundred Merchants, some
of whom were judg’d to be worth fifty thousand <i>Crusados</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Southward from <i>Olinda</i>, between the River <i>Biberibe</i> and the Ocean, was a narrow
Cawsey, at the end of which lay the populous Village <i>Reciffa</i>, where the Ships
lade and unlade. About the middle of the Cliff, being a League long, is the Anchoring
place for great Ships, call’d <i>Pozo</i>. At the end of the fore-mention’d Cawsey
against <i>Pozo</i>, appear’d a round Tower of Fre-stone.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The memorable Exploits of the <i>English</i> under Captain <i>James Lancaster</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Journal kept by the <i>English</i> Fleet that came hither under the Command of
Captain <i>James Lancaster</i>, Anno 1595. makes mention of a Fort which lay at the
Mouth of the Haven before <i>Reciffa</i>, which the <i>English</i> valiantly Storm’d, notwithstanding
six hundred Men and seven Brass Guns might easily have made it invincible:
But they conquering the same, march’d up to <i>Olinda</i>, took the Suburb, consisting
of a hundred Houses, without any resistance, as also a great Booty, and the
greater, because the Goods of a rich <i>Carak</i> which had some few days before suffer’d
Shipwrack, were kept there; they also took fifteen laden Ships, and for thirty days
kept the whole Countrey about <i>Olinda</i> restless with continual Alarms. Since this
Invasion the <i>Portuguese</i> built a third Fort on <i>Reciffa</i>, so that the Ships must pass
in between two Forts, where the Channel is also full of Rocks, and consequently
the more dangerous.</p>

<p class='c010'>From <i>Reciffa</i> the Goods are sent in Barques or Lighters to <i>Olinda</i>, between which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>and <i>St. Salvador</i> run the two great Rivers <i>Francisco</i> and <i>Real</i>, the first whereof retains
its freshness twenty Leagues into the Ocean.</p>

<p class='c010'>Along the River <i>Popitinga</i> stand many Sugar-Mills; and five Leagues farther
Northward beyond <i>Olinda</i> the <i>Portuguese</i> inhabit these Villages, <i>viz.</i> <i>Garasu</i>, <i>Reciffa</i>,
<i>Moribeca</i>, <i>Antonio de Cabo</i>, <i>Miguel de Poyuca</i>, <i>Gonsalvo de Una</i>, <i>Povacon de Porto Calvo</i>, <i>Alagoa
del Nort</i>, and <i>Alagoa del Zur</i>, besides other <i>Brasilian</i> Hamlets, and above seventy
Sugar-Mills.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The nature of the Soil in <i>Pernambuco</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The County of <i>Pernambuco</i> hath for the most part a good Soil, several Plains,
low Hills, and fruitful Valleys, abounding with fair Canes, which also grow on
the Mountains <i>Masurepe</i>, <i>Zebaatan</i>, <i>Poyuca</i>, and <i>Moribeque</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Wilds of <i>El Gran Matto</i>, afford the best Wood, with which they drive the
greatest Trade in the Village <i>Laurenzo</i>. Whilest <i>Matthias Albuquerque</i> Intrench’d
himself a League and a half Westward from <i>Olinda</i>, by the Sugar-Mills belonging
to <i>Francisco Montero</i>, with a hundred <i>Portuguese</i>, and three times as many Armed
<i>Brasilians</i>, <i>Loncque</i> finding that he could not long keep the City <i>Olinda</i> against the
Enemy, caus’d the same to be pull’d down and burnt.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sergippo del Rey.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Between the Rivers <i>Francisco</i> and <i>Real</i>, lies the Town <i>Sergippo del Rey</i>, up in the
Countrey near a small Rivulet, which at Spring-Tydes hath fourteen Foot Water.
The Woods round about feed wild Cattel, and the Mountains contain Mines of
Gold and Silver.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first Plantation in <i>Brasile</i> was in the Island <i>Itamaraca</i>, three Leagues long
and two broad, but extends its Jurisdiction along the Main Coast, from which it
is separated by a narrow River, which runs betwixt both thirty five Leagues. The
Countrey is eminent for twenty Sugar-Mills, and abundance of <i>Brasile</i> Wood.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Villa de Conception.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The chief Town of this Island is call’d <i>Villa de Conception</i> near the Sea, which
round about the Island is full of Rocks. The <i>French</i> settling themselves here at first,
were driven from thence by the <i>Portuguese</i>. The Town it self, built on a Rock, hath
a strong Castle on the one side, erected near a shrubby Moor; to the Northward
of which <i>Stein Callenfels</i> found a little Isle, scarce a Musquet-shot long, which at
High-water is overflown, and being full of small Trees makes a Receptacle for
Sea-Fowl, which flock thither about six a Clock in the Evening to Roost on the
Boughs, from which, when once setled to take their repose, they will not stir till
six of the Clock the next Morning, though you discharge Guns at them all Night;
but since <i>Stein Callenfels</i> cut down the Wood to make Pallisado’s for the new Fort
against the Town <i>Conception</i>, they were never seen afterwards.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>This Territory of <i>Parayba</i> borrows its Denomination from the chief Town, lying
five Leagues from the North Sea near the River <i>Parayba</i>, which in the Summer
Season hath but little Water, but in the Winter Season increases to that heighth,
that it oftentimes on a sudden overflowing the Countrey sweeps away both People,
Cattel, and Houses. The City it self, though small, yet hath several fair
Buildings, amongst which three Churches and as many Cloysters, inhabited by
<i>Franciscans</i>, <i>Carmelites</i>, and <i>Benedictins</i>, are none of the meanest. The Countrey thereabouts
indifferently fruitful, hath twenty Sugar-Mills. The Mountain <i>Cupaguao</i>,
formerly very populous with Natives, being exceeding fertile, produces all manner
of Fruit; at present it lies desolate, the <i>Brasilians</i> being all destroy’d by the <i>Portuguese</i>.
These Mountains produce also curious green Stones, which the Inhabitants
wore in their Lips for an Ornament, and which also cures the Griping of the
Guts, by being laid upon the Belly.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Silver-Mine <i>Copaoba</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>French</i> under the Command of Captain <i>Dourmigas</i>, discover’d ninety years
ago the Silver-Mine <i>Copaoba</i>, and for considerable time carry’d Silver and <i>Brasile</i>
Wood from hence, till the <i>Portuguese</i> made themselves absolute Masters.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, on the North-side of <i>Parayba</i>, the Salvages call’d <i>Petiguars</i> inhabit
sixteen Villages.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Birds.</div>

<p class='c010'>Amongst the Birds of prey which breed here, are the <i>Ouyaourassou</i>, twice as big as
a Crane, with curious Feathers, and so bold and strong, that it devours not onely
Sheep, but Deer and Men.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Bird <i>Mayton</i> is no way inferior in beauty to the Peacock, his whole Body
being cover’d with white and black Feathers; on his Head grows a Tuft; the Flesh
is also very pleasant to the taste.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Toucan</i>, another Bird, resembles a Turtle-Dove in all parts, except the Bill
and Breast; for the Belly is ten Inches long and three broad, the Breast of an
Orange colour, mix’d with Crimson Spots; the remaining part is white, the Back
red, and the Tail and Wings Coal-black.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Plant <i>Yarammacarou</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Plant call’d <i>Yarammacarou</i> deserves also a peculiar observation, <i>viz.</i> It is
thicker than a Man’s Thigh, grows twelve Foot high, with three Branches of equal
length and thickness, which you may easily break; it is green without, white within,
and without Leaves, leaving red Blossoms streak’d with blue, from whence grows
a Fruit about the bigness of an Apple, crimson without and white within, and
tasting like a Mulberry.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Guara-tereba</i>, with other strange Fish.</div>

<p class='c010'>The River <i>Parayba</i> produces amongst many other Fishes the <i>Guara-tereba</i>, which
hath a thick Body, flat Head, crooked Back, split Tail, and triangular Scales,
which laid in the Sun, shine like polish’d Gold.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Sea also hereabouts affords a strange Fish with a very long and thin Tail,
the Females whereof Lay every day Eggs like Hens: they are full of poysonous
Prickles, and divided into several sorts, amongst which the chiefest are accounted
the <i>Naainari</i> and <i>Jabebara</i>.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Description of the Sea Coast of <i>Brasile</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Tree.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The Sea-Coast of <i>Brasile</i> from <i>St. Vincent</i> to <i>Spirito Santo</i> appears as followeth:
Before the Coast of <i>St. Vincent</i> lie the four little Isles <i>Queimadas</i>, and on one
side the <i>Alcatraces</i> and <i>Busios</i>; East North-East from which bears the Island <i>Sebastian</i>:
Before the Inlet <i>Ubatuba</i> lies the Isle <i>Dos Porcos</i>, close under a high Shore, where the
Haven runs far up in the Countrey. Fourteen Leagues farther the Island <i>Grande</i>,
stor’d with fresh Water, with Fish-ponds, Woods, and two good Havens. Before the
Road of <i>Garatuba</i> appear several broken Isles, the chiefest whereof is <i>Morambaya</i>. The
Ships Sailing along the <i>Brasilian</i> Coast view next the Mouth of the wide River
<i>Jenero</i>, without fear of Rocks or Shoals. Moreover, a sandy Ground extends from
the Western Point to <i>Cape Frio</i>, which rises out of the Sea like a Rock, with white
Streaks, and crack’d on the top, between both which the high Island before <i>Frio</i>
makes a safe Harbor. Nine Leagues beyond <i>Frio</i> to the Northward, <i>St. Salvador</i>
opens a large Bay, hemm’d in on the South by divers nameless Isles. Lastly, the
several Salt-pans along this Coast are very remarkable, as also the Promontory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span><i>St.Thoma</i> and <i>Parayba</i>, the Inlets <i>Manangea</i> and <i>Itapemeri</i>, and the River <i>Guarapari</i>,
famous for the Mountain <i>Pero Cam</i> towards the North, and <i>Guapel</i> to the South.
The Island <i>Salvago</i>, round and mountainous, lies before the Mouth of the River
<i>Guarapari</i>, where the Main Coast grows uneven and Hilly. On the North-East
Point of <i>Spirito Santo</i> a long ridge of Rocks appears above the Sea; and near the Inlet
rises three black Hills on the South, and two Leagues up in the Countrey the broken
Mountain <i>Mestre Alvaro</i>, which extends along the Sea-Coast. The River <i>Des
Reyos Magos</i> encompasses three Mountains severally, and makes three Isles. The
Coast on each side of the River <i>Dolce</i> is very plain and even, but <i>Cricare</i> hath a mixture
of high and low Lands. In the Mouth of the River <i>Maranipe</i> lies a great company
of white Shelves near together, appearing afar off as if all one. <i>Parairepe</i> is remarkable
by the high Trees growing on it. The Mouth of the River <i>Caruvelas</i> lies
full of Sand-plats. Near the Beacon <i>Tauhaen</i> rises a red Cliff from which a sandy
Point reaches to the River <i>Curubabo</i>. Before <i>Porto Seguro</i> lie several dangerous
Rocks in the Sea, to the Southward of which rises the High-land <i>Cape Pasqual</i>. Not
far from hence <i>Santa Cruiz</i> a good Haven for small Vessels, from whence the Coast
extends North North-East, and South South-West, to <i>Rio Grande</i>, where the Shoals
call’d <i>Baxos de St. Antonio</i>, making a dangerous Entry, force the Ships for the
most part to keep three Leagues from the Shore. Beyond the Arm of <i>Rio Grande</i>
appear three high Mountains cover’d with Trees; from whence to <i>Ilheos</i> is a safe
Passage free from Shelves. Eight Leagues farther, the River <i>Dos Contas</i> runs between
two broken Cliffs into the Sea: in the Mouth of it rises a Rock resembling a high
Island. Between <i>Ilheos</i> and <i>Contas</i> the Coast rises also, but falls low again in a Bay,
where white Sugar-Mills, formerly belonging to <i>Lucas Giraldes</i>, are seen at a great
distance. The Countrey on each side of the River <i>Camanu</i> is plain; the Stream it
self hath a wide Mouth, and respects with its Northern Shore the Isle <i>Cayepa</i>, dangerous
for the many Shelves which are about the same. The River <i>Tinhare</i> is known
by the Mountain <i>Morro de Santo Paulo</i>, which rises like a Galley on the Southern
Shore. Twelve Leagues farther opens the Bay of <i>Todos los Sanctos</i>, on whose Eastern
Point stands the Castle <i>Antonio</i>, and before the Northern Shore the Island <i>Topoam</i>,
to the East and South-East low and strong. The River <i>Das Pedras</i> falls with
a wide Mouth into the Ocean. Next you pass by the Streams <i>Tapicuru</i>, <i>Real Vasabaris</i>
and <i>Francisco</i>, known by a low Promontory. The Rivers <i>Miguel</i>, <i>Antonio</i>, <i>Camaragili</i>,
<i>Porto Calvo</i>, <i>Formoso</i>, and <i>Serinhaem</i>, disembogue also into the Sea. Next
the Stream <i>Das Pedras</i> rises the Promontory <i>St. Augustine</i>, all overgrown with
Bushes and Brambles. Five Leagues Southward lies the small Isle <i>Alexo</i>. The Coast
from <i>St. Augustine</i> to <i>Pernambuco</i> extends North and by East, and South and by West.
The Island <i>Tamaraca</i> lies in the Mouth of the Stream <i>Gajana</i>; and fifteen Leagues
farther appears <i>Parayba</i>; between which two the Shelf <i>Pedra Furada</i> extends three
Leagues along the Coast, and another from the Shore of the Promontory <i>Blanco</i>,
where the Road <i>Porto de Franeses</i> affords Seamen secure Anchorage for Shipping.
Next to <i>Parayba</i> follow the Havens <i>Treicaon</i>, <i>Pipa</i>, and <i>Basios</i>, the Stream <i>Siara</i> and
<i>Maragnan</i>, which washes the Western part of <i>Brasile</i>, and is taken for the Boundary
between the <i>Spanish Indies</i> and the <i>Portuguese</i>, according to the Division by Pope
<i>Alexander</i> the Sixth, <i>Anno 1502.</i> Lastly, there belongs to <i>Brasile</i> the Island <i>Fernando
de Noronho</i>, in three Degrees of Southern Latitude. The Capuchin, <i>Claude de Abbeville</i>,
going thither, found the same to be six Leagues in circumference, and extraordinary
fruitful; besides good fresh Water, Pease, Beans, <i>Maiz</i>, Potato’s, Melons,
Cotton, Cattel, wild Goats, and all sorts of Poultrey, which this Island affords;
but it chiefly abounds with great variety of a sort of Birds which suffer themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>to be caught with the Hand. There grows likewise a nameless Tree, not unlike
the Laurel, being of a strange Nature, for who e’re touches the Leaves, and afterwards
rubs his Eyes, loses his Sight for four hours, with exceeding pain; which
pain nevertheless another Tree growing in the same Island cures immediately. The
<i>French</i>, who Landed on <i>Noronho</i> Anno 1613. found a <i>Portuguese</i> there, with eighteen
<i>Brasilians</i>, Men, Women, and Children, banish’d thither from <i>Pernambuco</i>, whom
Baptizing, they carry’d to <i>Maragnan</i>. Near <i>Noronho</i> lies the Isle <i>De Feu</i>.</p>

<h4 id='c511' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. X.</span><br /> Maragnan.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Maragnan</i>, forty five Leagues in circumference, lies in two Degrees of Southern
Latitude, and a considerable distance from the Bay, which appears
between the Rivers <i>Aperegha</i> and <i>Comajamu</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Eastern Entrance into this Bay hath before the Promontory <i>Arbres Secs</i>,
the Isle <i>St. Anna</i>, by the <i>Brasilians</i> call’d <i>Upaonmiri</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Opposite to <i>Maragnan</i>, about half way from the said Inlet, fall three Rivers into
the Sea, the most Easterly call’d <i>Mounin</i>, hath a Mouth a Mile wide, and discharges
its Water into the Sea; the middlemost <i>Taboucourou</i>, is five hundred Leagues
long, and ends with two Mouths, half a League distant one from the other;
the most Westerly, call’d <i>Miary</i>, is about six Leagues broad, so falling into the
Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Stream <i>Maracou</i> falls into the <i>Pinare</i>, and thus united they joyn both with
the <i>Miary</i>, which runs exceeding swift into the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>Between the Capes <i>Arbres Secs</i> and <i>De la Tortue</i>, the Coast lies full of sandy
Banks, some of which extend a League into the Ocean.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the other side of the Promontory <i>Tapoytapere</i> near <i>Maragnan</i>, towards the River
of <i>Amazones</i>, lie so many Isles along the Sea-shore, that no Ship is able to approach
the same, because the Spaces between the Isles are overgrown with Trees call’d
<i>Apparituriers</i>, whose Boughs shooting down and rooting in the Sea, produce other
Trees, which grow so close together, that they seem one entire Tree with many
Branches. Besides this Inconvenience there is abundance of drift Sand when the
Wind sits from the Shore, which oftentimes swallows the Ships which lie upon
the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>Beyond <i>Maragnan</i> lie two Roads, the first between the Promontory <i>Arbres</i> and
the Isle <i>St. Anna</i>, but dangerous; the other, discover’d some years since, reaches
to the Fort of <i>Maragnan</i>, and is as dangerous as the first.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Island hath twenty seven Villages, by the Natives call’d <i>Oc</i> or <i>Tave</i>, each
Village consisting of four Houses made of great Stakes, and cover’d with Palm-tree
Leaves against the Rain, each House being thirty Foot broad, and from two hundred
to five hundred Paces long, according to the greater or lesser number of Inhabitants.
The first Village, opposite to <i>St. Anna</i>, is call’d <i>Timbohu</i>; the second,
well known for two eminent Fishing-places, is <i>Itapara</i>; but the two biggest are
<i>Juniparan</i> and <i>Eussaouap</i>, each having about five or six hundred Inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Island of <i>Maragnan</i> lies under a temperate Climate, being seldom troubled
with excessive Colds, Droughts, pestilential Vapors, Wind, Hail, or Thunder, only
it Lightens Morning and Evening in serene Weather. When the Sun returns from
the <i>Tropick</i> of <i>Capricorn</i> to the North, then it Rains for six Weeks together; but
when he declines from <i>Cancer</i> towards the Southern <i>Solstice</i>, the <i>Trade</i>-Wind, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>Eastern Breezes rise at seven of the Clock in the Morning, but grow fainter towards
Sun-setting.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fruitful Soil and rich Coast of <i>Maragnan</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Soil of <i>Maragnan</i> is exceeding fruitful, producing abundance of <i>Brasile</i> Wood,
Sugar, Cotton, the red Colour <i>Roucou</i>, Tobacco, Balsam not inferior to the <i>Arabian</i>,
Pepper, and all manner of Fruits. On the Coast is often found excellent
Amber-greece and Jasper Stones, which the Inhabitants wore in their Lips. In
some places along the Sea-shore appear Rocks of red and white Stone <i>Diaphanous</i>,
like Crystal, which (some say) are as hard as Diamonds, and call’d <i>Allencon</i>. The
Woods produce Timber, and the Shore Stones and Shells, of which they make
Mortar. There are also several pleasant Fields and Hills, whose Feet are wash’d by
delightful Brooks, along which they pass in <i>Canoos</i> from one Village to another.
The Woods consist most of Palm-Trees, amongst which breed all sorts of Fowls
and Beasts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fruit-Trees.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chiefest of the Fruit-Trees which grow here is the <i>Accayou</i>, which being
much bigger than our Pomewaters, hath Leaves not unlike those of an Oak: and
also a Nut resembling a Sheeps Kidney, cover’d with a hard Shell, which incloses
an oylie Pith. Out of these the Islanders press a very wholsom and pleasant Liquor;
as also out of the <i>Pacoeira</i> and <i>Bannanas</i>, both excellent Plants, which will
grow in any Ground. This Plant they pluck up by the Roots wild as soon as it
hath put forth three Leaves; which Leaves being rowl’d up hard together like a
Twig, are again Set, and then sprout up each with ten green Leaves, which when
mov’d by the Wind, rattle like Parchment, and tear very easily: the Stalk is an
Inch thick, from which spread several lesser Branches; under the Leaves hang yellowish
Flowers of a pleasant smell, at whose Stalks are lesser Leaves resembling
little Scoups, full of Juice, in taste like Honey, and in colour like the White of an
Egg: after the Flower follows the Fruit, very like a Cucumber, onely they are
three square, and have a hardish Shell, which incloses a well tasted and wholsom
Pulp, which commonly grows in Clusters. This Plant, when the Fruit is ripe,
is pluck’d up, from whence another springs up immediately, which bears the
like Fruit the next year; so that this Plant lives as it were by propagation continually.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Bannanas</i> bear Leaves of a Fathom long and two Foot broad; the Fruit is
very like that of the <i>Pacoeira</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Mangaa</i> is very like the Apricock both in taste and form.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Tree <i>Jaracaha</i> hath a spread Crown, leaves like those of a Fig-Tree, yellow
Flowers, and Pears with Shells, and full of Kernels.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Ouaieroua</i> is an exceeding sweet-smelling Tree, bears a Fruit much bigger
than the greatest Melons.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Junipap</i>, which is much taller, hath Apples, which whilest they are green
are best, yielding a Juice which Dyes Coal-black, and therefore is us’d by the
Natives to paint their Bodies with: The Apples when ripe are yellow within
and without, very well tasted, and melting in the Mouth.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides these fore-mention’d Fruit-Trees there are several others that grow on
this Island, amongst which is the <i>Vua-pirup</i>, eminent for its Blossom, which is yellow,
blue, and red, and bears delicate Apples, which ripen best in the rainy
Season.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, the <i>Pekey</i>, which three Men cannot Fathom, bears a Fruit of two handfuls
bigness, having a hard thick Shell, and within four Kidney-like Kernels, each
concealing a prickly Stone, which hurts the Mouths of unwary Eaters.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Plant <i>Carouata</i> hath Leaves an Ell long, and two Inches broad; they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>very thick and thistly from the middle, and about two Foot from the Ground
grows an exceeding pleasant Fruit, yellow without and within, three square, a
Finger long, and hanging oftentimes sixty in a Cluster.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Vua</i>, a sort of Melons, green without, and within full of white Pulp and black
Kernels, and hath a pleasant Juice, dissolves to Water, if cut in the middle, sweeter
than Sugar, and very refreshing.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Manioch</i>, a thick Root of the Plant <i>Manicup</i>, Leav’d like a Fig-Tree; being ground
to Meal, it serves in stead of Bread.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides these already mention’d, there are several other Plants, the most usual
are the great flat Beans call’d <i>Commanda-ouassou</i>, and the long Pease <i>Commanda-miry</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Birds.</div>

<p class='c010'>Here are variety of Birds of several sorts, especially of Parrots, which flye in
great Companies, most beautiful to the Eye, and very docible to speak, and also
good for Food.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Partridges <i>Nanbououassou</i>, in bigness no way inferior to a Capon, have blue
Feathers, and also Lay blue Eggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Ourou</i>, resembling a Partridge, hath a Combe like a Cock, but mix’d with
three Colours, <i>viz.</i> red, black, and white.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Bats, nam’d <i>Andheura</i>, have a mournful Note in the Night, often biting those
they find asleep, and suck their Blood so hard that it can hardly be stopt.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Ostriches here call’d <i>Yandou</i>, being as tall as a middle-siz’d Man, cannot
flye, but run as swift as a Greyhound.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Fowl call’d <i>Falian</i>, with long Bills and Cranes Legs, flies very low, but
runs so swift that a Horse can scarce overtake them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange sorts of Fish.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Ocean about <i>Maragnan</i> produces abundance of all sorts of Fish, and amongst
others the <i>Pyraon</i>, six Foot long, thicker than a Barrel, and cover’d with black
Scales of a hand-breadth.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Fish <i>Camouroupouy</i> differs not much from the <i>Pyraon</i>, onely in having fewer
Scales.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Ougry</i>, four Foot long, hath a broad Head, and two sharp Fins on the Back,
which wound terribly. This Fish also swimming in the River, smells of Musk
whilest it stays therein.</p>

<p class='c010'>The like length hath also the <i>Camboury Ouassou</i>, whose Hog-like Head, and yellow
scal’d Tail, makes it seem like a Monster.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Yauebouyre</i> is a Foot in thickness, in length two Fathom, and a Fathom in
breadth, and hath a Tail of half a Fathom long, out of the middle of which flicks
a sharp and great Bone, which makes such dangerous Wounds, that if any part of
a Man’s Body be touch’d therewith, it must be cut off.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Narinnary</i>, which is much lesser, wounds with its Sting very dangerously.</p>

<p class='c010'>The flat Fish <i>Acaraiou</i> hath the length of a Foot, a green Head, thick Scales, a
yellow Back, and white Belly.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Araououa</i> hath a hard Skin, is eight times bigger than the <i>Acaraiou</i> and hath a
three-pointed Sword, with which it kills other Fish.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another sort of Sword-fish is the <i>Panapans</i>, whose Sword is a Foot less than that
of the <i>Araououa</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Picamo</i> and <i>Caramourou</i> resemble the Pilchard, and are taken in great abundance
near the Rocks.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Rivers and Brooks on <i>Maragnan</i> are also very full of Fish, amongst which
the <i>Pourake</i>, four Foot long, full of green, blue, red and white Specks and Streaks,
the Skin so hard that no Sword can penetrate it; wherefore it regards not a blow,
but if it moves, it causes such a pain on the Arm of him that strikes, that he falls
down on the Ground.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>The <i>Caurimata</i>, which is very like a Carp, is the most delicious Fish that ever was
tasted.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Pyrain</i>, without Scales, colour’d red and yellow, hath sharp Teeth, which
cut sloapingly; as also the <i>Opean</i>, <i>Tarehure</i>, <i>Paraty</i>, and <i>Jerou</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The red Crabs <i>Oussa</i>, with hairy Legs, breed about the Roots of the fore-mention’d
Trees that grow in the Water.</p>

<p class='c010'>The white Crabs <i>Aouara-oussa</i> carry the Amber-greece, cast on the Shores to
their Holes.</p>

<p class='c010'>They have also good Mussles, and well rellish’d Oysters sticking on the Boughs
of the said Trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the rainy Season there are generally standing Pools, in which yearly
breed many Fishes, which are taken up by the Inhabitants when the Pools begin
to dry.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Divers kinds of strange Beasts.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, this Island feeds abundance of four-footed Beasts, amongst which
their wild Deer, Rabbets and Hares, differ little from the <i>European</i>. They have also
wild Swine call’d <i>Taiassou</i>, who seem to have Navels on their Backs, which cast
a sweet Musky smell; besides another sort of Swine, not inferior to the former, but
of a stranger shape, being Mouth’d like a Hare, with two long Tusks in their upper
Jaws, and two beneath; their Ears like a Mans; the foremost Feet white, and
hoof’d like an Ass; the hindermost part of their Body like a Bear, and full of Bristles,
half white and half black, three handfuls long: when they creep in their
Holes their staring Bristles fall; they keep much amongst Brambles, feed on Apples
and Roots; In the Winter Season they Stye themselves up in their Holes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here are also Pismire-eaters, call’d <i>Tamandua</i>, with a Boars Head, Dogs Ears,
sharp Snout, Horses Hair, and Ox Feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Tapiyre-ete</i> differ little from wild Cows, onely they have shorter Legs and
Tails, and wanting Horns, are Arm’d in stead thereof with Teeth; in their Heads
are often found a Stone like the <i>Bezoar</i> Stone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Several sorts of <i>Armadillo</i>’s here differ much in form each from the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>The wild Cats <i>Margaia</i> are caught for their curious Skin.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Foxes <i>Janovare</i>, and Leopards <i>Sovassovaran</i>, both curiously mark’d, are very
ravenous.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here is also a deform’d slow creeping Beast call’d <i>Ai</i>, whose Head is like a Mans,
and cover’d with rough and grey Hair, on each Foot three Claws close together,
and at least a Finger long, sharp Teeth, a smooth high black Nose, little drowsie
Eyes, no Ears, a Tail small above and broad at the bottom, long Ash-colour’d
Hair over all the Body; and being about the bigness of a Fox, it climbs slowly up
the Trees, and comes not down before it hath eaten off all the Leaves; it feeds
also on Earth, and sometimes sits on a high Bough without Meat twenty days together;
it goes so softly, that it will hardly clear fifty Paces in twenty four hours.</p>

<p class='c010'>On this Island are likewise all sorts of Apes and Monkies, amongst which is one
most remarkable, call’d <i>The Zimme Cayon</i>, hairy all over, with a long white Beard,
an old Mans Face, bald Ears, black Eyes and long Tail, which they wind about a
Bough, and so hanging, swing themselves from one Tree to another; they are very
fierce as well as subtile, for being wounded with an Arrow, they set upon their
Enemy without the least fear; when they climb up the Trees, they carry their
Mouths and Hands full of Stones to throw at Travellers; and if any one of them
chance to be wounded, all the rest that are near come to help him, and stop the
Wound with Leaves, and the like; the young ones hang upon the Backs of their
Dams, who run very swift with them, and leap from one Tree to another.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Juan Ardenois</i> relates, That the <i>Coyons</i> play at certain Games with the Natives for
Money, and spend what they win in publick Houses.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Joseph de Acosta</i> tells us, That one of these kind of Creatures being sent to a Tavern
for Wine, would not part with his Money before his Pot was fill’d, which he defended
from the Boys that offer’d to take it from him, by throwing Stones at them;
and though it lov’d Wine very well, yet brought it always home without
tasting.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is no less wonderful what <i>Peter Martyr</i> relates of one of these Creatures, <i>viz.</i>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Sagovin</i> resembles a Lyon in the fore-part of the Body, with shaggy Hair;

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Boyete</i>, and other sorts of Serpents.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Serpent <i>Boy-ete</i>, two Fathoms long, without Legs, having a bright speckled
Skin and four sharp Teeth, wounds also mortally with its Tail; but is the less dangerous,
because at the end of the Tail grows a Bladder, which moving rattles as if
there were Pease in it, which gives notice to the Traveller, though unwary, by
which means he makes his escape.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other Serpents call’d <i>Jouboy</i>, <i>Tara-gouyboy</i>, and <i>Tarehuboy</i>, serve the Natives
for a great Delicacy; as also the great Toads or Frogs, call’d <i>Tourourou</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>They have also a sort of Flies call’d <i>Ton</i>, which exceedingly molest them, against
which their chiefest Medicine is Palm-tree Oyl, and the <i>Roucou</i>, with which they

and fifty years ago. The time of their first coming hither us’d formerly to be
solemniz’d with the great Feast call’d <i>Caoven</i>; but because a Woman boldly set upon
a Commander in his Cups, there arose a great Tumult amongst them, and ever
since the Island hath been divided, one Party calling the other <i>Tobaiares</i>, that is,

which the Midwives make at the Birth of the Child, they are generally a
strong People, and many of them living a hundred years, without being grey,
bald, or sick; they live temperate, and under a wholsom Climate: Some of their
Women bear Children (as they say) till they are eighty years of age, which being
born white, turn to be of a Tawny colour, by being anointed with Suet call’d
<i>Roucon</i>, and Oyl; otherwise they are well proportion’d. The Men pluck out all
the Hair of their Foreheads, but suffer it to hang pretty long over their Ears, and
behind. The Women let their Hair hang down to their Middle, and wear woodden
Ear-rings, but the Men hang green Beads in their Lips, and thrust little Bones
through their Noses. They go all stark naked, their Legs are colour’d black with
the Juice of the Herb <i>Junipap</i>, and upon the other parts of their Body appear Figures
of several Representations. Those that will manifest their Valor, and be accounted
hardy, gash their Bodies all over with Wounds, which they heal in such a
manner, that the Scars may more plainly appear. They never come to their usual
Feasts, but dress’d up in various colour’d Feathers; upon the Crown of their Heads
they wear Caps stuck with Plumes, which they call <i>Acangoap</i>, or Coronets, call’d
<i>Acangerar</i>; about their Necks, the Necklaces <i>Aiouacava</i>; over their Shoulders, the Mantles
<i>Assoyave</i>; their Garters they call <i>Tabacoura</i>, at which they hang hollow Nutshells
full of little Stones, which gingle and rattle as they go, and about their Arms
Armlets call’d <i>Mapouyh-couaychovare</i>; all which are curiously checker’d with various
colour’d Feathers.</p>

because of their Fishing, removing every sixth year, calling the Village where they
Settle, by the former Name.</p>

<h4 id='c518' class='c013'><i>A Relation of the Proceedings of the</i> Netherland West-India <i>Company in</i> Brasile <i>to the Year 1658</i>.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>The chief Disturbers of the <i>Portuguese</i> in the possession of the Countrey of
<i>Brasile</i>, were the <i>United Netherlanders</i>; for they having had good success
with their first Fleet, under the Command of <i>John Molenaer</i>, <i>John Dignumszoon</i>,
<i>John Schelinger</i>, <i>Simon Mau</i>, and the Merchants <i>Cornelis Woodman</i>, <i>Gerard Beveningen</i>,
and <i>Heinier van Hel</i>, Anno 1595. in the <i>East-Indies</i>, where they got such footing, that
they took whole Kingdoms, to the great enriching of the Eastern World, where
they spread their Trade over the whole Countrey, were thereupon emboldned to
venture also to the West, that thereby they might cut off the Sinews of the King of
<i>Spain</i>’s Wars, he being continually supply’d with Treasures from <i>America</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A <i>West-India</i> Company erected by the <i>United States</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>St. Salvador</i> set upon by the <i>Dutch</i> under <i>Peterszoon</i> and <i>Willekens</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>St. Salvador</i> taken by the <i>Dutch</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The grand Promoters of this Design were the Company of Merchants, who hitherto
had Traded to <i>Guinee</i>; and the rather, because <i>Guinee</i> brought them but little
Profit. But to set upon the <i>Spanish</i> Power, was a Business of no small Consequence;
nevertheless they undertaking it, obtain’d Letters Patents from the <i>States</i> of the
<i>United Netherlands</i>, Anno 1621. for erecting of a <i>West-India</i> Company, in which it was
declar’d, That none without the said Companies leave should drive any Trade to
<i>Africa</i> from the Northern <i>Tropick</i>, to the Cape <i>Bonne Esperance</i>; nor to <i>America</i> from
<i>Terre-Neuf</i> to the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>, or <i>Le Maire</i>; nor in the South Sea to <i>Anian</i>;
which if any attempted, they should forfeit Ship and Goods; besides several other
Priviledges and Immunities granted towards the promoting and establishing of the
said Company. After a long Consultation which way to steer their Course, it was
concluded upon in the Council for the Affairs of the Company, to Invade <i>St. Salvador</i>
in the Inlet <i>Todos los Sanctos</i>, whether they sent twenty Men of War and three
Ketches, Commanded by <i>Jacob Willekens</i>, and <i>Peter Peterszoon Hein</i>; the Land Forces
being under the Command of Colonel <i>John van Dorth</i>. In the beginning of the Year
1624. the Fleet set Sail out of the <i>Texel</i> and the <i>Maes</i>, and in five Moneths arriv’d at
<i>St. Salvador</i>. As soon as the <i>Portugueses</i> discover’d the <i>Dutch</i> Fleet, they shot without
ceasing from the Fort <i>Philippo</i> with three Brass Guns, as also from the Castle
<i>Tapagipe</i>, with four Demi-Canons, but chiefly from the Battlement rais’d threesquare
out of the Water before <i>St. Salvador</i>, from whence they play’d at them with
twelve great Guns, whilest the Vice-Admiral ran within Musquet-shot of the said
Battlement with three Ships, and found fifteen <i>Portuguese</i> Vessels lying near the
Shore not far from the Castle <i>Philippo</i>, where there began a sharp Conflict, to the
no small advantage of <i>Peter Hein</i>; who thereupon ventur’d with three Boats to
Board the fifteen Ships: which resolute Attempt of the <i>Dutch</i> Seamen so amaz’d the
<i>Portuguese</i>, that they set their biggest Ships on Fire, and fled ashore: Those Ships
that escap’d, being in all ten, the <i>Hollanders</i> took and brought them to the Fleet.
This flight of the <i>Portuguese</i> encouraging <i>Peter Hein</i>, he went with fourteen Boats,
each Mann’d with two hundred Arm’d Men upon the very Mouths of the Cannons
to the fore-mention’d Battlement and took the same, notwithstanding the
Stone Wall rose eight Foot out of the Water, and above a hundred <i>Portuguese</i> defended
it, whilest the Admiral <i>Willekens</i> sent twelve hundred Soldiers, and two hundred
and forty Seamen ashore with Field-Pieces. The Forlorn-Hope consisted of
sixty Musquetteers, led by Captain <i>Helmond</i>, who was seconded by Lieutenant <i>La
Main</i>, all the Seamen following with Spades and Pick-axes; the Reserve was
brought up by Captain <i>Kyf</i>, <i>Ysenach</i>, and <i>William Schouten</i>; thus drawn out, they
were led towards the City by the Guides <i>Dirk Colver</i> and <i>Dirk de Ruiter</i>, along a narrow
Way, which the <i>Portuguese</i> might have guarded with a few Men, had they not
been all struck with a pannick fear, and making use of the dark Night, fled into
the Woods. The <i>Dutch</i> found in the City an incredible Booty, because the Governor
<i>Diego Mendoza de Furtado</i> had forbid the carrying away of any Goods, that so
the Citizens might be the easier perswaded to defend the City; which they might
well have done, had they not been surpris’d with the suddenness of the Action; for
when <i>Willekens</i> Anchor’d here, there were above sixteen hundred Soldiers, besides a
considerable number of Arm’d Citizens in <i>St. Salvador</i>; besides, in the Forts about
the City on the Walls lay twenty three Brass, and twenty six Iron Guns.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>This Victory was scarce obtain’d, when Colonel <i>Dorth</i>, who had lost the Fleet
at <i>Point Vincent</i>, arriv’d here after all was done, and caus’d Edicts to be publish’d, in
which the fled Citizens were promis’d greater Priviledges under the <i>Netherlanders</i>
Protection, than ever they had under the King of <i>Spain</i>. Whereupon a few <i>Portuguese</i>
return’d to the City; but the greatest part of them, and those the most considerable,
were partly kept back by Command of the Bishop <i>Teixera</i>, who laid the
fault concerning the loss of the City on the Governor <i>Furtado</i>, and partly because
they judg’d the <i>Netherlanders</i> unable to defend them against the <i>Spanish</i> Power.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the same time several rich laden Vessels arriv’d there from <i>Lisbon</i>, <i>Janeiro</i>,
<i>Spirito Santo</i>, <i>Angola</i> and other Places, all ignorant of the Conquest of <i>St. Salvador</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Col. <i>Dorth</i> kill’d by an Ambuscade.</div>

<p class='c010'>Whilest <i>Dorth</i> and <i>Willekens</i> were ordering all things within the City, the outstaying
<i>Portuguese</i> at last taking courage, Storm’d the City from Midnight till the
next day in the Afternoon, but fearing they should be set upon behind unawares,
Retreated; after which <i>Dorth</i> thinking he had been free from all fear of Enemies,
and with a small Guard riding out of the City to take a view of the adjacent Countrey,
was scarce got a Bowe-shot from the Walls, when a great Body of <i>Brasilians</i>
rush’d forth unexpectedly from an Ambuscade, and wounded him so mortally, that
he fell dead from his Horse, and had his Head suddenly chopt off, and his Body
mangled very terribly.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Allart Schouten</i> being chosen Governor in <i>Dorth</i>’s stead, took no care to fortifie the
City; and after his Decease his Brother <i>William Schouten</i> succeeding him, regarded it
less, so that all things went to ruine, every one striving onely to enrich themselves.
Amongst other Booties, they took the rich laden Vessel which <i>Francisco de Sarmiento</i>,
Governor of <i>Chili</i>, brought to <i>St. Salvador</i>, with fifty eight thousand <i>Guilders</i>, and a
much greater sum of Gold and Pearls, all which was imbezled away.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of <i>St. Salvador</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>This City <i>St. Salvador</i>, built by <i>Thomas de Sosa</i> along the Sea-side, runs up broad
at the Suburb <i>Carmo</i>, hath four Market-places, into the biggest whereof, being of a
long square, run nine Streets, the chief of which being very broad, hath many
stately Houses. The second Market-place is of like form, onely it winds a little towards
the Right, and at the Entrance stands a strong Prison. The Cloyster <i>St. Francis</i>,
inhabited by <i>Jesuits</i>, stands in a Park near the Wall by which the Moat runs. Towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>the Sea-side they have a second Structure, much statelier than the <i>Franciscan</i>
Cloyster. Near the Prison stands the Armory, and somewhat farther the great
Church, which <i>Anno 1624.</i> was not quite finish’d. The Church dedicated to the
Virgin <i>Mary</i> appears with a high Spire near the Gate <i>Bento</i>, without which the great
Cloyster <i>Bento</i> is built; but the chief Church is <i>St. Salvador</i>. On the utmost Point
towards the South-West of the City lies the Fort <i>Antonio</i>, between which and the
City stands a very neat Pleasure-house, belonging to the Bishop. Besides <i>Antonio</i>
there are four other considerable Forts, <i>viz.</i> <i>Diego</i>, <i>St. Maria</i>, <i>De Gracia</i>, and <i>Vittoria</i>.
About half way between <i>Vittoria</i> and the Cloyster <i>Bento</i>, stands the Castle with four
Bulwarks; but on the North-side the City is guarded by the Forts <i>St. Peter</i>, <i>Philippo</i>,
and <i>Tapecipe</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A great Fleet set out by the King of <i>Spain</i> for the recovery of <i>St. Salvador</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spanish</i> King seeming exceedingly concern’d at the loss of so eminent a Place,
fitted out a great Fleet for the recovery of what had been taken from him; but the
<i>Netherland West-India</i> Company having notice of it, put themselves into a posture of
Defence, and in a short time made ready eighteen Men of War and seven Ketches,
Mann’d with a thousand six hundred and ninety Seamen, and a thousand three hundred
and fifty Land-Soldiers, <i>John Dirkszoon Lam</i> being Admiral: But news coming
day after day of the extraordinary Preparations in <i>Spain</i>, it was judg’d convenient
to strengthen the Fleet with fourteen Ships and two Ketches more, carrying a thousand
four hundred and thirty Seamen, and five hundred eighty Soldiers, under the
Command of General <i>Boudewyn Henrickszoon</i>, and Admiral <i>Andries Veron</i>. Moreover,
the <i>West-India</i> Company fitted out a third Fleet, consisting of four Frigats and three
Ketches, Commanded by <i>Henry Kat</i>, with Orders to Cruise along the <i>Spanish</i> Coast.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the beginning of the Year 1625. <i>Frederick de Toledo</i> weighed Anchor from
<i>Cales</i> with one and thirty Gallions, four Pinnaces, three Tartans, and a Carvel,
all carrying seventy five hundred Men. The Soldiers were divided into three
Regiments, Commanded by the Colonels <i>Pedro Osorio</i>, <i>Juan Orellana</i>, and the Marquess
<i>De Torreclusa</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>St. Salvador</i> re-taken by the <i>Spaniards</i> from the <i>Hollanders</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Near <i>St. Jago</i> at the <i>African</i> Cape <i>Verde</i>, <i>Toledo</i> joyn’d with the <i>Portuguese</i> Fleet,
consisting of twenty one Gallions and fourteen Carvels and Barques, Mann’d with
four thousand Seamen, two Regiments of Soldiers, Commanded by <i>Antonio Nunnez
Barreio</i>, and <i>Francisco de Almeida</i>; but the chief Commander of this Fleet was <i>Emanuel
Meneses</i>. Which great Fleet being arriv’d at <i>St. Salvador</i>, <i>Toledo</i> himself Landed at
the Fort <i>Antonio</i>, leaving the Command of the Fleet to <i>Juan Fajardo</i>: The first thing
he did, was to set upon the Cloyster <i>Bento</i>; which having gain’d, he left Serjeant
<i>Troppani</i> with two Regiments in the same, whilest he went and Storm’d the <i>Carmelites</i>
Minster, and at last took it; but in the mean time four hundred <i>Hollanders</i> Sallying
out, made a furious Onset upon the two Regiments, who had possession of
the Cloyster <i>Bento</i>, where the <i>Spaniards</i> sustain’d considerable damage; for besides the
wounding of three Captains, and the loss of a great number of Soldiers, there were
slain the Commanders <i>Emanuel Aquitara</i>, <i>Alonso de Gana</i>, <i>Pedro San Stevan</i>, <i>Diego Espinosa</i>,
and Colonel <i>Pedro Osorio</i>; But <i>Toledo</i> no whit dismay’d hereat, but taking fresh
courage, brought twenty nine Demi-Culverins ashore, which fir’d so vehemently
out of the <i>Carmelites</i> and <i>Bento</i>’s Cloysters, on the seventeen <i>Dutch</i> Ships that lay
near the Shore, that several of them were sunk, and others shatter’d beyond hopes
of ever being repair’d. After this the <i>Spanish</i> Army was divided into three several
Parties, which continually fir’d on the City from three new rais’d Works; the
chiefest Party, which was in the <i>Carmelites</i> Minster, had twenty three Brass Guns;
the second, plac’d on the great Wall of the Cloyster <i>Bento</i>, fir’d Night and Day
with eight Demy-Cannons on the City, in which all things were in a confusion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>whilest the Governor <i>William Schouten</i> went unconcern’d from one Tavern to another
railing at the Soldiers, who thereupon mutinying and deposing him, chose
Serjeant <i>Hans Ernst Kyf</i> in his room, who, as he was calling a Council of War, receiv’d
a Summons from <i>Toledo</i> to deliver up the City; at which <i>Kyf</i> being much
surpris’d, sent a Drummer with a Letter to <i>Toledo</i>, desiring him to grant the Besieged
three Weeks time to repair and make fit their batter’d Vessels to carry them
back for <i>Holland</i>; and also that they might, according to Martial Custom, march
out with lighted Matches, flying Colours, Bullets in their Mouths, and with Bag
and Baggage. To which  <i>Toledo</i> return’d Answer, That he was now in his own
Countrey, and had gotten possession of four Fortifications about <i>St. Salvador</i>, on
which he had planted thirty seven Cannons, and therefore saw no such necessity to
grant the Besieged (who could not possibly expect any fresh Supplies) such advantageous
and bold Demands; and onely promis’d them their Lives should be at his
discretion. Yet at last <i>William Stoop</i>, <i>Hugh Antoniszoon</i>, and <i>Francis du Chesne</i> being
sent to the <i>Carmelites</i> Cloyster, agreed with <i>Toledo</i> on these Conditions: <i>That the</i>
Hollanders <i>should surrender</i> St. Salvador <i>in the Condition it was then in, march out unarm’d,
but with Baggage, and have a free Passage with Provisions and all things necessary allow’d them
for their Transportation for</i> Holland. Whereupon on the first of <i>May</i> the City was deliver’d
up to the <i>Spaniards</i> in such disorder, that some of them had taken possession
of the Gate <i>Bento</i>, before those on the other side of the City knew of any Agreement
that was made between <i>Toledo</i> and Colonel <i>Kyf</i>. And thus the Place which
had a whole year been under the Jurisdiction of the <i>Netherlanders</i>, fell again under
the possession of the <i>Spanish</i> Crown, onely through the indiscreet management of the
Commanders; for otherwise it was sufficiently strong, and well stor’d with Ammunition
and Men, being able to make out two thousand. Moreover, the Ketch
<i>De Haes</i>, was set out before from the <i>Holland</i> Fleet, and brought news of the Forces
that were sent from the <i>Netherland</i> Havens to their assistance: But the Ships under
Admiral <i>Lam</i>, as also those under <i>Boudewyn Henriczoon</i>, were stay’d a considerable
time in their Harbors by contrary Winds, and at last reaching the <i>Line</i> were becalm’d,
and through the excessive heat of the Climate many Men lost by raging and
mortal Distempers, insomuch that they reach’d not the Bay <i>Todos los Sanctos</i> before
the twenty sixth of <i>May</i>, on which they saw the <i>Spanish</i> Flag streaming from the
Walls of <i>St. Salvador</i>, and fifty great Ships riding at an Anchor near the Shore.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The City <i>Porto Rico</i> surpriz’d by <i>Henrickszoon</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Capt. <i>Uzeel</i> slain.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Netherland</i> Fleet, divided into four Squadrons, consisted of thirty four Sail,
amongst which <i>Lam</i> carry’d the Flag on the Main-top, the Vice-Admiral <i>Adrian
Cheszoon</i> on the Fore-top, the Rere-Admiral <i>Andries Veron</i> on the Main-mast, and the
Commander of the fourth Squadron on the Mizne-top: All of them seeing the <i>Spaniards</i>
absolute Masters, judg’d it most convenient to put to Sea; but standing a pretty
while to the South, they found that the strong Current drove them to the Shelves
on the West-side of the Inlet; wherefore Tacking about, they made towards the
Enemy, who at first seem’d to meet them with twenty eight great Ships, but returning
towards the City, the <i>Hollanders</i> also stood to Sea again, Steering Southerly,
though without making much advantage in their Way, the Sea going very hollow,
and the strong Current setting them towards the Shore, by which means they were
in no small danger before the River <i>Francisco</i>, where many of the Men dy’d for
want of fresh Provisions, and the number of the Sick increas’d daily, insomuch
that some of the Ships were like to perish for want of Men to guide them: It
was also judg’d dangerous to lie longer with such a great Fleet near a Lea-Shore,
therefore they put into the Inlet <i>Trayciaon</i>, which lies a League to the Northward of
the River <i>Monguapigape</i>, from whence a ridge of Rocks extends to <i>Trayciaon</i>, and being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>overflow’d at High-water, hath three Openings or Entrances, two for great Ships,
and one, the most Northern, for small Vessels to pass through: The Sea also breaking
against this Cliff never molests the Ships whatever Winds blow. The Countrey
is overgrown with Brambles, and hath a Lake two Leagues long, and a quarter
broad, on the opposite Shore of which stood a Village, inhabited by <i>Portugueses</i>
and <i>Brasilians</i>; but the <i>Portugueses</i> flying from thence left the <i>Brasilians</i> in absolute
possession: The <i>Hollanders</i> going thither found thirty Chests of Sugar in one Hut;
after which the Admiral <i>Lam</i> caus’d his sick Men to be brought ashore, whilest the
Captains  <i>Boshuisen</i>, <i>Swart</i>, <i>Dyke</i>, <i>Stapels</i>, and <i>Uzeel</i>, march’d up into the Countrey,
where they got plenty of Oranges and Cattel. In the mean time the Ketch <i>Vosken</i>,
Mann’d with thirty six Seamen, Cruising along the Sea-Coast of <i>Brasile</i>, took three
Ships, one out of the Inlet <i>Todos los Sanctos</i>, laden with Sugar and Tobacco, another
with the same Merchandise from <i>Pernambuco</i>, and the third laden with Wines
from <i>Madera</i>. On the first of <i>August</i> the Fleet set Sail again, to the great sorrow of
the <i>Brasilians</i>, who out of hopes of being protected by them against the <i>Portuguese</i>,
had joyn’d their Forces with theirs; but now being forsaken, they expected nothing
but utter Ruine; which to escape, many of them desir’d to be admitted to go
along with the Fleet, which had been granted them, had not the <i>Hollanders</i> wanted
Provisions for themselves. The Fleet getting off at Sea, the Admiral <i>Veron</i> ran
with twelve Sail to the Coast of <i>Africa</i>; and <i>Boudewyn Henrickszoon</i> kept eighteen
Ships under his Command, the rest returning home with Admiral <i>Lam</i>: and thus
the Fleet left the unfortunate Haven <i>Trayciaon</i>, where above seven hundred <i>Dutch</i>
Seamen were bury’d. <i>Boudewyn Henrickszoon</i> refreshing at <i>Cape St. Vincent</i>, steer’d
Westerly, when a Storm (which in twenty four hours blew from all Points of the
Compass) surprising him, broke his Main-mast, separated the whole Fleet, and
sunk the <i>Flushing</i> Frigat; at last getting beyond the Isle <i>Virgin Gorda</i>, the Fleet meeting
again, got to <i>Juan de Porto Rico</i> about the latter end of <i>September</i>; into whose
Haven <i>Henrickszoon</i> Sail’d with great courage, notwithstanding the narrow Mouth
thereof was guarded by a strong Fort full of Brass Guns, which fir’d very fiercely
upon him, who on the other side was not idle in discharging his Guns on the Fort;
and had not the shallow Water before the City prevented his Landing that day, he
had gotten a far greater Booty than afterwards he met with; for the Inhabitants
had, during the Low-water, remov’d all their best Goods: but the next Morning
before Sun-rising, the Admiral Landed with eight hundred Men, march’d into the
City without any resistance, pitch’d the <i>States</i> Flag on the Governor’s House, guarded
all Avenues, unhoop’d all the Wine-Casks which he found there, for fear his
Men should make themselves Drunk therewith, and so neglect their Duty, fir’d
from the Land-side towards the Castle with three Brass Guns, gain’d the Redoubt,
built for the security of the Bridge, which unites the small Isle on which
<i>Porto Rico</i> is built with the great, rais’d a Platform, from whence he fir’d Day and
Night with six Cannons, guarded by Captain <i>Thyene</i>, whilest the Commander <i>Uzeel</i>
kept Watch near the Fort; but his Men being most of them sick, he could not do
any great Exploits, especially since the <i>Spaniards</i> Sallying out, as they did daily,
kill’d many of the <i>Hollanders</i>, and amongst them Captain <i>Uzeel</i>, after he had shot
down two Turrets from the Castle, which damage the Enemy repair’d by taking
several of the <i>Hollanders</i> Boats; by which means they could not prevent fresh Supplies
from going to the Castle; the Besiegers in the mean time beginning daily to
be in greater want for Ammunition and Provisions: whereupon <i>Henrickszoon</i>
judg’d it convenient to sound a Retreat, after he had set the Ships belonging to
the City <i>Porto Rico</i> on fire in four places. In which Retreat he receiv’d so many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>farewel Shots from the Fort, that they were forc’d to go to the Leeward to stop
their Leaks, and leave one of their Ships to the Enemy, in lieu whereof the <i>West-Capel</i>
Frigat took a Barque with four Brass Guns, in the little Haven <i>Sierra Gorda</i>;
from whence the Fleet ran into the Western Bay of the Island <i>Porto Rico</i>, where
whilest they repair’d and took in fresh Provisions, <i>Henrickszoon</i> sent the Ships <i>Hester</i>
and <i>Jonas</i> richly laden for <i>Holland</i>; the remaining part of the Fleet meeting with
strong contrary Tydes at <i>Porto Rico</i>, were necessitated to put into the Inlet <i>Francisco</i>,
where they made several Marches up into the Countrey, to the loss of many of their
Men, which were kill’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>, lying in Ambuscade amongst the Brambles
that grew along by the Ways.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fort of <i>Margarita</i> taken by <i>Henrickszoon</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Henrickszoon</i> dying, is succeeded by <i>Adrian Cheszoon</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the middle of <i>January</i>, Anno 1626. <i>Henrickszoon</i> Sailing about the North of
<i>Porto Rico</i>, steer’d to <i>Dominico</i>, and from thence along the Isles <i>Martinigo</i>, <i>Luzia</i>, and
the Promontory <i>De tres Puntas</i>, towards the Island <i>Margarita</i>, where Landing, and
Storming the Castle on the Land-side with fifteen Men, he gain’d the first Breastworks;
but the <i>Spaniards</i> stopping up the Way along which they were to return,
they had without doubt been all slain, had not the Captains <i>Stapel</i> and <i>Estienne</i> come
to their assistance; for the <i>Spaniards</i> seeing them climbing up the Bulwarks, betook
them to their Heels, after they had kill’d nine of the fore-mention’d fifteen, amongst
whom were the Captains <i>Urk</i> and <i>Molkman</i>: of those that leap’d over into the Ditch
most part escap’d; those few that were taken inform’d the <i>Hollanders</i>, That the
Way towards the Village, inhabited by <i>Spaniards</i>, was every where stopt up with
Barricado’s, through which none were able to pass. <i>Henrickszoon</i> thus become Master
of the Fort, sent the Booty which he had gotten there, together with three Brass,
and five Iron Guns, aboard of his Ship, blew up the Fort, burnt all the Houses,
and ran into the Haven <i>Muchina</i>, to which he gave the Denomination of <i>Port Maurice</i>;
where, besides a great number of dry’d Fish, he took forty Tun of Salt out of
one Salt-pit. After this he taking in fresh Provisions at <i>St. Fe</i>, discover’d <i>Aves</i>, a
low Isle full of high Trees, took above two hundred Sheep, and abundance of red
Wood on <i>Bonaire</i>, and before the Coast a <i>Spanish</i> Frigat richly laden, made Inspections
into the Havens of <i>Hispaniola</i> and <i>Jamaica</i>; from whence he fell back on the
Coast of <i>Porto Rico</i>, about the Island <i>Mona</i>, where discovering four <i>Spanish</i> Ships, he
took three of them, and burnt the fourth; he also got abundance of Tortoises and
Crocodiles on the great <i>Caiman</i>, and took a new Ship between the little sandy Isles
<i>Caios</i>, as also before <i>Cuba</i> a Barque, which inform’d him, That the Fleet from the
<i>Honduras</i>, as also that from <i>New Spain</i>, was daily expected at <i>Havana</i>: Thence Sailing
into the Haven <i>Cabannas</i>, he took a new Vessel of a hundred Tun, and abundance
of Timber and Carpenters Tools on the Shore; he Landed also with seven hundred
Men on the East-side of the Haven, from whence he march’d along a narrow
Path a League up into the Countrey, where he found a running Stream, Pastures
full of Cattel, and a Village, the Inhabitants whereof being warn’d by the Barking
of their Dogs, fled, and left all manner of fresh Provisions to the <i>Hollanders</i>, viz.
above two thousand Oranges, abundance of Lemmons, <i>Bananas</i>, Hogs, Calves, and
Bacon; all which having sent aboard, they burnt the Village: After this they took
a <i>Spanish</i> Barque before <i>Havana</i>, as also a Ship laden with Timber, another Barque
with Poultry, <i>Cochenile</i>, Money, and Haberdashery Ware, one Vessel with live Tortoises,
and another, full of Salt, dry’d Fish, and some Merchandise. While the
Fleet was thus Cruising up and down before <i>Havana</i>, the Admiral <i>Henrickszoon</i>
dy’d; a Man of most approv’d Valor, and of great Conduct: After which <i>Adrian
Cheszoon</i> carry’d the Flag; but the Men mutinying about the dividing of the Provisions,
which began to grow very scarce, all things fell into great disorder; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>Seamen rebell’d against their Commanders, saying, <i>That they had been out long enough,
and that they would not stay waiting any longer for the Fleet from</i> New Spain <i>or</i> Honduras:
Wherefore steering Home, they all arriv’d safe at the <i>Texel</i> and other places in
<i>Holland</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In our foregoing Relation we have given you an Account of the Fleet which
came to assist the City of <i>St. Salvador</i>, divided into two Squadrons; eighteen Sail
<i>Boudewyn Henrickszoon</i> kept under his Command, and twelve Sail remain’d in the
Admiral <i>Veron</i>’s Squadron, who Sail’d to the Inlet <i>Serre Leona</i>, where he found the
Admiral <i>John Dirkszoon Lam</i> with three Ships, which had lay’n there above two
Moneths, by reason of the Sickness amongst the Seamen.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A strange kind of Baboon.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Frambore</i>, King of this Place, granted <i>Lam</i> and <i>Veron</i> free liberty to Hunt, and to
gather as many Oranges and Lemmons as they pleas’d, with which the Seamen
were so refresh’d, that they set Sail again, and amongst many other things carry’d a
Baboon with them from <i>Sierra Leona</i>, which so exactly resembled a Man, that it
was wonderful to behold, having a Body, Hands, Eyes, Ears, Feet, and Actions
like a Man, smoak’d Tobacco amongst the Seamen, made a noise like a Child when
beaten. The Inhabitants of <i>Sierra Leona</i>, where these Monsters run in great Companies
through the Woods, believe that the Souls of the Deceased reside in them.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>John de Laet</i>, in his annual Journal of the Transactions of the <i>West-India</i> Company,
affirms, That he saw a Female of these monstrous Creatures, which usually
had her monethly Flowers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Hollanders</i> ill success before the Castle <i>Del Mine</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Fleet, as is before mention’d, Sailing from <i>Sierra Leona</i>, came to an Anchor
at <i>Commany</i>, and Landed twelve hundred Men at <i>Poquena</i>, besides a hundred and
fifty <i>Negro</i>’s; which Regiment <i>Andries Veron</i> and <i>Arend Jacobszoon</i> carry’d to the
Castle <i>Del Mine</i>, whither they before sent a Company, Commanded by <i>Hans Gryf</i>,
to prevent the Sallies of the Enemy. The <i>Hollanders</i> tir’d and thirsty, Encamp’d
themselves near the Fort, and whilest some of the Men were seeking for Water,
others smoaking Tobacco, and lying without their Arms and in disorder on the
Ground, and the Commanders were taking a view of the Fort from a neighboring
Hill, two hundred <i>Negro</i>’s fell upon the scatter’d Army with great rage and fury,
and so much the greater, in regard the <i>Portuguese</i> had promis’d them great sums of
Money for every <i>Hollander</i> they kill’d: never any Army was in such a distraction,
they being dispers’d and kill’d like so many Sheep, the Admiral <i>Veron</i> and all the
Officers slain, and in a short time four hundred and forty Men cut off; and had
not Captain <i>Arend Jacobszoon</i> been in League with the Inhabitants of <i>Commany</i>, whither
the routed Regiments fled, not one Man had escap’d that bloody Slaughter:
Nor was it to much purpose to Besiege the Castle <i>Del Mine</i>, because the Bullets hitting
against the Walls of the Castle, built all of Rock-stones, did no Execution.
But the four Ships inform’d of this miserable destruction, fell down to <i>Commany</i>,
to fetch those that were left alive, and return’d home with the other eleven.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the unfortunate Expedition of this Fleet, the <i>West-India Company</i> fitted out
nine great Ships and five Ketches in the beginning of the Year 1626. under the
Command of <i>Peter Peterszoon Hein</i>, to Cruise for the <i>Spanish</i> Ships that were expected
from <i>New Spain</i> and <i>Honduras</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Fox</i> Frigat being sent before to inform <i>Henrickszoon</i> of <i>Heyn</i>’s coming, reach’d
about the latter end of <i>May</i> beyond the Isles <i>Dominico</i>, <i>Guadalupa</i>, <i>Mevis</i>, <i>St. Christophers</i>,
and by <i>Santa Crux</i>; there not finding a Harbor on the South-side, because of
the Rocks, she Sail’d from <i>Mona</i> over to the Main Coast, where seven Leagues Westward
of <i>Carakess</i>, he discover’d a high broken Land, whose Mountains seem’d to
reach to the Clouds; from thence she steer’d to the Promontory <i>Caldera</i>, the Isles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span><i>Margareta</i> and <i>Coche</i>, on which last he took abundance of Goats, not without the
loss of forty six Men, kill’d by the <i>Spaniards</i> and <i>Indians</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mean while the Admiral <i>Peter Heyn</i>, in the beginning of <i>June</i>, Sail’d to the
Southward of <i>Barbados</i>, an Island pretty mountainous, as hath been formerly mention’d,
and full of Woods, and by <i>Martinino</i>, whose Hills are very high and overgrown
with Trees. Here <i>Peter Heyn</i> could get nothing else but sweet Water, and
a Fruit resembling a green Grape, which grew on a round Leav’d Tree, whose
Juice cur’d the Scurvey. Sailing from hence, and Landing on <i>Guadalupa</i>, he found
a <i>Canoo</i> seven Fathom long and one broad, and cut out of one Tree. The Inhabitants,
a well timber’d People, went stark naked, and desir’d to be excus’d, that they
could not furnish the <i>Hollanders</i> with more Provisions, because the <i>French</i> and <i>English</i>,
Inhabitants of <i>St. Christophers</i>, had pillag’d them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Success of the <i>Dutch</i> against the <i>Portuguese</i> Fleet.</div>

<p class='c010'>Near <i>Mona</i> the <i>Fox</i> Frigat joyn’d with the Fleet, with information, that he could
hear no tydings of <i>Henrickszoon</i>; wherefore <i>Peter Heyn</i> judg’d it convenient to Sail
along the South-Coast of <i>Hispaniola</i> with a separated Fleet, which was to joyn again
near the great <i>Caiman</i>. Near <i>Cape de Corientes</i> the <i>Dutch</i> took a <i>Spanish</i> Ship laden with
<i>Sarsaparilla</i>; after that another with Salt and Fish, and on the Shelves before <i>Coche</i>
before the Promontory <i>Antonio</i>, a Fly-boat with Tallow and Hides, and at the
same places two Vessels more with Ballast, the Men whereof inform’d him, that
the Fleet from <i>New Spain</i> had about a Moneth before weigh’d Anchor from the
Haven <i>Juan de Ulva</i>, and set Sail to <i>Havana</i>, so that without doubt they were arrived
there; wherefore <i>Peter Heyn</i> steer’d towards <i>Tortugos</i>, in hopes, if he could, to
overtake some of the heavy Sailers. Before the Promontory <i>De Florida</i> he discover’d
seven Sail, and coming up nearer, above thirty, which, had <i>Henrickszoon</i> been
united with <i>Peter Heyn</i>, had without doubt fallen into the hands of the <i>Netherlanders</i>;
but it being judg’d a madness to set upon so great a Fleet with so small a number of
Ships, they Sail’d away undisturb’d. <i>Peter Heyn</i> steer’d his Course along <i>Florida</i>,
where he met three <i>Canoos</i> with strange Men in them, who came aboard of him,
their Bodies being naked, were painted with several colours, onely Mats of Rushes
about their Middle, and on their Backs long Tassels hanging down: their Merchandise
consisted of a sort of Gum of little value. The <i>Netherlanders</i> in this Place
took also a Vessel with <i>Sina</i> Leaves, and some pounds of Ambergreece: but the
Scurvey increasing daily amongst them, they Tack’d about, and ran to an Anchor
at <i>Sierra Leona</i>, where they stay’d till the latter end of <i>January 1627.</i> and then set Sail
to <i>Brasile</i>, and overtook a Vessel from <i>Madera</i> laden with a hundred and fifty Pipes
of Wine, and other rich Goods, and ran into the Inlet <i>Todos los Sanctos</i> with undaunted
courage, not regarding the Guns that were fir’d from the Fort and Battlements
of the City <i>St. Salvador</i>, near which lay thirty Sail of Ships, to which he making up,
steer’d between the <i>Portuguese</i> Admiral and Rere-Admiral, whom sinking, he forc’d
the Admiral to surrender, whilest the <i>Hollandia</i> and <i>Gelria</i> Frigats fell upon the rest,
which were forsaken by the Seamen, who leap’d over-board; then several Mann’d
Boats of the <i>Hollanders</i> (notwithstanding the Enemy’s continual firing) went and
fetch’d off twenty two Sail of the <i>Portuguese</i> Vessels; all which they did in three
hours time, onely with the loss of fifty Men, besides some that were wounded,
amongst whom was the Admiral, being shot with a Bullet through the Arm, and
wounded in the Legs with a Splinter; his Ship also was, with the <i>Gelria</i> Frigat,
driven with the Spring-Tide on a Bank, whence, after the <i>Gelria</i> had receiv’d above
sixty Shot from the Enemy, they both got off at last; but the Admiral’s Frigat being
shot in a manner to a Wreck, was set on fire, which Misfortune ended not there,
for the <i>Orange-tree</i> Frigat blew up, with sixty Men, fourteen whereof, though miserably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>scorch’d, had their Lives sav’d. Soon after which the Admiral sent into
<i>Holland</i> the Ship <i>St. Peter</i>, the <i>Hoop</i>, <i>Nostra Sennora de la Vittoria</i>, and the <i>Black-Lyon</i>,
which besides their Lading of Hides, Silver, Gold, and Precious Stones, were
most of them full of Sugar; which safely arriving, did not a little encourage the
<i>West-India</i> Company. After this <i>Heyn</i> took two Ships with Slaves from <i>Angola</i>,
which because the Governor of <i>St. Salvador</i> would not redeem, were put ashore on
<i>Taperica</i>. On the last of <i>March</i> he set Sail from the Inlet <i>Todos los Sanctos</i>, pass’d by
<i>Morro Pablo</i>, and on <i>Easter</i> Eve with a strong Gale by the <i>Abrolhos</i>: before the Highland
between <i>Cape Frio</i> and the River <i>De Jenero</i>, he discover’d two Sail, one whereof
being laden with Sugar was taken, but the other escap’d in the Night; then Sailing
on to the meandring Stream <i>Spirito Sancto</i>, he digg’d Pits on some of the River-Isles
to get fresh Water, because it was not safe to Land on the Continent on each
side, because the Inhabitants shot frequent showers of Arrows from the Thickets,
in which they lay ambuscaded. Moreover the Town <i>Spirito Sancto</i> sent off several
Fire-ships at the time of Flood, but they being easily quench’d did no harm. Here
also a Vessel laden at <i>Lisbon</i> with Wines and Piece-Goods, was taken by <i>Heyn</i>, who
setting Sail again divided the Fleet into three Squadrons, the Vice-Admiral <i>Cornelis
Oole</i> keeping three Ships to Cruise withal before the River <i>La Plata</i>, <i>Henrick
Best</i> had one Frigat, a Ketch, and a Carvel, to guard the Mouth of the Stream <i>Jenero</i>,
whilest the Admiral himself Sail’d with four Frigats, three Ketches, and a Barque,
towards the Inlet <i>Todos los Sanctos</i>, where two Ships riding near the Shore by the
Fort <i>Tapecipe</i>, were by him set on fire. Also taking a Barque he was inform’d, that
six laden Vessels lay in the River <i>Tapecipe</i>, whither he sending some Boats to explore
the truth, they found a great Ship without Men in the Mouth of the Stream, and
half a League farther six <i>Portuguese</i> Vessels lying near the Shore; bringing back
news thereof to the Admiral, he went aboard of the <i>Fox</i> Ketch the next Morning,
and taking two Ketches and several Boats with him, Sail’d up the River, and perceiv’d
that the fore-mention’d six Ships were gotten up higher, and were Mann’d
with a hundred and fifty Soldiers, Commanded by Captain <i>Padilha</i>; the <i>Portuguese</i>
Admiral lying in Ambuscade, no sooner perceiv’d the <i>Netherlanders</i> Boats, but he
let flie a whole Volley of small Shot at them, insomuch that it made them Retreat,
and their whole Design had been fruitless, had not <i>Heyn</i> animated his Men to board
the Vice-Admiral; which encouragement prov’d so successful that they master’d the
same, killing all those that fell into their hands; which so amaz’d the two Vessels
that lay by, that all the Men swam ashore, and left their rich Lading to the disposal
of the <i>Hollanders</i>, besides which the vanquish’d Party lost above a hundred and fifty
Men, and the Conquerors but fifteen. Somewhat farther up lay three Ships more,
but the River being dry there at Low-water, and so narrow that the Trees on each
Shore could touch one another, <i>Heyn</i> judg’d it convenient to prosecute the Design
no farther, but to return with the three fore-mention’d Prizes, which he did not
without great difficulty; for the <i>Portuguese</i> had rais’d Battlements on each side of
the Mouth of the River <i>Tapecipe</i>, and stopt the same with a sunk Vessel, which <i>Heyn</i>
himself set on fire at Low-water, and return’d untouch’d through thick Volleys of
Shot, which flew about his Ears to the Fleet, leaving the three Ships to be fetcht
off afterwards; to which end he commanded that they should hang some of the
taken Hides about the <i>Fox</i> Ketch’s Pinnace, the Carvel and Boats, that so the Men
which were in them might stand secure from the small Shot, and the rather, because
the Ships could not be got out of the shallow and narrow River but by Toeing.
Mean while the Governor of <i>St. Salvador</i> lay with a considerable number of
Citizens and Soldiers behind the fore-mention’d Battlements, not doubting but to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>take revenge for the Losses sustain’d by <i>Heyn</i>; who nevertheless coming down thither
Toed out the three Prize-ships with Boats hung about with Hides, firing into
the Enemies Battlements with his great Guns, which he had put aboard of the <i>Fox</i>
Ketch. About the middle of <i>June</i> he took in the Prize-goods in view of the City
<i>St. Salvador</i>, where seven <i>Netherland</i> Ships from several places lay at an Anchor.
Setting Sail from hence on the fourteenth of <i>July</i>, and reaching <i>Noronho</i>, known by
a Mountain which appears like a Steeple, he met with <i>Cornelis Oole</i>’s Fleet, (who
had been Cruising before <i>La Plata</i>) with whom he arriv’d safe in the <i>Texel</i>, having
in their Way thither from <i>Noronho</i> taken a Prize, laden with Sugar, Tobacco, and
<i>Brasile</i> Wood.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Thomas Sickes</i> his Expedition.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Henrick Lucifer</i> set out by the <i>West-India</i> Company.</div>

<p class='c010'>During <i>Peter Heyn</i>’s Expedition <i>Thomas Sickes</i>, fitted out by the <i>West-India</i> Company,
weighed Anchor out of the <i>Texel</i> with two Sail, and coming to <i>St. Vincent</i> he
found a <i>Spanish</i> Vessel burnt down to the Hulk, took a <i>Portuguese</i> Pink with Slaves
from <i>Angola</i>: Near the Inlet <i>Todos los Sanctos</i> he sunk a Barque, having first taken
several Pots of Oyl and Packs of Linnen out of the same: Before <i>Pernambuco</i> he
took a Carvel with a hundred and eighty Pipes of Wine, and a Vessel with Sugar
and Hides, and drove another ashore against the Promontory <i>St. Augustine</i>. But
<i>Sickes</i> being supply’d and strengthned by three Ships from the <i>Texel</i>, and four taken
Vessels, ran with four to <i>Todos los Sanctos</i>, sent two to Cruise about <i>Cape St.
Augustine</i>, and two more to the North of <i>Pernambuco</i>; At the Isle <i>Noronho</i> they were
order’d to stay a Moneth one for another, from whence, after much hardship, they
return’d home with so many rich Prizes, that they pay’d their Charges ten times
double; which so encourag’d the Adventurers, that the Chamber of the <i>West-India</i>
Company in <i>Zealand</i> fitted out three Sail under the Command of <i>Henrick Lucifer</i>,
who weighing Anchor from <i>Flushing</i> Anno 1627. steer’d along the Coast of <i>Africa</i>
to the <i>Amazone</i> River, and from thence North North-West to the Stream <i>Wiapoco</i>,
to settle a Colony there; to which purpose Rowing up the River with Sloops, they
came in the Night to two empty Houses, built at a place call’d <i>Wacogenive</i>, which
they judg’d fit for their purpose; wherefore they carry’d all things ashore which
they had brought out of <i>Zealand</i> with them for the new Planters, who while they
were all busie building of Huts, a <i>Negro</i> was taken Prisoner, who being ask’d why
the Inhabitants fled? reply’d, That it was occasion’d from a guilty Conscience;
for two years before a Barque and two Sloops with <i>Christians</i> coming thither from
the <i>Amazone</i> River, had stay’d thirty days on <i>Wacogenive</i>, when unawares they were
set upon by the Natives, and all kill’d except three, who were yet living. Upon
which <i>Lucifer</i>, having four <i>Indians</i>, three Men and one Woman, aboard of his Vessel,
threatned to put them all to the Sword, unless they would produce the three foremention’d
<i>Christians</i>: Whereupon the next day a <i>German</i> came to the Water side,
of whom they could get little Information, he having in a manner forgot his native
Tongue; but at length the other two coming thither, the eldest of them, nam’d
<i>John Hendricszoon</i>, related to him, That the <i>Portuguese</i> in great numbers fell upon
the Plantations near the <i>Amazone</i> River, Govern’d by Captain <i>Oudaen</i>, who after he
had fought valiantly a whole day, being overpower’d by number, retreated to his
Barque, and Sail’d into the Creek inhabited by the <i>English</i>, whither the <i>Portuguese</i>
following in <i>Canoos</i>, cut off not onely <i>Oudaen</i>, but the <i>English</i> also, forty six Men
onely escaping in a Barque under the Command of Lieutenant <i>Peter de Bruine</i> to
the River <i>Wiapoco</i>; where they had stay’d about three days, when Sergeant <i>Matruit</i>
treacherously shot Lieutenant <i>Bruine</i>: after which the forty six divided themselves
into four Parties; but the Inhabitants to rid themselves of these Strangers,
under the shew of great friendship, made them Drunk with the Liquor call’d <i>Pernau</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>and then murder’d them all, except himself and two <i>Germans</i>. Which villanous act
<i>Lucifer</i> judg’d worthy of punishment; but his Orders being to shew Kindness and
Civility to the Inhabitants, he suffer’d the Murder to go unpunish’d, but built a triangular
Fort near the River <i>Wiapoco</i>, on a Hill eight Fathom above the Shore, to
prevent the passing by of Sloops; which done, he went to visit the Island <i>Blanco</i>,
where he caught three hundred Goats. From thence he went to the Bay of <i>Honda</i>,
the Inhabitants whereof are a valiant People, tall of Stature, having long Beards,
and wearing Copper Rings through their Ears. Near the Sea-side is a Salt-pan, of
which the Inhabitants make great benefit. <i>Lucifer</i> setting Sail again from hence,
met with three Ketches sent out by the <i>West-India</i> Company at <i>Amsterdam</i>, before
<i>Corientes</i>. The Commander <i>Dirk Simonszoon van Uitgeest</i>, steering his Course towards
the Promontory <i>St. Anton</i>, took a Frigat laden with Meal, Silk, and other
rich Goods, and within view of <i>Cuba</i> near the River <i>Poros</i>, descrying two brave
Gallions from <i>Honduras</i>, bore up to them with his three Ketches; one of which,
call’d <i>The Lyon</i>, being got betwixt both the Gallions, was in no small danger, the
<i>Netherlanders</i> not being able to get up out of their little Vessel into the high Gallions,
in which the <i>Spaniards</i> stood pushing them down with their Pikes; but no sooner
did the <i>Netherlanders</i> throw their Hand-Granado’s amongst them, but <i>Uitgeest</i> got
aboard of the Gallion, and carry’d her off, whilest the other by nimble Sailing got
away. With this Prize <i>Uitgeest</i> thinking himself sufficiently enrich’d, steer’d homewards.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Joost Johnson</i> and <i>Claes Henrickszoon</i>, Commanding each of them a Ketch, took
a Ship coming from <i>Lisbon</i> before <i>Pernambuco</i>, laden with Meal, Salt, Wine, and
thirty Monks; and not long after a Pink with six hundred <i>Negro</i>’s, a Barque with
Salt and Iron, a Ketch with Wine, and a Frigat with <i>Brasile</i> Wood, Sugar and Tobacco:
Before <i>Itamerica</i> they took two Prizes more; with all which they return’d
to the <i>Texel</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Peter Adrianszoon</i>’s Expedition.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>West-India</i> Company thus enrich’d by the Spoil taken from their Enemies,
fitted out twelve Ships again under the Command of <i>Peter Adrianszoon Ita</i>, which
set Sail in the beginning of the Year 1628. and anchor’d first before <i>Blanca</i>, an Isle
abounding with Goats, the Ground stonie, and in some places Rocky, and having a
small, but very convenient Haven, from whence <i>Ita</i> ran beyond <i>Porto Rico</i>, where
he took a Vessel with seven thousand weight of Ginger, and Landed opposite to
<i>Hispaniola</i> on the stonie Isle <i>Catalina</i>, where he took in fresh Water, and then Cruis’d
to and again before <i>Cuba</i>, took six Barques, the Prisoners whereof inform’d him,
That the <i>Honduras</i> Traders were on their Way coming thither, and that they had
two small Men of War for their Convoy: Not long after <i>Ita</i> discover’d them
Sailing along the Shore towards the Haven of <i>Havana</i>, but before they could get in,
Captain <i>John Peters</i>, whose Ketch carry’d two Brass, and fourteen Iron Guns, boarded
the Vice-Admiral, but having no Graplings to take hold with, the <i>Spanish</i> Ship
ran aground, as likewise <i>John Peterszoon</i> in the pursuit of him; which the Admiral
seeing, came to assist his Vice-Admiral, and ran aground on one side of <i>John Peters</i>,
which drove the <i>Netherlanders</i> Ketch in great danger, she not being able to do Execution
with her small Guns, whilest the <i>Spaniards</i> with their Demy-Cannon play’d
vehemently upon her; neither was <i>Ita</i>, by reason of calmness and contrary Tide,
able to come up with them, but was forc’d to stand Northerly, that so he might
get an Easterly Wind, which about Noon always blows fresh here, and so by degrees
got near the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet, till at last coming up with the Vice-Admiral, call’d
<i>St. Jago</i>, he threw Fire-pots into her, and presently after boarding her, enter’d with
that Valor, that of three hundred <i>Spaniards</i> above a hundred and fifty were slain;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>for those that leapt over-board were kill’d in the Water, whilest <i>Joachim Guyszoon</i>,
<i>John Braems</i>, and <i>Anthony Gonde</i> fell upon the Admiral <i>Sennora de los Remedios</i>, and
took her. In both these Ships <i>Ita</i> took Two thousand five hundred Chests of Indigo,
above Six thousand Hides, Two thousand five hundred Packs of <i>Sarsaparilla</i>,
several Pots of Balsam Oyl, Seventy thousand Pound of Ginger, One and twenty
Bars of Silver, Twelve Brass, and Twenty eight Iron Guns; all which having
taken out, he set fire in both the Ships.</p>

<p class='c010'>A little before this Victory, the <i>Fortune</i> Frigat weighed Anchor from <i>Flushing</i>,
with sixty three Men of War, to be Landed on the Island <i>Tabago</i>. At <i>St. Vincent</i>
they found two Men that were left of seven, who having setled along the River
<i>Wiapow</i>, under Captain <i>John Van Ryen</i>, were forc’d by the salvage Natives to remove,
two whereof dyed by the way, the remaining five landing on the Isle <i>Trinidad</i>, had
three of their Companions kill’d by the <i>Indians of Granada</i>, they being <i>French-men</i>,
to whom the Natives bore an inveterate Hatred, so that they left onely the two
<i>Hollanders</i> alive. The <i>Fortune</i> assisted by the <i>South-star</i> Ketch, took a rich Barque
near the <i>Isles des Virgines</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Vitgeest</i>’s Exploits.</div>

<p class='c010'>Not long after the <i>West-India</i> Company set out twelve Ships more, under the
Command of <i>Derick Simonszon Uitgeest</i>, (who had the year before brought home the
two fore-mention’d great Prizes,) who setting Sayl and getting into the large Bay
of the Rocky Island <i>Vincent</i>, catch’d several Goats and Tortels. Before the Coast
of <i>Brasile</i> he took two rich <i>Carvels</i>, one from <i>Pernambuco</i>, and another from the Inlet
<i>Todos los Sanctos</i>; which Prizes having sent home with three Ketches, he sayl’d
towards <i>Sierra Leona</i>, known by high and thick Woods, which grow on a high
Coast; from whence returning again to <i>Pernambuco</i>, he took six rich laden Vessels,
amongst which was one Gallioon from <i>Goa</i>, with a great Treasure of Diamonds.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Peter Hein</i>’s Expedition.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>He gives chace to the <i>Spanish</i> Plate-Fleet, &amp; takes several of them.</div>

<p class='c010'>These successful Expeditions of the Fleets set out from time to time by the
<i>West-India</i> Company, enabled and encourag’d them to undertake Matters of greater
consequence, <i>viz.</i> They fitted out one and thirty Sail, which carryed four thousand
Men, one hundred and thirty Brass Guns, and five hundred fifty eight Iron
Guns; of which <i>Peter Peterszoon Hein</i> being Admiral, took near the Soundings of
<i>Tortuga</i>, two Barques from <i>Havana</i>, the Men whereof inform’d him, that the Plate-Fleet
was not yet arriv’d there, nor that from <i>Terra Firma</i>, but were both expected
every day. The strong Current drove <i>Peter Hein</i> farther Eastward beyond <i>Havana</i>
than he expected, insomuch that he got sight of <i>Matanca</i>, where he overtook a
Barque sent out by <i>Landronce de Cabrera</i>, Governor of <i>Havana</i>, to give notice to the
Plate Fleet of the <i>Hollanders</i> Ships, which he had seen from the Castle <i>Morro</i> before
<i>Havana</i>: Mean while <i>John Van Hoorn</i> took a Vessel which was sent out before by
the Plate Fleet, the Men whereof inform’d him that the Fleet it self was near at
hand; which <i>Peter Hein</i> found to be true, when the next Morning before Sun-rising
he descry’d ten Sayl, of which some had ignorantly sayled to Leeward, and others
to Windward of the <i>Dutch</i> Fleet; nine of them which were Laden with Hides,
Meal, Campeche-Wood, Cochinele, Indigo, and other rich Goods, were taken by
several Mann’d Sloops, because the Ships were not able to come up to them by
reason of the Calm. About Noon <i>Peter Hein</i> discovering nine Gallions more,
made sudden Chace after them; which they perceiving, made toward the Shore,
and about Twilight in the Evening they ran aground in the Bay of <i>Matanca</i>, where
the Commanders Landing saved themselves, each carrying with him what Jewels
they could. About Break of Day <i>Peter Hein</i> made all the Sayl he could possible to
come up with them, and seeing them fast aground, leapt into a Boat and Rowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>up to the Admiral, who fired eight Guns, whilest his Men got ashore: <i>Hein</i> approaching
the Gallioon, saw no way to get up, till at last one of his Men spying a
Rope, climb’d up the same, and made fast other Ropes for his Companions to get
up by, the <i>Spaniards</i> standing still gaping upon him, as if their feet and hands had
been ty’d, which made <i>Peter Hein</i> grant them their Lives; which the other Gallions
seeing, surrender’d themselves upon promise of Quarter; by which the <i>Spanish</i>
Crown lost, besides the Musk, Bezoar, Ambergreece, and the Cargo of two
Gallioons and a rich Prize, above One hundred and fifty Tun of Gold.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Night succeeding this great Victory being somewhat Tempestuous, drove
the Gallioons from the Bank on which they stuck the Day before, into deeper Water:
Five Days they spent in unlading of the taken Vessels, after which <i>Peter Hein</i>
set Sayl with four Gallioons, a new <i>Spanish</i> Merchant-Man, and his own Fleet, out
of the Bay of <i>Matanca</i>, on the Seventh of September, <i>Anno 1628.</i> for <i>Holland</i>, where
in a short time he safely arriv’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Expedition of <i>Lucas Pol</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Tyger</i> Frigat sent from <i>Zealand</i>, and Commanded by <i>Lucas Pol</i>, Anchor’d before
<i>Blanca</i>, where he brought away above five hundred Goats: This Island which
is six Leagues in circumference, hath on the West a Sandy Inlet, fit for great Ships
to Ride at Anchor; Moreover, it is deep and Rocky, in the Valleys the Grass
grows above half a Mans length. The Woods are overgrown with Thorns; the
Soyl also would produce much more fruit, did not the Rats, <i>Leguanes</i>, Hedge-hogs,
and other Animals, devour and spoil the Plants.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Pol</i> leaving this Island ran to <i>Tortuga</i>, a low Isle, except on the West side; it produces
<i>Guaiacum</i>, or Pock-wood, in great abundance, and nourishes great Flocks of
Goats, and hath an eminent Salt-Pan; in all which things it is parallel’d with the
Island <i>Orchilla</i>, known by its high Mountains on the East and West; the other part
thereof not being above six Foot above the Water: <i>Pol</i> Landing here, carry’d off
above two hundred Goats near the Western Shore, whose bryny Soil produces
neither Grain, nor Grass. The Trees which are on the same are so dry and weak,
that they may be pusht down with one hand; Neither are there any Birds to be
found here, except Owls; nor Beasts, except Goats and great Hedge-hogs. <i>Pol</i>
sayling from hence, steer’d by the nine Wooddy Isles call’d <i>Roccas</i>, and the three
call’d <i>Aves</i>, to <i>Bonaire</i>, a pretty large rising Isle, which on the North-West hath
a convenient Road, a fresh Water-spring, store of Sheep, on which the <i>Spaniards</i>
live; Pock-wood, and Cotton Trees: Then steering to the Isle <i>Mona</i>, he found
the same to be surrounded with Rocks, and full of Horned Cattel difficult to be
catch’d because of the thick Woods, in which grow exceeding good Oranges. <i>Pol</i>
leaving this Isle, set sayl and steer’d for <i>Flushing</i>, where he safely arriv’d without having
perform’d any remarkable Exploits.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Adrian Pater</i> his Expedition.</div>

<p class='c010'>Mean while the <i>West-India</i> Company fitted out twelve Sayl more, under the
Command of <i>Adrian Johnzon Pater</i>, who set sayl in the middle of <i>August</i>, and Cruised
in vain about the <i>Flemmish</i> Isles for <i>Spanish</i> Ships: About the beginning of the
Year 1629. he sent away three Ships under the Command of <i>Martin Landrode</i>, from
the Island of <i>St. Vincent</i>, whilest he himself ran with the rest of the Fleet into the
Inlet <i>Todos los Sanctos</i>, within a League from the City <i>Salvador</i>, where there lay
onely seven Barques near the Shore, which he judging not worth the while to hazard
his Ships and Men for, steer’d to <i>Pernambuco</i>, took a rich Laden Barque in his
Voyage, and was inform’d by a <i>Brasilian</i> that came aboard of him on floating Pieces
of Timber, that three Sayl of Ships full of Goods were return’d to <i>Reciffa</i>, so
soon as they heard of the <i>Dutch</i> Fleet: But <i>Pater</i> judging no good to be done there,
return’d back to the <i>Caribbee Islands</i>, where near <i>Granada</i> he found three <i>Dutch</i> Vessels,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>which had likewise Cruis’d in vain before the Coast of <i>Brasile</i>. Moreover, the
<i>Pegasus</i>, <i>Raven</i>, and <i>Hart</i> Frigats, parted from the Fleet to Cruise about <i>Monges</i>, touching
at <i>Blanca</i>, they took above a thousand Goats, and between the Cliffs of the
little Isles <i>Monges</i>, abundance of Fish; but descrying no <i>Spanish</i> Ships, they Sail’d to
the Island <i>De Vacca</i>, which hath a brave Harbor, delightful Woods, pleasant Pastures,
fresh-water Brooks, and abundance of wild Horses, Hogs, and Lyons, of
which the Sea-men took an infinite number. Before the low Promontory <i>Corientes</i>,
overgrown with Trees, they got two Prizes laden with <i>Campeche</i> Wood.</p>

<p class='c010'>These three fore-mention’d Frigats, as also the <i>Walcheren</i> and <i>South-star</i> from
<i>Zealand</i>, joyn’d with <i>Pater</i>’s Fleet, when he receiv’d Information, that a considerable
number of <i>Spanish</i> Ships were suddenly expected from <i>Campeche</i>: Whereupon
<i>Paters</i> divided his Fleet into three Squadrons, whereof the Forlorn consisted of
three Sail, the Reserve of the like number, and the Admiral kept five under his
own Command: Thus divided, they stood to and again before <i>Cape Corientes</i>,
when Captain <i>John Stapel</i> brought three, and <i>John van Hoorn</i> four <i>Netherland</i> Ships to
their assistance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Hoorn</i>’s Expedition.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Hoorn</i> having set Sail from the <i>Texel</i> about the latter end of <i>April</i>, was beaten off
from <i>Granada</i> with poyson’d Arrows, and took a Prize before the Promontory
<i>St. Anthony</i>, the Men whereof inform’d him, that the Governor <i>Gabriel de Chaves
Osorio</i>, an old Soldier, had great trouble in repairing the Walls, Forts and Houses in
the City, which two years before had been blown down by a great Storm, and that
six great Ships were lading to go for <i>Carthagena</i> with the Gallions for <i>Spain</i>, because
they durst not Steer by <i>Porto Rico</i> for fear of the <i>Netherlanders</i>; moreover, that abundance
of Ginger was spoyl’d for want of Vessels to carry it away; and that the
Citizens were in great want for Stuffs, none having come in a long time from <i>Spain</i>;
in like manner there went none but Copper Coin, so that nothing was to be got
there. The Silver and Gold Mines were not look’d after, the <i>Spaniards</i> not
caring to work, and the old Natives were long since cut off, insomuch that if the
Imperial Court was not kept in <i>St. Domingo</i>, to which belong’d <i>Cumana</i> and <i>Coro</i>,
that City and Island, and <i>Hispaniola</i> it self, would soon be left desolate. <i>Hoorn</i> therefore
Sail’d by the Promontory <i>St. Cruiz</i>, being a low Point overgrown with Trees,
into the Bay, twenty Leagues from the Mouth whereof lie the Isles <i>Jardin de la
Reyna</i>. Before <i>Corientes</i> he took a Barque with three hundred and six Guns, sent
from <i>Havana</i>, the Men whereof inform’d him, That the Governor of <i>Havana</i>, call’d
<i>Laurence de Cabrera</i>, having Intelligence of the <i>Dutch</i> Fleets approach, rais’d many
Men, and gave notice to the Ships in all the Harbors thereabouts; after which he
took another rich Prize, and joyn’d at last with <i>Paters</i> Fleet, which now consisted
of twenty Sail, with which he Steer’d for the Soundings of <i>Tortugas</i>, where the
Fleet met with a dreadful Tempest, wherein a Thunderbolt splitting the Main-Yard
of the <i>Hunter</i> Frigat, fell down by the Mast, and rowl’d out at one of the
Port-holes, kill’d the Purser, and wounded two more in the Head: great showers
of Rain fell daily, when <i>Samuel Lucas</i> and Captain <i>Outger Minne</i> brought seven
Sail of Ships more to the Fleet, with which <i>Paters</i> put in for fresh Provisions into
the spacious and secure Haven <i>De Cabannas</i>, where several Isles lie, formerly inhabited
by Shepherds and Carpenters.</p>

<p class='c010'>From hence <i>Paters</i> Sail’d by <i>Havana</i>, mended the Port-holes of his lower Deck,
and took off the Top-gallant Masts, because in <i>September</i> the usual Storms begin
here; and seeing that he could not do any Exploit with so great a Fleet, he sent
nine Ships home, and with the rest went to <i>Barbados</i>, where at that time there were
about fifteen hundred <i>English</i> that Planted Tobacco.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span><i>Paters</i> Sailing from hence, ran to the Main Continent of <i>America</i>, inspected the
River <i>Oronoque</i>, where he quenched the Town <i>St. Thomas</i>, that had been set on fire
by the fled Inhabitants, and brought aboard all what they had left.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Henrick Lonque</i>’s Expedition.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Takes <i>Olinda</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>During his fruitless Expedition, the <i>West-India</i> Company Rigg’d out twenty seven
Sail under the Command of <i>Henrick Lonque</i>, <i>Peter Ita</i>, and <i>Joost Bankart</i>; the Land-Soldiers
being Commanded by <i>Diederick Van Waerdenberg</i>. <i>Lonque</i> coming to <i>St. Vincent</i>,
stay’d a long time at Anchor there; for in regard the <i>Spaniard</i> in the <i>Low Countreys</i>
rang’d on the <i>Veluwe</i>, and had taken <i>Amersfoort</i>, the <i>States</i> of the <i>United Netherlands</i>
were forc’d to keep those Men in their Service which the <i>West-India</i> Company
had rais’d; but so soon as <i>Wesel</i> was re-taken, and the <i>Hartogen-Bosch</i> won by <i>Frederick
Henrick</i>, Prince of <i>Orange</i>, thirty six Sail were sent to <i>Lonque</i>’s assistance; of
which some came sooner to him than others at <i>St. Vincent</i>, where he had stay’d four
Moneths without doing any remarkable Exploit. On <i>St. Steven</i>’s Day he set Sail
with fifty two Ships, thirteen Sloops, and two Prizes, all Mann’d with seven
thousand Men, which meeting with contrary Winds and Calms, lay a great while
under the <i>Line</i>, the Scurvey began to encrease amongst them daily, insomuch that
above twelve hundred lay sick, and three hundred dy’d since they set Sail from
<i>St. Vincent</i>; yet at last <i>Lonque</i> getting sight of <i>Olinda</i>, sent <i>Waerdenberg</i> on the fourth
of <i>February</i> with sixteen Ships, carrying three thousand Men to <i>Pavo Morello</i>, a Wood,
lying two Leagues Northward from <i>Olinda</i>, where he suddenly Landed, notwithstanding
the <i>Portuguese</i> guarded the Shore with two thousand Men, whom <i>Waerdenberg</i>,
after a short Skirmish, putting to flight, was the whole Night in Arms,
and the next day became Master of <i>Olinda</i>, by breaking in on the North at the same
time, when Colonel <i>Schutte</i> Storm’d on the South. Moreover, the Enemy surrendred
the two Forts on <i>Reciffa</i>, and forsook the Island.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the middle of <i>March</i> nine Ships which were wanting to make up <i>Lonque</i>’s
Fleet, came to an Anchor by him, having brought him above six hundred Soldiers,
many Guns, all manner of Ammunition under the Command of Lieutenant Colonel
<i>Alexander Seton</i>, and the three Adjutants <i>John de Bruine</i>, <i>Philip Serooskerken</i>, and
<i>Horatius Calandryn</i>, who immediately order’d the Cloyster on <i>Antonio Vaes</i> to be fortifi’d,
and built a Fort with four Bulwarks at the Entrance of <i>Pozo</i> in the Countrey
<i>Reciffa</i>. <i>Seton</i> also set fire on the Suburbs of <i>Olinda</i>, in which the Enemy had Lodg’d
the Night before, and endeavor’d to poyson the fresh Water on <i>Antonio Vaes</i>, when
on a sudden the <i>Netherlanders</i> fell upon them; two which drank of the Water dy’d,
and others fell into great Fits of Sicknesses, and it wanted little but that the Admiral
<i>Lonque</i>, with a Company of fifty Musquetteers, had been kill’d returning
from <i>Reciffa</i> to <i>Olinda</i>, he being unawares set upon by two Companies of <i>Portugueses</i>
and <i>Brasilians</i>, who kill’d above thirty six of his Men, and dangerously wounded
six more, so that he brought off but eight Men unhurt. The like Misfortune befell
the Wood-cutters on <i>Antonio Vaes</i>, surpris’d by the <i>Portuguese</i> from an Ambuscade.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whilest Affairs stood thus about <i>Olinda</i>, there first arriv’d two Ships from the
<i>United Netherlands</i> at <i>Reciffa</i>, not long after four more, Commanded by <i>John Walbeek</i>,
and eight more under the Admiral <i>Dirik Van Uitgeest</i>, who was follow’d by the
<i>Noahs Ark</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the same time <i>Dirk de Ruiter</i> set Sail with six Ships, and <i>Peter Ita</i> with ten,
to Cruise at Sea.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Ita</i> being set upon by the Enemy, escapes very narrowly.</div>

<p class='c010'>About the beginning of <i>February</i>, <i>Lonque</i> having put all things in good order, prepar’d
to return home, and weigh’d Anchor with nine Ships. But <i>Ita</i> going from
<i>Reciffa</i> to <i>Olinda</i>, to take his leave of the Council there, was suddenly surpris’d after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>a strange manner; he had ninety Musquetteers for his Guard, whose Matches
were all put out, and their Arms all wet by a great shower of Rain, which they
perceiving from their Ambuscades, immediately got cross the River, and kill’d
thirty of the <i>Netherlanders</i>, the rest running away, left <i>Ita</i> to defend himself, which
he did for some time with his Sword, but had absolutely been slain, had he not receiv’d
Aid from <i>Olinda</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Because the <i>Portuguese</i> made several Attempts upon the <i>Netherlanders</i>, not without
damage on both sides, the <i>West-India</i> Company often sent Ships to their assistance;
and likewise many <i>Brasilians</i> deserting the <i>Portuguese</i>, joyn’d with the <i>Netherlanders</i>,
who built a five-corner’d Fort with Bulwarks about the Cloyster on <i>Antonio
Vaes</i>; which to prevent, the <i>Portuguese</i> ventur’d many a Sally, though not without
considerable loss on their part. They also reported, that <i>Frederick de Toledo</i> was
making thither with a great Fleet, to drive the <i>Netherlanders</i> out of <i>Brasile</i>; at which
they taking the Alarm, put themselves all into a posture of Defence, rais’d new
Works about the Castle on <i>Reciffa</i>, whilest the Ships which Cruis’d on that Coast
brought in several Prizes.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>John Walbeek</i> being chosen General by the <i>West-India</i> Company over <i>Brasile</i>, had a
Design on the Promontory <i>St. Augustine</i>; but it came to no effect, because the Sea
beat so vehemently against the Shore.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Great Supplies sent to <i>Brasile</i> by the <i>Netherland West-India</i> Company.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Report of the great preparation of a Fleet which was making ready in
<i>Spain</i>, mov’d the <i>West-India</i> Company to raise more Men, and to send out Admiral
<i>Paters</i> with seventeen Ships, which all arriv’d safe, except the <i>Black Lyon</i> Frigat,
which carrying the Lieutenant-Colonel <i>Eltz</i> and Captain <i>Uitgeest</i>, was never
heard of.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Joost Bankart</i> was also sent out in <i>March</i> with eight Ships to <i>St. Helena</i>, to Cruise
there for the rich <i>Carraks</i> which us’d to Water there; but though he stay’d till <i>August</i>
before this fruitful Island, yet saw not one Ship at Sea, nor a Man on the Island,
but great numbers of Sea-pies, which are so tame, that they suffer themselves to be
taken up with the Hand, or knock’d on the Head with Sticks.</p>

<p class='c010'>Near this Isle <i>Ita</i> took a Ketch Prize, and rallying his whole Fleet together, Steer’d
for the <i>Caimans</i>; the most Eastern Isle whereof being about three Leagues long, is
full of Rocks, with a high Point on the East; the other part thereof is plain. Then
dividing his Fleet into seven Squadrons, he made them all ready for an Engagement,
when he was inform’d by an <i>English</i>-man before <i>Corientes</i>, that <i>Frederick de Toledo</i>
had set Sail with eighty Ships from <i>Havana</i> to <i>Spain</i>, of which he had sent back
eight Gallions to <i>Carthagena</i>: Hereupon bending his Course near <i>Havana</i>, he put the
whole Countrey to an Alarm, burnt a rich laden Vessel, and another that carry’d a
Flag on the Fore-top, and a third laden with Ballast.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Joachim Guysen</i> being made Commander of the <i>Dolphin</i> Frigat, and sent to joyn
with Admiral <i>Pater</i>’s Squadron, was driven below <i>Jamaica</i>, and at last strook against
the great <i>Caiman</i>, where his Vessel was all shatter’d to pieces; but all his Men and
Goods being sav’d, he spent sixteen Weeks in making a Ketch of the pieces of the
<i>Dolphin</i>, and brought a hundred and twenty Men, four Brass, and two Iron Guns to
the Fleet, having buried the rest on <i>Caiman</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Five Leagues beyond <i>Havana</i>, a <i>Spanish</i> Ship laden with <i>Campeche</i> Wood and <i>Sarsaparilla</i>,
being chased against the Shore, was set on fire by her own Men, which the
<i>Hollanders</i> attempted twice in vain to put out.</p>

<p class='c010'>After this <i>Ita</i>’s Fleet lay long upon the Coast of <i>Cuba</i>, but finding no <i>Spanish</i> Vessels,
and their Provisions growing scarce, return’d back to the <i>Texel</i>, where they
arriv’d without doing any farther Exploits.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>St. Martha</i> taken by the <i>Dutch</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>In the mean while <i>Pater</i> lying before <i>Punta del Gallo</i>, intending to Invade the
City built on the Shore of the Island <i>Trinidad</i>; but the Fort built at the Mouth of
the River, and contrary Current preventing his Design, he ran through the middlemost
Hole of <i>Boccas</i> to <i>Blanca</i>, where he caught two thousand Goats and a <i>Bonaire</i>,
set several Towns on fire, whilest the <i>Spaniards</i> made a Smother of dry Stubble
all along the Fields, through which the <i>Hollanders</i> were to return, that so they
might be choak’d with the Smoak; which their Invention had prov’d successful,
had not the <i>Hollanders</i> forc’d a Way through a Wood. At last the Fleet leaving <i>Hispaniola</i>,
Steer’d for <i>St. Martha</i>, a Town built on the Main Coast between <i>Carthagena</i>,
and the River <i>La Hacha</i>, being instigated thereto by a Letter (taken by the
<i>Hollanders</i> in a Prize) writ by the Governor <i>Hieronymo de Quero</i> to the <i>Spanish</i> King;
which Letter set forth the present Condition of <i>St. Martha</i>, whereby they conceiv’d
great hopes of a possibility of taking it, and of the Advantages that would accrue
thereby: nor did it happen contrary to their expectation; for the Admiral Landing
his Men, took the City without the least resistance; and though the great Fort fir’d
some Guns, yet it soon surrendred on promise of Quarter; the City also was sav’d
from being burn’d, by paying fifty five hundred Pieces of Eight, after they had
plunder’d the same, and carry’d away whatsoe’re they thought good. Mean while
the Provisions growing scarce in the Fleet, <i>Pater</i> judg’d it convenient to return
home, where he arriv’d safely with all his Prizes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The valiant Exploit of <i>John Lichthart</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Notable Exploits were perform’d by <i>John Lichthart</i>, one of which, amongst others
ought not to be omitted, <i>viz.</i> he setting Sail homewards from <i>Reciffa</i> about the
beginning of <i>October</i> <i>Anno 1630.</i> chanc’d to fall with his Ship, the <i>Over-yzel</i>, amongst
five <i>Biscayan</i> Pyrats, Cruising between the <i>French</i> and <i>English</i> Coast, which thought
to clap him aboard on a sudden; but they seeing him bear up to them, were afraid
to venture, and Tack’d about: after which he was set upon about three Leagues
to the Northward of the <i>Lizard</i>, by three Frigats belonging to <i>Dunkirk</i>, the biggest
whereof carry’d thirty six Guns, the second twenty eight, and the last twelve; with
which three he maintain’d a Fight eight hours, in which he had fourteen Men kill’d,
and thirty two wounded; his Ship resembled a Wreck, the Main-mast being shot
overboard, the Rudder hung by pieces at the Stern, and the Tackling all shatter’d
and torn, besides seven Shot under Water, and not less than four hundred through
the sides above, but not without sufficient marks of retribution on the <i>Dunkirkers</i>
side; but <i>Lichthart</i> getting into <i>Plymouth</i>, mended his Ship, and from thence Sail’d
to <i>Amsterdam</i>, where he was Presented with a Gold Chain in recompence of his
Valor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Expedition of the <i>Brown-Fish</i> Frigat.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Expedition of the <i>Brown-Fish</i> Frigat is also remarkable, which Sailing beyond
<i>Cape de Verd</i>, Steer’d by <i>Cape Roxo</i> along the Shore to the River <i>Catchieu</i>, at
whose Mouth lie two Shelves, and between them ran a Channel through which the
Ships pass’d. The <i>Brown-Fish</i> Sailing about a League up the River, which is a Mile
in breadth, took a <i>Portuguese</i> Barque. The Seamen also Landing on the Isle <i>Bissis</i>,
spake <i>Portuguese</i> with the Natives, who are Coal-black, and have strong Bodies, go
Arm’d with Darts, Bowes, Arrows, Symiters, and were Baptiz’d by a Priest sent
thither from <i>Portugal</i>, who with a few Countrey-men had built a Chappel and
some Houses there.</p>

<p class='c010'>From hence the <i>Brown-Fish</i> Sail’d to the most Northern Isle <i>Bisegos</i>, which is continually
at Wars with <i>Bissis</i>. The King of this Isle receiving some Presents from
the <i>Netherlanders</i>, gave leave to his Subjects, shie at first, to go aboard of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Steering from hence to <i>Noronho</i>, they found the Inhabitants carry’d away, and
their Gardens and Houses ruin’d, so that they could get nothing but wild Pumpions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>to refresh themselves with; therefore leaving the Isle they anchor’d at
<i>Reciffa</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the interim, whilest these Expeditions were carry’d on as hath been related,
Captain <i>John Boon-eter</i> (who parted from the Admiral <i>Ita</i>’s Fleet with eight Sail of
Ships) Cruis’d to and again before <i>Hispaniola</i> till <i>May</i> Anno 1631. near <i>Mona</i> he
took a rich Vessel coming from <i>Porto Rico</i>, another before the Island <i>Vacca</i>, and a
third full of Ginger, with which he Steer’d to the <i>Tortugas</i>, being seven in number,
resembling rather sandy Flats than Isles. Before <i>Havana</i> he also chased several Vessels,
but lost sight of them in the Night. Mean while their Provisions growing
short, the Seamen were desirous to return; which <i>Boon-eter</i> would no way yield to,
because the time began to approach in which the <i>Spanish</i> Ships came from all places
to <i>Havana</i>; but the Men mutinying forc’d him to Steer to the <i>Texel</i>, where they arriv’d
without doing any considerable Exploit advantageous to the <i>West-India</i>
Company.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fort of <i>Tamarica</i> assault’d by the <i>Dutch</i> in vain.</div>

<p class='c010'>But at the same time fourteen Ships, three Sloops, and seven great Pinnaces,
weighed Anchor from <i>Reciffa</i> with a thousand two hundred and sixty Men, divided
into twelve Companies, under the Command of <i>Hartman Godefrid</i> and <i>Stein Callenfels</i>;
who Landing on the Island <i>Tamarica</i>, march’d along a bad and narrow Path,
partly craggy and partly sandy, to a Fort built on a high Ascent overgrown with
Brambles in such a manner, that it was impossible for them to break through,
whilest they in the Fort fir’d continually upon <i>Stein Callenfels</i>, who judg’d it convenient
to draw off, and Storm the Castle on another side.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Admiral <i>Pater</i> newly come from the <i>Texel</i> to <i>Olinda</i>, sent three Ketches, a
Sloop, and two Pinnaces, beyond the Town <i>Tamarica</i>, to prevent the Enemies crossing
over to the Main, and keep off their Fire-ships. They also receiv’d Information
from three <i>Portuguese</i> and five <i>Brasilian</i> Prisoners, That the Castle, surrounded
with Fens and Brambles, had sixteen Guns; and that <i>Albuquerque</i> had sent eight
hundred Men to assist the three hundred that lay in Garrison there before. The
Captains <i>Le Grand</i> and <i>Arcisseusky</i> found two other Ways that led to the Fort, but altogether
unfit to march along with their Men and Guns. <i>Pater</i> also Row’d round
the Island with Sloops, and fathom’d the Water, whilest <i>Arcisseusky</i> Sailing up the
River to <i>Garasi</i>, suppos’d that he had found a much better place to make an Onset
on the Castle in, than had been found out yet; but the Council of <i>Olinda</i> and <i>Stein
Callenfels</i> look’d upon it as too great a hazard to Storm a Fort, to which the Ways
lay so much to the Enemy’s advantage, a small number in the same being able to
beat off a considerable Party; therefore it was judg’d best, and concluded upon, to
build a Fort on a little Isle near <i>Tamarica</i>, at the Mouth of the River; to which
purpose the Engineer <i>Buuren</i> contriv’d a square Castle with a long Horn-work,
which was call’d <i>Orange</i>; in which the Captains <i>Arcisseusky</i>, <i>Mellingen</i>, and <i>Beyer</i>,
were left in Garrison with their Companies, whilest the rest of the Regiment return’d
to <i>Reciffa</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mean while <i>Antonio de Oquendo</i> brought a great Fleet to <i>St. Salvador</i>; and <i>Callenfels</i>
drew four Companies of Musquetteers, and a great company of Seamen with Pick-axes
and Spades out of the Fort <i>Frederick Henrick</i> into the Field, and marching Southward
along private Ways, he found the River strongly fortifi’d near the Forts <i>Affogados</i>,
having above and below a row of strong Pallisado’s; yet the <i>Portuguese</i> that
guarded these Works after a small resistance fled, and left all: But because a general
Alarm drew many People in Arms out of <i>Real</i>, and several other places, <i>Callenfels</i>
drew off in good order, and was inform’d by a Prisoner call’d <i>Peter Alves</i>, that the
Fort <i>Affogados</i> receiv’d that Denomination from the River on which it was built;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>that there lay generally a hundred and fifty Men in Garrison there; that about
a Mile farther was the Fort <i>Pirange</i>. that <i>Peter de Acunha</i> bore the chief Command
next to <i>Albuquerque</i> over the <i>Militia</i>, who us’d few Musquets but what had Fire-locks;
and that they wanted no Ammunition, for six great Carvels loaden with the same
had not long since stor’d them with great plenty thereof. The <i>Netherlanders</i> also
understanding by Letters which they had taken, that the <i>Tapuyans</i> were very much
incens’d against the <i>Portuguese</i>, who stood in great fear of these salvage People, it
was judg’d convenient by the Council at <i>Olinda</i>, to invite the <i>Tapuyans</i> to be their
Friends.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fight between the <i>Dutch</i> and <i>Spanish</i> Fleet.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Admiral <i>Pater</i> drown’d.</div>

<p class='c010'>On the eleventh of <i>September</i> Anno 1631. Admiral <i>Pater</i> and Vice-Admiral <i>Martin
Thyszoon</i>, whose joint Forces were fifteen Men of War and three Ketches, carrying
nine Companies of Foot, Commanded by Captain <i>Engelbert Schutte</i>, descrying
the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet about an hour before Sun-set, animated all the Officers and Captains
to regard their Honor and Oath which they had taken; telling them, That
on this Engagement would depend the Welfare or Ruine of the <i>West-India</i> Company.
But his Men were not so much heartned by his Speech, as daunted at the
sight of the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet, which consisted of twelve <i>Castilian</i> and five <i>Portuguese</i> Gallions,
and twenty six other Vessels, as Pinks, Fly-boats and Carvels, all well
Mann’d and full of Guns, the Gallions carrying whole and Demi-Cannons; the
Admiral, call’d <i>Antonio de Oquendo</i>, carrying forty eight great Guns in his Gallion,
call’d <i>St. Jago</i>; whereas they had receiv’d Information but of four Gallions and
eighteen lesser Vessels; nevertheless <i>Pater</i> no whit discourag’d, boarded him about
ten a Clock the next Morning, whilest Captain <i>John Mast</i> boarded him on the other
side, which occasion’d a bloody Engagement; and it would have prov’d fatal to
the <i>Spaniard</i>, had not <i>Pater</i>’s Stern taken fire, which he endeavoring in vain to put
out, and none coming to his assistance, after he had hung a good while by a Rope at
the <i>Spanish</i> Admiral’s Bowe, he was forc’d through faintness to let go and fall into
the Water, whilest his Ship was blown up, a few of his Men onely being sav’d by
<i>Oquendo</i>. In the mean time <i>Martin Thyszoon</i> boarded the Gallion <i>Antonio de Padua</i>,
Commanded by the Vice-Admiral <i>Francisco de Vallezilla</i> on one side, and the <i>Utrecht</i>
Frigat on the other, which after half an hours Engagement lost her Main-mast, and
after a sharp Fight of four hours the Fire took hold of her Sails; which the <i>Netherlanders</i>
not being able to quench, leap’d desperately over into the <i>Spanish</i> Vice-Admiral;
but he having two hundred and sixty Men aboard, beat them off, forcing
them to leap into the Water, or sell their Lives at a dear rate. But Captain <i>Thyszoon</i>
had better success, for he not onely sunk the Vice-Admiral, but took the <i>Bonaventura</i>
Gallion, and likewise gave the Gallion <i>John Baptista</i> so many shot under Water,
that she sunk likewise. The Night approaching ended this bloody Engagement;
and the <i>Netherlanders</i> Fleet much damnifi’d stood Northwards, with intention
to return to <i>Reciffa</i>. The next Morning <i>Oquendo</i> had lost sight of them, but descry’d
them again on the fifteenth of <i>September</i>, and kept in view of them the six following
days, five Leagues from him to the East, or East South-East, <i>Martin Thyszoon</i>
coming to an Anchor before <i>Reciffa</i> on the twenty second of <i>September</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the same time the <i>Amsterdam</i> Frigat set Sail from thence for <i>St. Salvador</i>,
with intention to joyn with <i>Pater</i>’s Fleet there, but not finding the Admiral, return’d,
and near <i>Cape St. Augustine</i> discover’d the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet; wherefore running
close behind them she receiv’d four Guns from <i>Oquendo</i>, which she answer’d, and
kept at a distance from them the whole Night, in hopes to meet with one single
Vessel or other belonging to the Fleet; but the <i>Spanish</i> Vice-Admiral bearing little
Sail, guarded the Rere, and fir’d continually at the <i>Amsterdam</i> Frigat, who fearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_537'>537</span>an unlucky Bullet, made all the Sail she could possible, and brought news of
the approach of the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet to <i>Reciffa</i>. Soon after which the <i>Elephant</i> came
from the <i>Dutch</i> Fleet thither, with a full Account of the fore-mention’d Engagement,
<i>viz.</i> That besides the Admiral <i>Pater</i>, there were slain Captain <i>Thomas Sickes</i>,
<i>Cormillion</i>, and Lieutenant <i>Steenbergen</i>, also that two Ships, the <i>Prince William</i> and the
<i>Province of Utrecht</i>, were sunk: In lieu of which they had taken the Gallion call’d
<i>The Bonaventura</i>, with twenty six Brass Guns, weighing above sixty four thousand
Pound, two hundred and forty <i>Castilians</i>, and a great parcel of Sugar and Tobacco;
Amongst the Prisoners was one call’d <i>Francisco de Fuentes</i>, who being Examin’d,
gave this Information, <i>viz.</i> That the Fleet carry’d two Regiments of <i>Spaniards</i> and
one of <i>Italians</i>; in which three Regiments were four thousand Men, under the
Command of <i>Conde del Bangniola</i>; and that upon the setting out of <i>Ferdinand</i>, the
King’s Brother, to the <i>Netherlands</i>, all the chiefest Gallions and <i>Dunkirk</i> Ships were
sent for, and <i>English</i> Vessels hir’d, to convey him safe to the <i>Flemmish</i> Coast, which
made <i>Oquenda</i> set Sail with so much the lesser number to <i>St. Salvador</i>; that the
sunk Gallion, call’d <i>Antonio de Padua</i>, had fourteen Brass Guns in her Hold, besides
twenty six that were mounted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Two <i>Tapuyan</i> Kings offer their Service to the <i>Hollanders</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Soon after a <i>Brasilian</i> that had pass’d by <i>Albuquerque</i>’s Army to <i>Olinda</i>, brought Information,
That he was sent by <i>Jandui</i> and <i>Oquenou</i>, two Kings belonging to the <i>Tapuyans</i>,
to enquire if the <i>Topatingas</i> (for so they call’d the <i>Netherlanders</i> that belong’d
to the <i>West-India</i> Company) did yet reside in <i>Pernambuco</i>, with Proffers to assist them
with their Forces. Moreover, he inform’d them, That since his departure from
<i>Boudewyn Henrickszoon</i>, a great many of the <i>Tapuyans Petivares</i> were kill’d by the <i>Portuguese</i>
near the River <i>Grande</i> and Inlet <i>Trajiciaon</i>, because they had assisted <i>Henrickszoon</i>,
who had left them helpless at his departure. He added also, That if the <i>West-India</i>
Company would give the other <i>Brasilians</i> any assurance to assist the <i>Tapuyans</i>,
it would be necessary to Consult about it near the River <i>Grande</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Proposal was found to be of so weighty a Concern, that <i>Ellert Smient</i> being
sent with the Ship call’d <i>The New Netherland</i>, and a great Sloop, to <i>Siara</i>, to make
farther enquiry into the Business, was accompanied by a Renegado <i>Portuguese</i>
call’d <i>Samuel Cochin</i>, and several <i>Brasilians</i> (whom <i>Henrickszoon</i> upon their Request
carry’d with him from the Inlet <i>Trajiciaon</i> to <i>Holland</i>) who went, under pretence
of visiting their Relations at the River <i>Grande</i> and <i>Siara</i>, to invite their Countrey-men
to joyn with the <i>Netherlanders</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Olinda</i> deserted and demolish’d by the <i>Hollanders</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>During <i>Smient</i>’s absence many Consultations were held about the demolishing
or defending of the City <i>Olinda</i>, about which there had formerly been many Contests;
but at last the Voices carry’d it, which were for the demolishing thereof, in
regard it was of little Consequence; and could not be kept without many Men and
great Charges, because of its bad Situation, whenas their Men might do greater
Service in other places: Wherefore they began to carry all things necessary from
<i>Olinda</i> to <i>Reciffa</i>, and on the twenty fourth of <i>November</i> the City was set on fire with
Barrels of Pitch and Tar, being in a light flame at every corner, whilest <i>Stein Callenfels</i>
drew off the Garrison in good order to <i>Reciffa</i>; and immediately sixteen hundred
Men under his Command were put aboard of sixteen Vessels, with intention
to go to <i>Parayba</i>; but the Enemy having a fortnight before had notice of this Design,
had fortifi’d himself all along the River. <i>Callenfels</i> approaching, espy’d twelve
<i>Portuguese</i> Standards, and the Men ready on the Breast-works to prevent his Landing;
yet nevertheless he not regarding their Bullets, press’d in amongst them, and
forc’d the Enemy from his Works.</p>

<p class='c010'>Near the Water stood a Stone Castle, and on one side of it a large Store-house;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>on the Mountain near the City appear’d the <i>Franciscan</i> Cloyster; the Fort rais’d of
Earth had four Bulwarks, and twenty six Guns, according to the Information of
the Eye-witnesses <i>Drevis</i> and <i>Berster</i>, who were sent thither as Spies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Callenfels</i> attempts to take the City, but without success.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Callenfels</i> Landed not so carefully but that he lost forty Men, either kill’d from
behind the Breastworks, or out of a neighboring Wood. Being inform’d by a <i>Portuguese</i>
Prisoner, of the ill Condition of the Town, and how slenderly it was provided,
he immediately rais’d a Sconce, two Watch-houses, and a Pallisado, from
which he fir’d with two Guns on the Castle, and made several Trenches; but the
Besieged were stronger in People and Guns than the Besiegers, who being scarce
able, by reason of their small number, to keep Guards in all places, were also tir’d
out under a hot Climate, and fainted for want of Provisions, insomuch that in
two days there dy’d and fell sick above two hundred; wherefore <i>Callenfels</i> judg’d it
best to draw off in time; which that they might do securely, they made a Redoubt,
and the six Companies Commanded by the Captains <i>Redincheven</i>, <i>Meppelen</i>, <i>Cloppenburg</i>,
<i>Schenk</i>, <i>Byma</i>, and <i>Cook</i>, resolv’d upon a desperate Attempt, as followeth:
Marching privately through a Wood behind the Enemy’s Works, they fell in at
one side upon the <i>Portuguese</i> Trenches, from whence they drove them after a small
resistance, and forc’d them to flie towards the Fort, whither they were pursu’d with
such eagerness, that those who were in the Fort, lest the <i>Hollanders</i> might get in with
them, lock’d up the Avenues against their own Men; at which they were so amaz’d,
that some of them climb’d up by the Walls of the Fort, but were either kill’d by the
Assailants, or knock’d on the Head by their own People, because several <i>Hollanders</i>
went to climb up amongst the <i>Portuguese</i>; the rest running about the Fort, fell into
the midst of the <i>Netherlanders</i>, where they were all cut off, being in number above a
hundred. The <i>Hollanders</i> also in this resolute Design, had about twenty Men kill’d,
and fifty wounded; after which they put lighted Matches on Sticks in their Enemy’s
Works, as if they had never made any Attempt on the City <i>Parayba</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whilest this Expedition fell out so unfortunately, <i>Smient</i> performing his Voyage,
found in the Inlet <i>Trajiciaon</i> a <i>Portuguese</i> Vessel hal’d near the Shore under the
protection of two Pallisado’s; wherefore supposing it best not to make any Attempt
on the same, he ran to an Anchor before <i>Ubranduba</i>, twenty Leagues below the River
<i>Grande</i>; where the Natives <i>Marcial</i>, <i>Tacou</i>, <i>Ararova</i>, and <i>Matauwe</i>, who had been
in <i>Holland</i>, Landing, went to see, and speak with their Countrey-men to joyn with
the <i>Netherland West-India</i> Company: and some days after the Seamen Landing again
in the same place, met with <i>Tacou</i>, together with eight more stout Men, and seventeen
Women and Children, who carry’d a slain <i>Portuguese</i> call’d <i>Juan Perera</i>, to the
River <i>Grande</i>, about whom they had found Letters containing the whole Condition
of <i>Siara</i>; which the <i>Brasilians</i> imparting to <i>Smient</i>, he sent a Ketch thither before, and
follow’d after himself; they Steer’d along the Shore beyond the Shelves <i>Guamare</i>, by
the Mountains <i>Sailinas</i> and <i>Porto de Mel</i>, the Haven <i>De Onces</i>, and River <i>Juaguarive</i>, to
the <i>White Point</i>, where the <i>Brasilians</i> Landing spake with their People, and towards
the Evening brought good tydings, and desir’d that they might be Landed at <i>Siara</i>,
where they would put their Design in practice: <i>Smient</i> following their Advice,
receiv’d them aboard the <i>New Netherland</i>, and Sail’d along by the square Fort <i>Siara</i>
towards a smooth Shore on each side, hedg’d in by thick Woods, where the <i>Brasilians</i>
intended to Land; but the <i>Portuguese</i>, and <i>Brasilians</i> belonging to their Party,
being gotten into the Wood before, fir’d so vehemently, that they were forc’d to
Retreat, and Sail five Leagues farther beyond the Cape <i>Opese</i>, made dangerous by
the many blind Cliffs that lie about the same. <i>Smient</i> anchoring here, Landed the
<i>Brasilians</i>, on promise that they would return in two days; but the Seamen seeing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>sometimes ten, sometimes fifteen Arm’d <i>Portugueses</i> ashore, judg’d that the <i>Brasilians</i>
had been slain by them, and therefore weighed Anchor to the great dislike of
the <i>West-India</i> Company.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since this unsuccessful Design on <i>Parayba</i>, the Council at <i>Reciffa</i> were no whit
discourag’d, but resolv’d to make an Attempt on the River <i>Grande</i> with twelve
Ships and two Sloops, carrying ten Companies of Soldiers, besides Seamen; but by
reason of the difficulty of Landing (because the Coast being very Rocky, makes
the Sea go very hollow), the strength of the Place, both in respect of its Fortification
and number of Defendants, and the joyning of the <i>Brasilians</i> with them, they
were forc’d to return without effecting their Design.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Expedition of <i>Nekker</i>, <i>Houte-been</i>, and others.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Marquess <i>Salinas</i> murther’d for his Jewels.</div>

<p class='c010'>About the same time eight Sail arriv’d at <i>Reciffa</i> from <i>Holland</i>, and <i>Jonathan de
Nekker</i>, <i>Cornelis Corneliszoon</i>, alias <i>Houte-been</i>, and <i>Reinier Peterszoon</i>, set out with three
Frigats from the <i>Texel</i> to the Isle <i>Vacca</i>, where with Hunting, Fishing, and gathering
of Fruit, they refresh’d themselves, and afterwards Steer’d to the River <i>Magdalena</i>,
discernable at three Leagues distance by the thick yellow Water it discharges
into the Sea through three Mouths. Between the Western and middlemost Mouth
lies an Isle in the middle of the River, behind which <i>Houte-been</i> came to an Anchor,
whilest <i>Nekker</i> and <i>Peterszoon</i> kept Guard near <i>Punto Verde</i>; where though the Wind
blew very fresh in the Night, yet the Water remain’d smooth: About Day-break
<i>Nekker</i> discovering a Sail, made chase after the same, but not able to come up with
her, lost her the following Night, and in the Morning saw a Barque, which running
ashore was set on fire by <i>Peterszoon</i>;  after which <i>Nekker</i> chased two other
Ships, which likewise getting from him, he stood off at Sea out of sight of the Isles
<i>Zamba</i>, which are low on the West, and Hilly at the East-end, where the Sea beats
vehemently against a Promontory, and chased a Barque ashore, whither he sent a
Boat with eight Men; which being beaten to pieces by the Waves, drowned four
of them, and the rest getting ashore were kill’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>. Soon after
which four <i>Spanish</i> Ships set Sail after <i>Nekker</i> and <i>Peterszoon</i>, and had not the Night
favor’d them they had been but in a bad Condition; for they were not able to get
their Sea-men aboard, who having taken some Wine ashore, had made themselves
Drunk; about Day-break they descry’d the four <i>Spanish</i> Vessels, which were gotten
so far from them, that they could but just discern them from the Main-top. Not long
after they took two Barques, and came to an Anchor behind <i>Zamba</i> by <i>Houte-been</i>,
who being driven by a Storm out of the River <i>Magdalena</i> to <i>Jamaica</i>, had chased
a Barque ashore there, and a Ship with four hundred <i>Negro</i>’s against <i>St. Martha</i>, and
since took a rich laden Barque near the River <i>Magdalena</i>. In like manner <i>Nekker</i> and
<i>Peterszoon</i> took a Ship coming from <i>Caraques</i>, leaving <i>Houte-been</i> alone before <i>Magdalena</i>,
who not long after discover’d eighteen <i>Spanish</i> Ships near the High-land
<i>St. Martha</i>, which were Steering to <i>Carthagena</i>; one whereof belonging to <i>Carthagena</i>
he made Prize of, but was forc’d to forsake her in a great Storm; after the ceasing
of which he took another Frigat, the Men whereof inform’d him, That the Admiral
<i>Thomas de Caspure</i> was going with eleven Ships from <i>Cape Antonio</i> to <i>Porto Belo</i>, to
lade the <i>Peruvian</i> Silver there. The Ship with <i>Angolan Negro</i>’s, taken by <i>Houte-been</i>,
he set free, but kept a Frigat laden with Tallow, Hides, Tobacco, and Flesh, which
he had taken just before the Coast of <i>Rio Grande</i>;  and thus he went Privateering up
and down, when the Plate-Fleet from <i>New Spain</i> weighed Anchor from <i>Juan de Lua</i>,
the like of which in Riches had never set Sail before, for it carry’d 2169340 <i>Ryals</i>
of <i>Eight</i> for the Merchants, an unvaluable Treasure for the King, besides many
rich Commodities which several bought upon their own Accounts, that were
not entred in the Custom-house: all which Treasure, laden in nine Gallions, besides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span>a considerable number of Frigats and small Vessels, was committed to the
Charge of <i>Miguel de Echacareta</i>; but he dying before the Fleet set Sail, <i>Manuel Serano
de Ribera</i> was chosen Admiral; but a dreadful Storm arising as they were Sailing before
the Coast of <i>Campeche</i> in their Way to <i>Havana</i>, the whole Fleet was in a manner
utterly destroy’d, with a most unvaluable Treasure: The Admiral, Vice-Admiral,
Gallion <i>Teresia</i>, and several other Gallions, sunk, with at least two thousand Men, a
great number of Persons of Quality, and amongst the rest the Marquess <i>Salinas</i>, who
was most treacherously slain by thirty Persons, who made themselves Masters of a
Sloop, into which he went for safety out of the sinking Admiral <i>Juseppe</i>: That
which instigated them to this horrid Act, was the sight of a small Trunk of Jewels
which he carry’d into the Sloop: Not long after falling out amongst themselves
about dividing the Spoil, several of them were discover’d, apprehended, and put to
death.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Fleet weighed Anchor the day after their Admiral <i>Miguel de Echacareta</i> was
buried, who dy’d so suddenly that he could make no Will. A few days after the
departure of the Fleet, a hundred and seventy Houses were burnt at <i>Juan de Lua</i>. It
appears that the <i>Spaniards</i> out of fear of the <i>Netherlanders</i>, set Sail on the tenth of
<i>October</i>, notwithstanding it was at an inconvenient time, because about that Season
the Hurricanes rage most terribly in the Bay of <i>Vera Crux</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>By a Letter from the Treasurer <i>Franciscus Suarez</i> it appears, that the two Regiments
in the City <i>St. Salvador</i>, the one Commanded by <i>Christopher Mexia Bocanegra</i>,
consisting of nine Companies, each of sixty Men, and the other Commanded by
<i>Vasco de Mascarennas</i>, consisting of thirteen Companies, cost the King of <i>Spain</i> yearly
21515 <i>l.</i> to maintain them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Walbeck</i>’s Exploits.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Netherland</i> Council at <i>Reciffa</i> no way discourag’d by their successless
Attempts made the last Year on <i>Rio Grande</i>, sent thirteen Companies of Soldiers
aboard of seventeen Vessels, to build a Fort at the River <i>Formosa</i>,  where the <i>Portuguese</i>
being too weak to resist them, set fire on a Store-house with three hundred
Chests of Sugar, and fled: <i>Walbeck</i> was Commander in Chief in this Design, who
Landing on <i>Formosa</i> found no fit place to build a Fort in, because the Shore, not
being above a Musquet-shot broad, was inclos’d with Woods, behind which lay
high Mountains that Commanded the Shore; therefore marching to <i>Serinhain</i> he
burnt several Houses and a new Sugar-Mill, near which in a Store-house he took
twelve hundred Chests of Sugar, which for want of Carts he could not carry to his
Ships. Also before <i>Porto Calvo</i> he burnt a Carvel, and took a great number of Cattel
on <i>Camarigibi</i>, and return’d without any farther Exploits to <i>Reciffa</i>, where the
Cruisers had brought in several Prizes during his absence.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Council resolving not to sit idle, set out another Fleet of eighteen Ships
under the Command of <i>Martin Thyszoon</i>, with a Regiment of fourteen Companies
under <i>Stein Callenfels</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Expedition of <i>Martin Thyszoon</i> and <i>Stein Callenfels</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Fleet approaching <i>Cape Augustin</i>, they found a ridge of Rocks along the
Shore, against which the Sea beat with great vehemency; at length they came before
a small Inlet, at whose Mouth lay a small Fort from which the Enemy fir’d upon
the Mann’d Boats which Row’d by the same: at some distance they discern’d
two Breastworks, one rais’d above the other near the Shore; on which when the
<i>Hollanders</i> thought to Land, three hundred <i>Portugueses</i> fir’d at once upon them;
and on a Hill not far from thence appear’d more Men, which amaz’d the Council
of War, for the Inlet was so narrow, that not above six Boats could Land at once;
and it was evident, that though the Enemy should chance to be beaten from behind
his Breastworks, yet the <i>Hollanders</i> would lie expos’d to the Enemy’s Guns from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>Fort <i>Nazareth</i> built on the Mountain; besides, <i>Nazareth</i>, if gain’d, could scarce be
defended, unless the whole Mountain were Intrench’d round, which would not
onely be very chargeable, but also impossible, because of the red Earth, altogether
unfit for Fortifications; and the barren Mountain afforded neither Wood, nor any
thing else; besides, the Storming of it would be very dangerous: The Entrance
into the Haven was difficult, because a stonie Bank before the same suffer’d no Passage
but betwixt small Openings; the chiefest whereof was guarded by a WaterCastle,
and farther within by the Fort <i>Puntael</i>. Along the Sea-shore their Landing
was prevented by the violent beating of the Waves, and a great square Tower on
the Way up to the Fort <i>Nazareth</i>, whose Church is seen at a great distance off at Sea.
All which consider’d, they judg’d it best to draw off their Men again, and so they
return’d without having effected any thing to the purpose, onely Captain <i>Schuppe</i>
took two Carvels with five hundred Chests of Sugar in the River <i>Formosa</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The City of <i>Garasu</i> surprised by the <i>Hollanders</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Soon after <i>Martin Thyszoon</i> being sent out with twenty two Sail, sent four Ships
for <i>Holland</i> with the Lieutenant-Colonel <i>Stein Callenfels</i>, and the Councellor <i>Serooskerken</i>;
yet thirteen Sail remain’d still before the Coast of <i>Brasile</i>, under the Command
of Captain <i>John Mast</i>, who whilest he stood to and again from the Shore,
and Cruising up and down, the Governor of <i>Reciffa</i> and Colonel <i>Rembach</i> march’d
with five hundred Men and forty <i>Negro</i>’s, from <i>Reciffa</i> about six a Clock at Night,
by <i>Olinda</i> along the Shore: Whereupon the <i>Portuguese</i> Horse-watch ran instantly to
<i>Real</i>, two Leagues from <i>Olinda</i>, to give notice thereof to <i>Albuquerque</i>; but they surmounted
all the Difficulties they met with by the Way (which were the greater in
regard of the abundance of Rain that had lately fall’n,) and on the first of <i>May</i> 1632,
came to the City <i>Garasu</i> about Noon; where whilest <i>Rembach</i> stood still in good order
with three Companies, the Governor of <i>Reciffa</i> fell upon the Town with three
Companies. The Inhabitants had not the least thoughts of being molested by the
<i>Netherlanders</i> there, because they judg’d the Ways which led thither could not be
pass’d in that rainy Season. In the first Onset a hundred <i>Portugueses</i>, most of them
great Merchants, were slain, they being come thither with their Goods from <i>Olinda</i>;
and amongst the Prisoners which they took, were six <i>Franciscans</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Victory the <i>Hollanders</i> obtain’d with the loss but of eight Men, and twenty
five wounded, besides Captain <i>Rembach</i>, who was also wounded. The Governor
of <i>Reciffa</i> entering the City, stav’d two hundred Pipes of Wine, to keep his Soldiers
from over-drinking; and because there were many fair Women there, he caus’d
them all to be lock’d up in the Church of <i>St. Cosmo</i>, to preserve them from the Soldiers
outrages.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of <i>Garasu</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Priest <i>Duarte Mendez Serraon</i> (a Letter of whose <i>John de Laet</i> quotes) values the
Booty carry’d away by the <i>Hollanders</i> from <i>Garasu</i>, at 9000 l. <i>Sterl.</i> besides the damage
which the Place suffer’d, being almost ruin’d. He relates farther, That the
City call’d <i>Villa de Santo Cosmo de Garasu</i> lay five Leagues to the Northward from
<i>Olinda</i>; and that in it were three Churches, <i>viz.</i> <i>Cosmus</i>, <i>Misericordia</i>, and <i>Heremitage
de Santa Crux</i>; as also two Cloysters, <i>viz.</i> <i>Invocation de Antonio</i>, inhabited by
<i>Capuchins</i>, and another dedicated to <i>Franciscus</i>, inhabited by Persons of his Order;
That the chief Church <i>Cosmus</i>, built like a flat-roof’d House, had a fair Entrance,
before which stood two Turrets, and in them hung Bells; That the <i>Franciscan</i>
Cloyster was inclos’d within a great Wall in the middle of a pleasant Garden, and
had on each side a Tower; That most of the People who kept the Feast of <i>St. Philip</i>
and <i>St. Jacob</i>, were at <i>Mass</i> when the <i>Hollanders</i> came thither, and though they
saw the Soldiers out of their Windows, judg’d them to be <i>Portugueses</i>, who (as it
was reported) had a Design upon <i>Tamarica</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_542'>542</span>The Governor of <i>Reciffa</i> marching with his Booty from <i>Garusa</i>, set several Houses
on fire, and march’d towards the Fort <i>Orange</i>, on the Island <i>Tamarica</i>. <i>Albuquerque</i>
inform’d thereof, dispatch’d a <i>Spanish</i> Regiment, Commanded by Colonel <i>Ferdinand
Ludovico Barbalho</i>, and <i>Paulo de Perado</i>, with a considerable Body of Volunteers; but
they all came too late: Whereupon the <i>Portugueses</i>, being thus kept in continual
Alarms ashore, and sustaining every day more and more Losses at Sea, began to
desire Peace, and the rather, because they could not hear of any Fleet coming from
<i>Spain</i> to their assistance; and hearing a Report, that the <i>West-India</i> Company were
making great Preparations. To which purpose <i>Peter Alvares</i> (acquainted with the
<i>Dutch</i> Commanders, as having been their Prisoner) was sent by <i>Duarte de Albuquerque</i>
(to whom the Lordship of <i>Pernambuco</i> properly belong’d) and by his Brother
(being General of all the Forces in <i>Brasile</i>) to <i>Reciffa</i>, to Treat about the deciding
of the Differences between them and the <i>Netherland West-India</i> Company: But the
Council in <i>Reciffa</i> weighing the many Disadvantages that would ensue, if they
should upon easie Terms patch up a Peace with the <i>Portugueses</i>, return’d <i>Alvares</i> this
Answer: “That the <i>West-India</i> Company was resolv’d, to the utmost of their
power, to keep all those Places which they had taken by force of Arms; but that
if he could move <i>Albuquerque</i> to deliver up the Countrey to them, he should be
bountifully rewarded.”</p>

<p class='c010'>After this the <i>Hollanders</i> Landing at <i>Barra Grande</i>, took great quantities of Wine
and Tobacco, and burnt two Villages; as also the Sugar-Cane Fields, and Sugar-Mills
on <i>Catuwanha</i>, also one at <i>Barra Grande</i>, and three at <i>Porto Francisco</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the same time the <i>Hollanders</i> also scatter’d Letters amongst the <i>Portuguese</i>, signifying
their trouble for the great effusion of Blood in those Parts, which was occasion’d
by their own stubborn and unreasonable Proceedings; likewise intimating
the great Preparations that were making on their own part, and on the other
side the great unlikelihood, and indeed impossibility, as things then stood, of
receiving farther Succors from <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Hollanders</i> Counsels betray’d to the <i>Portuguese</i> by <i>Leonard van Lom</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>These things being powerfully urg’d, had perhaps taken greater effect with
the <i>Portugueses</i>, had not the secret Counsels of the <i>Netherlanders</i> been betray’d
by <i>Leonard van Lom</i>, Overseer of the Prizes, and Translater of the <i>Portuguese</i> Letters,
who confess’d that he was perswaded to that villanous Action in <i>Amsterdam</i> by a <i>Portuguese</i>
Merchant, call’d <i>Duarte Rodrigues Delves</i>, with whom he had made some
Agreement; and for the better confirmation had receiv’d the <i>Sacrament</i> upon it of
an <i>Amsterdam</i> Priest: His Agreement was, “That he should go to <i>Reciffa</i>, enquire
after all Concerns, and give speedy advice thereof to <i>Rocque de Barros</i>; which he
did by a <i>Mulatto</i>, who carry’d Letters between them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This Villain the Council judging worthy of Death, first caus’d his two fore-Fingers
to be cut off, next his Head, and afterwards his Body to be divided into
four Quarters. The <i>Mulatto</i> was likewise Beheaded.</p>

<p class='c010'>About this time the Treasurer <i>Ceulen</i> viewing the Isle <i>Mayo</i>, found the same to be
surrounded with steep Rocks, abounding with Horses, Asses, Partridges and Goats,
besides two Salt-pans. The Inhabitants, which go Arm’d with Half-pikes and
rusty Hangers, are said to be a sort of out-law’d <i>Portugueses</i>, to the number of thirty,
amongst whom was one Woman. They had a Governor, call’d <i>Amaro</i>, to whom
they gave yearly eight thousand Goat-skins.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Ceulen</i> Sailing from hence Steer’d by the Island <i>Del Fogo</i>, known by a great
Mountain, whose high top vomits Fire. Not far from which he took the Ship
<i>St. Peter</i> laden with Wine, with which he return’d safe to <i>Reciffa</i>, where a while
after <i>Gysselling</i> arriv’d also, and was no sooner Landed, but four Ships, two Sloops,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_543'>543</span>six Cock-boats, a Barque and a Hoy, set Sail under the Conduct of <i>John Mast</i> with
four or five Companies of choice Musquetteers, Commanded by Colonel <i>Schuppe</i>,
who Landed behind the stonie Bank of the River <i>Alexio</i>, surpris’d some <i>Portuguese</i>
and <i>Negro</i>’s in their Houses, and march’d in the Night so fast, that by Day-break
they were got to the Shore of the River <i>Formosa</i>, where they took two rich laden
Fly-boats and a Carvel; and afterwards Landing in the Road <i>Camarigibi</i>, they took
fifty <i>Portuguese</i> in a Village, as also a Store-house full of Chests with Sugar and Tobacco,
burnt all the Buildings thereabouts, and amongst others a brave Sugar-Mill:
Captain <i>Byma</i> burnt also an eminent Sugar-Mill near the Brook <i>Maria Farinha</i>.
<i>Martin Thyszoon</i> lay a long time under the <i>Line</i>; but at last getting to the Isle
<i>Vacca</i> he gave each Captain his Orders, and divided the Fleet, which joyn’d again
before <i>Havana</i>, pass’d through the Straights <i>Bahama</i> (where he met with great
Storms, and many other Inconveniences) to <i>Holland</i>. But <i>Galeyn van Stapels</i>, who
parted with a Frigat from <i>Thyszoons</i> Fleet near <i>Bonaire</i>, Steer’d by the Promontory
<i>Cotoche</i> to <i>Sisal</i>; which Village having plunder’d, he set it on fire, fetch’d a Barque
in the Night from the Road of <i>Campeche</i> (whose City is seen at a great distance off at
Sea, by the white Cloyster <i>Francisco</i>) and so set Sail for <i>Zealand</i>. <i>Houte-been</i> arriv’d
also about the middle of <i>June</i> with a rich Booty in the <i>Texel</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Schuppe</i> and <i>Lichthart</i> take the Fort <i>Formosa</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Not long after <i>Houte-been</i> weighing Anchor with the <i>Otter</i> Frigat, return’d to
<i>Reciffa</i>, and in his Way thither took a Ship laden with Wine. Colonel <i>Schuppe</i> immediately
upon his arrival had a Command given him of five hundred Men, and
<i>John Lichthart</i> of three Sail of Ships, a Pinnace and five Sloops; with which they set
Sail to the River <i>Formosa</i>. <i>Schuppe</i> Landing his Men there, march’d up to the Fort
<i>Formosa</i>, fortifi’d with Moats, steep high Walls, and four Guns, Storm’d and took
the same, killing all those that were in the Garrison, except the Governor <i>Peter Albuquerque</i>:
In which Victory nevertheless the <i>Hollanders</i> lost the valiant Captain
<i>Philbert du Basson</i>, who being shot in at the Throat with a Bullet, which came out
behind the Ear, dy’d of the same, the Wound immediately festering, to which all
Wounds are very subject in <i>Brasile</i>. The <i>Hollanders</i> also burnt four laden Barques, a
Store-house full of Sugar, and pull’d down the Fort they had taken.</p>

<p class='c010'>Setting Sail again, they Landed to the Northward of the River <i>Antonio Grande</i>,
where they gain’d a Platform with five Guns, destroy’d six Ships, and took two
more in the Haven <i>Camarigibi</i>; from whence they return’d to <i>Reciffa</i>, after having
spoil’d and taken thirteen of the <i>Portuguese</i> Ships, several Sugar-Mills, Store-houses,
and a Castle.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Swol</i> Frigat came also in a shatter’d condition to <i>Reciffa</i>, having been Engag’d
with a <i>Spanish</i> Gallion carrying twenty eight great Guns, and full of Men,
which nevertheless she would have master’d, had not an unfortunate Shot spoil’d
all her Rigging.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the same time the Captains <i>Byma</i>, <i>Everwyn</i>, and <i>Rinking</i>, set Sail with their
Companies in three Ships to <i>Porto Francisco</i>, where Landing, they burnt three Sugar-Mills,
besides several other brave Buildings, and brought away a rich Carvel,
whilest <i>Laurence van Rembach</i> was made Colonel in <i>Waerdenberg</i>’s place, and <i>Sigismond
Schuppe</i> Lieutenant-Colonel.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Proffers which the <i>Tapuyan</i> Agent made to the <i>Hollanders</i> had been very advantageous,
had not the Summer Season been too far spent: for he had promis’d,
That if they would Land a considerable Party of Men two Leagues Southward
from the River <i>Grande</i>, all the <i>Tapuyans</i> should joyn with them, and assist them in
driving the <i>Portuguese</i> out of <i>Brasile</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>After this <i>Schuppe</i> and <i>Lichthart</i> went with thirteen Companies of Soldiers, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span>two hundred Seamen, to fall upon the Enemy’s Camp at the <i>Afogados</i>, where <i>Albuquerque</i>
had rais’d several Works, partly for the securing of <i>Verga</i>, the best Spot of
Land in all <i>Pernambuco</i>, where there are likewise more Sugar-Mills than in the
whole Countrey, and partly to keep an open Way between <i>Arryal</i> and the Promontory
<i>St. Augustine</i>: To which purpose they march’d by the Fort <i>Æmilia</i> along the
plain Countrey, to the Stream <i>Capivaribi</i>, which they had cross’d before the <i>Portuguese</i>
knew any thing of their approach, who being but a hundred and thirty, forsook
their Works and ran into the Woods; but assisted with four Companies of
<i>Italians</i>, they Sally’d out of <i>Real</i> and fell with great eagerness on the Seamen, who
being guarded by forty Musquetteers were raising of Works in the Road which
leads to <i>Real</i>, and put them to flight; but being rally’d, and seconded by Colonel
<i>Redburgh</i>, they drove the Enemy into a By-way, guarded by <i>Byma</i> and <i>Bongarson</i>;
where being stopt, and Captain <i>Cloppenburgh</i> from another side falling in amongst
them with his Musquetteers, they became encompass’d, and had been all slain, had
not <i>Le Grande</i>, by making way for <i>Cloppenburgh</i>, given them an opportunity of getting
away between them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Council at <i>Reciffa</i>, to secure the footing which they had got on the other
side of the River <i>Capavaribi</i>, took order about the building of a Fort, which requir’d
the greater Labor, because the Earth was very stonie: not far from whence Captain
<i>John Smith</i> walking, was shot by a Party of <i>Portuguese</i> lying behind some Chests
of Sugar; the Blow whereof giving notice to his Ensign, he speedily march’d thither,
and surprising the <i>Portuguese</i>, kill’d most part of them. The like success had
<i>Le Grande</i>, <i>Cloppenburgh</i>, and <i>Bongarson</i>, who marching out upon a Design, surpris’d
unawares in <i>John de Mendoza</i>’s Sugar-Mill, two Companies of <i>Portuguese</i>, who having
watch’d there the whole Night, and composing themselves in the Morning to
sleep, were set upon, and most of them kill’d, and the old Commander <i>Antonio Ortizo
de Mendoza</i> taken, who not long before came thither with a Regiment of <i>Portugueses</i>;
the Sugar-Mill was also set on fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>These successful Expeditions still adding to the <i>Hollanders</i> fresh Courage, they
follow’d the career of their Successes, and placing three Companies in the Works of
the <i>Afogados</i>, drew their Army into three Divisions; Colonel <i>Rembach</i> was to Command
the Forlorn; <i>Schuppe</i>, the main Body; and <i>Byma</i>, the Reserve; in which Order
they waded through the River <i>Capivaribi</i>, placing some Musquetteers in a House
built near the High-way, to secure their Return that way, and came without any
resistance to the <i>Arryal</i>; where they found a long Street, with Shops on each side
full of all sorts of Goods, which they pillag’d, notwithstanding the Enemy fir’d
furiously from the Castle upon them, and wounded Colonel <i>Rembach</i> and Captain
<i>Redburgh</i>. To the Northward before the Castle lay a Redoubt with two Guns,
which <i>Schuppe</i> mastering, kill’d all that were in the same; but being too weak to
carry away the Guns, he nail’d up the Touch-holes, and march’d off with his Men,
but in such disorder, that the <i>Portuguese</i> Sallying out of their Garrison, fell in
amongst them in that manner, that they were not able to bring away their wounded
Men, amongst whom was Captain <i>Redburgh</i>; and it had been worse, had not
<i>Rembach</i> (who though he was shot in at the Shoulder, under the Blade-bone whereof
lay the Bullet) kept them off till such time as the <i>Hollanders</i> were got over the River
<i>Capivaribi</i>, near the fore-mention’d House, guarded by a Company of Musquetteers,
who kill’d above fifty of the <i>Portugueses</i>, besides fifty that had been slain in the former
Skirmishes; the <i>Hollanders</i> themselves also had lost a hundred and thirty Men:
yet notwithstanding they ceased not, but march’d in Parties through all parts of
<i>Verga</i>, where they met with no opposition, but found the Sugar-Mills full of Sugar,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>left to be kept by a few <i>Negro</i>’s. <i>Rembach</i> also sent a Drummer to <i>Real</i>, to demand
the Wounded, especially Colonel <i>Redburgh</i>, with a Letter from the Prisoner <i>Antonio
Mendoza</i>, requesting the Governor <i>Albuquerque</i> and Duke of <i>Bagnola</i>, that they
would be pleas’d to release the <i>Hollanders</i> on Exchange, or else upon Ransom.
The Drummer being civilly Entertain’d by <i>Albuquerque</i>, brought back with him a
strange Oyl call’d <i>Aury</i>, for the wounded <i>Mendoza</i>; with which a Wound made by
a Bullet being anointed about three fingers breadth, it draws out the same. <i>Bagnola</i>
afterwards sent it to <i>Rembach</i>, in requital for his kindness in sending <i>Mendoza</i> in a
Hammock to <i>Real</i>. Mean while the <i>Hollanders</i> still fortifi’d their Works at the <i>Afogados</i>
with Pallisado’s and Platforms, on which they put five Guns. They likewise
work’d daily on the fore-mention’d Castle, whilest <i>Schuppe</i> march’d with four hundred
Men in the Night over the River <i>Jangada</i> to <i>Moribeca</i>; which approaching,
he perceiv’d the Way stopt up with fell’d Trees; wherefore he march’d about to the
Village, which he found forsaken by the Inhabitants, and all the Houses left empty,
onely five hundred Chests of Sugar that had been brought thither from <i>Verga</i>
which <i>Schuppe</i> Commanded to be set on fire with the Village, leaving onely the
Church, and at his Return burnt also a Sugar-Mill.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Articles between the <i>West-India</i> Company and the King of <i>Spain</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Governor <i>Albuquerque</i> having formerly never spar’d any <i>Hollanders</i> which
fell into his hands, began now to be better advis’d; and it was also Agreed upon
between the King of <i>Spain</i> and <i>States</i> of the <i>United Netherlands</i>, That they should
burn no Church, unless the one, or the other Party made resistance in the same;
That the Victor should be oblig’d, upon request of Quarter, to spare his Enemies,
and release the Prisoners for an indifferent sum of Money; That both Parties
should forbear to use chew’d or poyson’d Bullets.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Schuppe</i> being chosen Chief over the <i>Militia</i> in <i>Rembach</i>’s Place (who dy’d of his
Wound,) lay not long still, but setting Sail with eleven Ships to the Isle <i>Tamarica</i>,
Landed seven Companies before the Castle <i>Nostra Sennora de Conception</i>; which,
though well provided and fortifi’d, the Governor <i>Pignioro</i> surrendred, on Condition
that he might depart with all his Men and the Church Ornaments.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Matthias Van Ceulen</i> and <i>Schuppe</i> Rowing up the Stream <i>Goiana</i> with Sloops and
Boats, put to flight <i>Laurence Cavalcanti</i>, burnt divers Sugar-Mills, and took abundance
of rich Merchandize: Ten days they made havock in the middle of their
Enemies Countreys without any resistance; for all of them fled to the <i>Aldas</i>,
(so they call the <i>Brasilian</i> Villages): At last they return’d home with great Booty,
especially of Sugar and <i>Brasile</i> Wood; whilest those at <i>Reciffa</i> were not idle, doing
the <i>Portuguese</i> great mischief by their continual Sallies, <i>Tourlong</i> burning a Fishers
Village, and <i>Bongarson</i> a stately Banquetting-house belonging to <i>Cavalcant</i> near
<i>Arryal</i>; as also <i>Pedro Acunha de Andada</i>’s Sugar-Mill, from whence he took great
Booty.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Portuguese</i> begin to fall off to the <i>Hollanders</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Jacob Huigen</i> slain.</div>

<p class='c010'>About the same time the <i>Portuguese</i> of several Parts, terrifi’d by continual Alarms
and Losses, began to incline to the <i>West-India</i> Company, believing that they should
utterly be ruin’d, if they continu’d to joyn with <i>Albuquerque</i>’s Party (who claim’d
<i>Pernambuco</i> wholly to himself) and therefore car’d not whether he or the <i>Hollanders</i>
were Masters, so they might live peaceably. Mean while the <i>Hollanders</i> march’d from
the <i>Afogados</i> to <i>Arryal</i>: <i>Schuppe</i> marching before with two hundred and fifty Seamen,
was follow’d by the Lieutenant-Colonel <i>De Vries</i>, and he by a Company of
<i>Negro</i>’s that carry’d Provisions; next <i>Byma</i> march’d with the Reserve. The Treasurer
<i>John Gyseling</i> also accompanied the Army, which Encamp’d near <i>Francisco Brito
Machado</i>’s Wind-Mill, and Garrison’d the half-finish’d Fort near the Sugar-Mill belonging
to <i>Marcus Andre</i>, whilest three Companies Commanded by Captain <i>De Vries</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_546'>546</span>march’d to <i>Monteroos-Mills</i> to take the same; but the <i>Portuguese</i> lying in an Ambuscade
had given them a shrewd Rebuke, had not <i>Schuppe</i>, hearing the Guns, sent away
the Captains <i>Picard</i> and <i>Garstman</i>, who coming out from amongst the Sugar-Canes,
put the Enemy to flight; yet the <i>Portuguese</i> to increase daily, insomuch that
they got above two thousand Men together at <i>Arryal</i>, whilest the <i>Dutch</i> Army began
to want Provisions, wherefore <i>Jacob Huigen</i> was order’d to fetch a Supply from
<i>Reciffa</i>; but as he was coming up the River with the <i>Exeter</i> Ketch, and a Boat hung
about with Hides to secure his Men from the Bullets, and being within Musquet-shot
from the Works where Captain <i>Schuppe</i> lay, the Enemy’s whole Power shot
so vehemently upon him from the top of a Hill, that both the Ketch and Boat
were sunk; <i>Huigen</i> himself receiv’d two mortal Wounds, and most of his Men were
kill’d, a few wounded onely escaping with Life. <i>Schuppe</i> therefore was forc’d to
return for want of Provisions, and the rather, because he was inform’d that <i>Bagnola</i>
was coming with a Supply of seven hundred Men.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mean while the two Captains, <i>Smient</i> and <i>Dunkirken</i> perform’d a valiant Exploit,
<i>viz.</i> they went with a few Men in a Boat, and took a great <i>Portuguese</i> Vessel richly
laden, having no more than four Blunderbusses and their Swords in the Boat
with them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A notable Victory of <i>Byma</i> over <i>Francisco Almeda</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Byma</i> also fell upon the Village <i>Moriwere</i>, where he found most of the People at
Church. <i>Albuquerque</i> inform’d thereof, sent two hundred Men immediately, Commanded
by <i>Francisco Almeda</i>, to intercept him in his Return; but he marching on to
<i>Tamarica</i>, they pursu’d him; he marching but slowly, because the narrow Way was
stopt up with fell’d Trees, they overtook him half a League beyond <i>Garasu</i>, near
<i>Peter Rocha</i>’s Sugar-Mill; where after a sharp Encounter between them, a great
slaughter was made amongst the <i>Spaniards</i>, <i>Almeda</i> and many other Persons being
slain, and the rest put to flight. <i>Byma</i> having obtain’d this Victory, march’d to <i>Garusa</i>
and burnt the same, sparing onely the Churches and Cloysters, according to
the Articles made between <i>Albuquerque</i> and <i>Rembach</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Schuppe</i> prevented from crossing the River <i>Jangada</i> by the many muddy Creek,
return’d back to <i>Reciffa</i> with great Booty, which he had taken out of a Store-house.
The <i>Dutch</i> Cruisers also brought in many Prizes.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Exploits perform’d by <i>John Johnszoon van Hoorn</i>, with four Ships, three
Ketches, and a Sloop, are likewise very remarkable; for with this Fleet in the
first place he took the City <i>Truxillo</i>, and from thence Sailing towards the City <i>Campeche</i>,
and Storming the same valiantly, soon became Master of it; the Booty of
which two Places being brought aboard, increas’d considerably the <i>West-India</i> Companies
Stock.</p>

<p class='c010'>In regard <i>Albuquerque</i> understood the Situation of <i>Pernambuco</i> better than the <i>Hollanders</i>,
and had all the Natives to assist him, and by consequence was the better able
to defend himself against their continual Alarms, the Council at <i>Reciffa</i> therefore
judg’d it convenient to make a farther Voyage to the South, that the <i>Portuguese</i>, who
were highly discontented about the Losses which they had sustain’d, might be the
sooner induc’d to submit to their Government: To which purpose ten Ketches,
Mann’d with seven hundred Soldiers, besides Seamen, set Sail on the tenth of <i>October</i>,
under the Command of <i>John Gyseling</i>, <i>Schuppe</i>, and <i>Servaes Carpentier</i>, who first
ran into the River <i>Porto de Piedras</i>, where they took a considerable number of
Chests of Sugar, out of Mills, Barques, and Store-houses, waded through the little
Scream <i>Tatona Mansa</i>, burnt a Village of the same Denomination, and Sail’d to the
River <i>Camarigibi</i>, which they Rowing up in the Night, were got not above four
Leagues by Day-break, the contrary Tide, and the Plants call’d <i>Mangues</i> having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_547'>547</span>hindred them from getting farther; but being inform’d by certain <i>Portuguese</i> Prisoners,
that abundance of Sugar lay in <i>Porto Francisco</i>, they marching thither, found
under a Straw Roof in a Wood, seventy four Chests of Sugar, and a great deal more
in several Store-houses. They also pillag’d the whole Countrey towards <i>Alagoa
del Noort</i>, <i>St. Miguel</i>, and <i>Alagoa del Zur</i>. Not far from which <i>Schuppe</i> falling upon
the Village <i>Sennora de Conception</i>, burnt the same, as also a Ship upon the Stocks,
the Houses at the Mouth of the Stream <i>Alagoa</i>, and the Tackling belonging to the
two Ships, and carry’d away with them a very great Booty.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Tourlon</i> also march’d with four Companies from <i>Tamarica</i> to <i>Mangianguape</i>, where
the Garrison from <i>Garasu</i>; and some <i>Jesuits</i> lay, to disswade the People from submitting
themselves to the <i>West-India</i> Company, to which they were much inclin’d.
But <i>Tourlon</i> march’d not so privately, but that the Enemy had notice thereof, and
fled; wherefore he finding <i>Mangianguape</i> empty, offer’d the same to the Flames, as
also several Sugar-Mills, but spar’d the Lives of all those who begg’d Quarter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Byma</i>’s bold Attempt.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Byma</i> about the same time with a hundred and forty Musquetteers, besides two
Companies of Seamen, leaving the <i>Afogados</i> in the Night, march’d to <i>Amaro</i> by Daybreak,
which he set on fire, with a Sugar-Mill and a Store-house full of Sugar,
after every Soldier had taken as much as he could carry: upon which the Enemy
taking Alarm, plac’d their Ambuscades so cunningly, and fell upon them so furiously,
that they had undoubtedly kill’d every Man of them, had not a Party come
in timely to their assistance, and forc’d the <i>Portuguese</i> to fly to a neighboring Sugar-Mill
built on a Hill, from whence they fir’d with great eagerness, and made a
mighty noise, blowing their Trumpets and beating their Drums. <i>Byma</i> being forced
to pass by the Mill within the reach of the Enemy’s Guns, resolv’d upon a bold
Attempt, and commanding his Men to throw away their Sugar, and other Booty
with which they burthen’d themselves, on a sudden ran up to the top of the Hill;
which Action so amaz’d the <i>Portuguese</i>, that they fled without offering the least resistance.
<i>Byma</i> thereupon proceeded on his Way to the <i>Afogados</i>, leaving behind him
above seventy slain, and divers wounded.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Prizes taken by <i>Smient</i> and <i>Lichthart</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>During these Exploits on Shore, the Commander <i>Smient</i> Cruis’d with six Sail
before <i>Paraiba</i>; two Ships belonging to his Fleet steering towards the Haven of
<i>Formosa</i>, discover’d five Carvels, a Pink carrying twenty six, and a great Fly-boat
eighteen Guns, both <i>Dunkirkers</i>; one of the Carvels ran aground, and was stav’d to
pieces, two of them got into <i>Rio Grande</i>, and the other two were taken.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the same time <i>Lichthart</i> with two Sloops pass’d into the River <i>Conayou</i>, set
upon seven Barques of the <i>Portuguese</i>, Mann’d with seventy Seamen, and ply’d
them with his Brass Guns after such a manner, that few escap’d with their Lives:
he took what he thought fit out of the Barques, and afterwards set them on
fire.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Van Ceulen</i>’s Expedition.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Treasurer <i>Matthias van Ceulen</i> weighed Anchor with four Ships and seven
Ketches, Mann’d with eight hundred Men, with which he set Sail to <i>Rio Grande</i>,
with intention to fall upon the Fort <i>Tres Reyes</i>. In the River he took two Carvels,
though they lay close under the Castle, Landed a Company of Soldiers, and a hundred
and fifty Seamen on the Southern Shore, guarded the fresh River with Boats,
march’d directly to <i>Tres Reyes</i>, and Encamp’d himself near the Redoubt which lay
before the Castle, being follow’d by <i>Byma</i>, <i>Garstman</i>, and <i>Cloppenburgh</i>, who in their
Way took a House built on a Hill, and considerable Booty in it. <i>Byma</i> getting
about Noon to the Village <i>Natall</i>, left some of his Men there, whilest he march’d
with the rest to the Castle <i>Tres Reyes</i>. <i>Ceulen</i> sending to demand the Castle, receiv’d
at first a resolute denyal from the Governor <i>Peter Mendez de Govea</i>; but when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_548'>548</span>Besieged saw the <i>Hollanders</i> resolutely bent upon a Storm, they sent to desire a Treaty,
and after some small Capitulation the Castle was surrendred upon Articles. <i>Garstman</i>
being made Commander of the Castle, had a hundred and fifty Soldiers allow’d
him. The Fleet set Sail again, after they had pull’d down and destroy’d all the
Works which had been rais’d, and made the Inhabitants take an Oath to be faithful
to <i>Garstman</i>, who chang’d the Name of the Castle from <i>Tres Reyes</i> to that of <i>Ceulen</i>,
being the Name of the Treasurer, who bore the chiefest Command in the Siege,
and when the <i>Brasilian</i> King <i>Jandui</i> came with a great Train to congratulate the
Companies success, receiv’d him with great civility.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the beginning of the Year 1634. twenty six Sail weighed Anchor from <i>Reciffa</i>,
to Cruise up and down in Squadrons before the Inlet <i>Todos los Sanctos</i>, the Promontory
<i>St. Augustine</i>, the Rivers <i>Francisco</i> and <i>Parayba</i>. <i>Schuppe</i> and <i>Lichthart</i> also set Sail
with two Ships, a Ketch, two Pinnaces, and a Sloop, carrying two hundred Soldiers
besides Seamen.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lichthart</i> drives the <i>Portuguese</i> out of the <i>Puntael</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Mean while fresh Forces were sent from the <i>Texel</i>, the <i>Maes</i> and <i>Zeland</i>, to <i>Reciffa</i>,
where the Council undertook another notable Design, <i>viz.</i> to surprize the
Forts along the River <i>Parayba</i>: whither coming with twenty Sail, they divided
themselves into two Squadrons under the Command of the Treasurer <i>John Gyseling</i>,
<i>Schuppe</i>, <i>Servaes Carpentier</i>, and <i>Lichthart</i>. Having receiv’d some repulse at the
Fort <i>Nazaretta</i>, they resolv’d upon Action in some other place, and to that purpose
Steer’d towards the Point <i>St. Augustine</i>; by Day-break a part of the Fleet ran into
the Mouth of the Haven, notwithstanding the <i>Portuguese</i> fir’d upon them with great
Guns from the Castle, and all their Works, without doing any considerable
damage, onely the <i>Sea-knight</i> Ketch running aground was Shatter’d all to pieces;
whilest the <i>Hollanders</i> Commanded by Captain <i>Lichthart</i> Landed near <i>Puntael</i>, and
fell upon the <i>Portuguese</i> in such a manner, that they forc’d them to forsake the Place,
burnt above two thousand Chests of Sugar, several Store-houses, and a great
Ship, besides two Barques.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>They endeavor in vain to regain the <i>Puntael</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Lichthart</i> being Master of the <i>Puntael</i>, was very busie in finishing a Stone Redoubt
which the Enemy had begun, and secur’d it by a Wall and Pallisado’s. Here
he plac’d two Companies, and rais’d several Works, whilest the <i>Portuguese</i> receiving
Aid from all the neighboring Places, set upon the recovery of the <i>Puntael</i>, being
the rather encourag’d thereunto, in regard the <i>Hollanders</i> Forces were still in their
Ships. Fifteen hundred <i>Portugueses</i> were divided into two Parties, the greatest of
which came through behind the adjacent Morasses, and forc’d in on the side of the
place near which the fifteen Ships taken by <i>Lichthart</i> lay at an Anchor, whilest the
other Party fell upon the Out-works; where though the <i>Hollanders</i> defended themselves
valiantly at first, yet they were forc’d to Retreat to the Redoubt, where both
Parties fought with great eagerness; but the <i>Hollanders</i> Ketches haling near the Shore,
and firing in amongst the <i>Portuguese</i> with their great Guns, forc’d them to flye, and
contrary to their Custom, to leave their dead Bodies behind them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Soon after, whilest <i>Gysseling</i>, <i>Schuppe</i>, and <i>Lichthart</i> stay’d at the <i>Puntael</i>, the <i>Portuguese</i>,
designing to take <i>Reciffa</i>, kept the <i>Afogados</i> and the Fort on <i>Antonio Vaes</i> in
continual Alarm; which made the <i>Hollanders</i> send most of their <i>Militia</i> thither, and
to fortifie yet more strongly than before. The Castle <i>De Bruin</i> first discovering the
<i>Portuguese</i> wading through the Water, fir’d great Guns at them, upon the hearing
of which <i>Waerdenburgh</i> and <i>St. George</i> fir’d also. The Treasurer <i>Ceulen</i> and Lieutenant-Colonel
<i>Byma</i> march’d with a Company of Soldiers to the Stone Redoubt,
from whence they fir’d stoutly upon the Enemy; yet thirty of them got by the
Pallisado’s and Stone Redoubt: wherefore <i>Ceulen</i> march’d in with some of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_549'>549</span>Men to assist the Citizens, and keep the woodden Battery, where the <i>Portuguese</i>
were stopt, and with great and small Shot put to flight. The Prisoners which the
<i>Hollanders</i> took inform’d them, That <i>Martin Suares</i>, chief Commander over the <i>Portuguese</i>
that made this Attempt, had divided his Men into three Parties; the Reserve,
which consisted of three hundred Men, was to march on upon the making of a sign
when the other Parties were past, one along the River <i>Bibiriba</i>, and the other along
the Shore by the Stone Redoubt into <i>Reciffa</i>, to burn the Place, as also all manner
of Provision and Ammunition.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Byma</i> attempts the taking of <i>Real</i>, but without success.</div>

<p class='c010'>Whilest this Design of the <i>Portuguese</i> fell out so unfortunately, being discover’d to
<i>Ceulen</i> by a Renegado, the <i>Hollanders</i> at <i>Reciffa</i> receiv’d two Companies from their
Regiment at the <i>Puntael</i>, and a considerable number of Men rais’d in <i>Holland</i> by the
<i>West India</i> Company. <i>Ceulen</i> and <i>Byma</i> thus supply’d, went continually out in Parties,
burnt in view of the Garrison in <i>Arryal</i> the Sugar-Mills belonging to <i>Francisco
Montero</i> and <i>Lewis Ramires</i>, and were inform’d by five <i>Italian</i> Renegado’s, That
there were not three hundred Men in Garrison in <i>Arryal</i>; which so encourag’d <i>Byma</i>,
that he resolving to fall upon the same, march’d thither in the Night with a thousand
Men from <i>Reciffa</i>, and by Day-break shot sixteen Granado’s from a neighboring
Hill, of which seven fell into <i>Arryal</i>, but did little Execution; besides, the
Strength of the Place was such, and the number of Men so considerable, that his
Design had no other success, than that a Hand-granado falling short amongst the
Houses before the Fort, set fire on them, and in a short time burnt a whole Street
with rich Shops, and the Habitations of the <i>Italians</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Portuguese</i> at the <i>Puntael</i> being inform’d, that <i>Byma</i> had Besieg’d <i>Arryal</i> with a
thousand Men, judg’d that most of the <i>Hollanders</i> were gone thither from the <i>Puntael</i>;
which they were the apter to believe, because the <i>Hollanders</i> coming but little
abroad stay’d within their Redoubts, which <i>Lichthart</i> had joyn’d to a Battery;
wherefore they made another Attempt with a hundred and twenty Men on the
<i>Puntael</i>; but a Carvel with two Brass Guns, and a Company of Soldiers lying at
Anchor near the Place by which the <i>Portuguese</i> were to pass, and they not expecting
to meet with any resistance there, they were, as soon as they approached the Carvel,
fir’d upon by the <i>Hollanders</i>, who killing several of their Men, so affrighted them,
that they return’d without making any farther Attempt.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Overtures of Peace from the <i>Portuguese</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Whilest every day more and more Prizes were taken by the <i>Hollanders</i>, and
brought into <i>Reciffa</i>, and fresh Supplies sent them from <i>Holland</i>, there began to be
some Overtures of Peace from the <i>Portuguese</i>; wherein also the King of <i>Spain</i>, by
reason of the several Damages he had sustain’d from the <i>Dutch</i>, began to concern
himself, and to menace them with the great Forces he was able to raise, by reason
of the late safe arrival of two rich Plate-Fleets, if they came not to reasonable
Terms. But answer was return’d from <i>Byma</i>, “That if they were minded to
Treat about giving of Quarter, or any such like Point in difference between them,
they should find him ready; but that the <i>West-India</i> Company would never resign
those Places taken in <i>Brasile</i> with the Sword, either for Money or Goods,
but would defend them to the utmost of their Power.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Hollanders</i> also chang’d the Names of several Places taken from the <i>Portuguese</i>;
for the Castle near the Promontory <i>St. Augustine</i> was call’d <i>Gysseling</i>; the
Town on <i>Tamarica</i>, <i>Schuppen-stadt</i>; the Fort at the <i>Afogados</i>, <i>Prince William</i>; and the
<i>Puntael</i>, <i>The Fortress Vander Dussen</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Ceulen</i> and <i>Gysseling</i> return home.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Jandur</i>’s great service to the <i>Netherlanders</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Notwithstanding the Requests of the <i>States</i> of the <i>Netherlands</i> and <i>West-India</i> Company,
to the Commissioners <i>Ceulen</i> and <i>Gysseling</i>, to stay longer in the <i>West-Indies</i>,
yet they prepar’d for their Voyage home, and the speedier, because they expected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_550'>550</span>great scarcity of Provisions, unless a sudden Supply came from <i>Holland</i>. During
their two years Government here, they had taken five thousand five hundred and
nineteen Chests of Sugar, a hundred fifty nine thousand nine hundred thirty and
nine Pound of <i>Brasile</i> Wood, one and thirty Ships laden with several Goods, which
amounted to 230000 <i>l.</i> besides the value of the Ships and Guns, the taken Forts,
destroy’d Sugar-Mills, and other Buildings. They left at their going away above
four thousand Soldiers, divided into thirty two Companies, to guard <i>Brasile</i>, under
the Command of <i>Schuppe</i> and <i>Arcisseusky</i>, and carry’d with them a hundred Soldiers,
besides one and fifty sick and maimed: Moreover, thirty two Sail of Ships, Mann’d
with a thousand and eighty seven Seamen, were order’d to Cruise up and down before
the Coast of <i>Brasile</i>, besides four Ketches before the Promontory of <i>St. Augustine</i>,
and six Ships in the Haven of <i>Pernambuco</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>After <i>Ceulen</i> and <i>Gysseling</i> had set Sail for <i>Holland</i>, divers Prizes were brought into
<i>Reciffa</i>, as also several Ships arriv’d there from the <i>Texel</i> and the <i>Maes</i>. The <i>Hollanders</i>
went out continually in Parties, whilest <i>Schuppe</i> and <i>Lichthart</i> set Sail also with
eight Ships, Mann’d with six Companies of Soldiers, besides Seamen, to plunder
and pillage all the Havens to the South, where several <i>Portuguese</i> Vessels lay laden
with Sugar. But <i>Janduy</i>, who with his Subjects the <i>Tapuyans</i>, joyn’d with the Governor
<i>Garstman</i>, kill’d at one time thirty seven <i>Portugueses</i>, and not long after two
hundred and sixty more; taking his leave of <i>Garstman</i>, went home with six <i>Hollanders</i>,
leaving his Son, the young <i>Janduy</i>, and his Brother <i>Caracara</i>, together with
his Nephew <i>Copun</i>, to his care.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Janduy</i> made it his Business to perswade the adjacent <i>Tapuyans</i> to joyn their Forces
with his, and so by the <i>Hollanders</i> assistance to fall upon the <i>Portuguese</i>.  Mean
while the young <i>Janduy</i> and <i>Copun</i> went to <i>Reciffa</i>, which was the rather permitted,
that they might be able to damp the Reports which the <i>Portuguese</i> had spread
amongst the <i>Tapuyans</i>, <i>viz.</i> That the <i>Hollanders</i> were very ill provided, and therefore
made all possible Preparations to defend <i>Reciffa</i>, and consequently the whole
Countrey of <i>Brasile</i>, and so leave those <i>Tapuyans</i> that joyn’d with them to the mercy
of the <i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ambassadors sent to consult with him about carrying on their Designs.</div>

<p class='c010'>Not long after were dispatch’d from thence the Councellors <i>Jacob Stackhower</i>,
and Colonel <i>Arcisseusky</i>, with the Interpreter <i>Antonio Parapoavo</i>, to Treat with <i>Janduy</i>
about the Design which they had upon the <i>Portuguese</i>, and also what Advantages
he should receive, if he would assist the <i>West-India</i> Company with his Forces, whenever
he should be sent to.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>His Power, Enemies, and Allies.</div>

<p class='c010'>King <i>Janduy</i> bore Command over sixteen hundred Men, whose Wives carry’d
their Hammocks after them to sleep on in the Night, having no setled Habitations,
but ranging in Parties up and down from place to place to get their Food; the young
People went commonly along with <i>Beretiawa</i>, and the old with <i>Janduy</i>; round about
whose Countrey dwelt the poor Natives <i>Aciki</i>, as also <i>Juckerijou</i>, <i>Ocioneciou</i>, <i>Pajoke</i>,
and <i>Aponorijou</i>: the first are Commanded by King <i>Coctaculy</i>; the second, by <i>Marakou</i>,
a Friend of the <i>Portugueses</i>; the third, by <i>Nonhu</i>; the fourth, by <i>Kidoa</i>; and
the last, by <i>Jarepo</i>: which two last are no way inferior in Power to <i>Janduy</i>, but the
others much weaker.</p>

<p class='c010'>Four sorts of People continually Warr’d against <i>Janduy</i>, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Jenho</i>, who live
so far up in the Countrey, that no <i>Christians</i> ever came to the knowledge of them;
the other three are the <i>Woyana</i>, <i>Carivy</i>, and <i>Caririwassu</i>, who assist the <i>Portuguese</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fore-mention’d Interpreter <i>Parapoavo</i> was met in his Journey by a Company
of <i>Tapuyans</i>, led by <i>Commendaoura</i>, <i>Janduy</i>’s Sisters Son, who was to succeed
him after his death, according to the Custom of the <i>Tapuyans</i>, whose Sons do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>succeed their Fathers in the Throne, but their Sisters Sons. <i>Commendaoura</i> told him,
That he was impower’d by his Uncle to Treat with the <i>Hollanders</i>; to which purpose
coming with forty Men before the Castle <i>Ceulen</i>, he inform’d them, That
<i>Jandouy</i> could not come to them with his whole Power, because there was no fresh
Water in the Mountains <i>Mitiapa</i> in the Summer; Moreover, that he Mourn’d for
his deceased Wife. <i>Janduoy</i> was also requested to go to <i>Parayba</i>, where he should
get great store of Booty, and that the <i>Hollanders</i> would follow them with a considerable
Power.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fort <i>Conayou</i> taken by <i>Arcisseusky</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Arcisseusky</i> being inform’d of the Condition of <i>Conayou</i> by two, who having been
taken Prisoners by the <i>Portuguese</i>, leap’d over-board from a Carvel, bound from
thence to <i>Portugal</i>, and swam ashore, march’d from the Fort <i>Ceulen</i> in the Night
with two hundred Men, besides forty <i>Tapuyans</i>, who kill’d more Venison for the
<i>Hollanders</i> than they were able to eat; and coming within two Cannons-shot of <i>Conayou</i>,
he divided his Men into four Parties, that so they might Storm the four Corners
of the Fort at once; which having done by swimming over the Moat, and
climbing up the Walls, which were a Pikes length, they got into the Fort, in which
they found eleven dead Bodies, ten Iron Guns, two Hooks, and several Chests of
Sugar; and amongst other Prisoners they took the Captain <i>Alvares Fragoso d’ Albuquerque</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Stackhower</i> also setting Sail when <i>Arcisseusky</i> left the Castle <i>Ceulen</i>, intending to
meet him again at an appointed time before <i>Conayou</i>, was kept back by contrary
Winds.</p>

<p class='c010'>After this <i>Arcisseusky</i> set Sail to <i>Mongoangape</i>, where Rowing up the River, he
took a Ketch with two hundred Chests of Sugar, as also a Carvel and a Boat, and
Landed where the River bends about a Mountain, which so affrighted the <i>Portuguese</i>,
that they quitted <i>Antonio Marino</i>’s Sugar-Mills. Soon after the Fleet took a
Barque with Wine, and return’d to <i>Reciffa</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mean while <i>Schuppe</i> was not idle, for going up the River <i>Camarigibi</i>, he burnt divers
Houses, as also on each side of the River <i>Alagoa</i>; where he also took four rich
Sugar-Mills, whilest many Vessels from the <i>United Netherlands</i> brought several Ships
into the Haven of <i>Pernambuco</i>, which they had taken on the Coast of <i>Brasile</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fort <i>Santa Margareta</i> attempted by the <i>Hollanders</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>About the latter end of <i>November</i> 1634. thirty two Sail, divided into two Squadrons
(the first carrying in one and twenty Ships, a thousand nine hundred forty and
five Soldiers, the second on eleven Ketches, four hundred and nine) under the Command
of <i>Schuppe</i>, <i>Arcisseusky</i>, <i>Carpentier</i>, and <i>Stackhower</i>, weigh’d Anchor to go to <i>Parayba</i>;
where <i>Schuppe</i> Landing first with six hundred Men, fell upon the Enemy in
such a manner, that he put them to flight, and forc’d them to leave a great part of
their Arms, Hats and Coats behind; and it wanted little but the Governor <i>Antonio
d’ Albuquerque</i> had been taken in the pursuit: Mean while the rest of the <i>Hollanders</i>
Landed, and <i>Casper Ley</i> march’d along a Cart-Road with three Companies directly
to the Fort <i>Santa Margareta</i>, and Encamp’d himself behind a Hill, about a Musquet-shot
from the Walls of the Fort: <i>Schuppe</i> going along the Shore, found divers forsaken
Works, and Intrench’d along the River on the East-side of the Castle. <i>Arcisseusky</i>
march’d on the Right-hand along the Sea-shore in view of the <i>Portuguese</i> in
Garrison. In the River lay an Isle, on which was built the Castle <i>Restinga</i>, which
could receive constant Aid from the Castle <i>Margareta</i> on the Main.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fort <i>Margareta</i> taken by <i>Schuppe</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fort <i>Antonio</i> taken by <i>Lichthart</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Lichthart</i> going in between the Island and the Castle <i>Margareta</i> with six well
Mann’d Boats, took two Barques and a Boat behind the Island, and march’d
through a Wood to <i>Restringa</i>; where he found that the Fort separated from the
Island, was surrounded with Water, wherefore he withdrew into the Wood till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>the Water was fall’n down, and then Storm’d the Fort <i>Restringa</i>, and notwithstanding
the <i>Portuguese</i> fir’d continually upon him with two Brass Guns, he soon
became Master of it, and cut off all those whom he found had born Arms; whilest
<i>Schuppe</i> fir’d upon the Fort <i>Margareta</i> from a Platform, and also threw Granado’s into
the same. <i>Arcisseusky</i> likewise approach’d nearer and nearer with his Trenches,
on which the <i>Portuguese</i> discharged many Guns; but after the Breastworks were
most of them spoil’d, the Governor, <i>Simon de Albuquerque</i>, surrendred the Fort to
<i>Schuppe</i>, who permitted a hundred and fifty Men that were in Garrison there, to go
to their several Dwellings up in the Countrey, the rest were Transported to other
places, on promise that they would not bear Arms against the <i>West-India</i> Company
during the space of six Moneths. In the Castle the <i>Hollanders</i> found six Brass Demi-Culverins
and fifteen Drakes, besides other Ammunition, with which the Victors
pursu’d their Conquest, putting themselves in a posture to go up a Creek which
runs two Leagues along a River to <i>Parayba</i>, and to fall upon that City, when two
<i>French</i> Renegado’s coming from the <i>Northern</i> Fort <i>Antonio</i> brought information,
That that Fort was guarded but by a few Men, and had but little Gun-powder, and
if the <i>Hollanders</i> would but once make a shew of Storming the same, it would soon
be deliver’d to them, though for its Situation it is invincible; but <i>Schuppe</i> suppos’d
that there might be a Plot in this Information, and the rather, because he heard
that the Duke of <i>Bagnola</i> was coming thither with six hundred Men; nevertheless,
to be better assur’d thereof, he sent a Drummer to demand <i>Antonio</i>: The Governor
thereof, call’d <i>Magaglianes</i> desir’d three days time to consider, which was utterly
deny’d him, and he had onely leave to carry away the King’s Standard, and his
Request granted, That the <i>Hollanders</i> should make a shew of Storming the Castle,
that it might not be said he had surrendred such a Fortress without a Gun being fir’d;
after which <i>Lichthart</i> went into the Castle, wondring at such a Victory; for the
Fort, on which no Charges had been spar’d, lay upon an inaccessible place, and had
five Brass Culverins and nineteen Iron Guns.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The City <i>Parayba</i> deserted by <i>Bagnola</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Hollanders</i> encourag’d by their good Success, went the same Night up the
River <i>Parayba</i> to the Creek <i>Tambia Grande</i>; where Landing, they found all the
Works empty, three Iron Guns lying dismounted on the Ground, the City <i>Parayba</i>
without People, and the Guns about the same either made useless, or sunk in the
Haven. A <i>Hamburgher</i> that had liv’d a considerable time in <i>Parayba</i>, otherwise call’d
<i>Philippea</i>, inform’d the <i>Hollanders</i>, That <i>Bagnola</i> seeing no means to defend <i>Parayba</i>,
was gone to <i>Goyana</i> with two Companies, one of <i>Italians</i>, and the other <i>Spaniards</i>,
who were march’d into the Woods, after they had burnt three Ships, and two
Store-houses full of Sugar, in which there were consum’d near upon three hundred
Chests.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before this Design upon <i>Parayba</i> was undertaken, the <i>West-India</i> Company sent
out four Vessels under the Command of <i>John Walbeek</i>, to the Isle <i>Curacao</i>; the Situation
of which <i>John Otzon</i> knew exactly, having been a long time a Prisoner there:
<i>Walbeek</i> getting through a narrow Mouth between several Rocks into a convenient
Harbor before <i>Curacao</i>, Landed seventy five Musquetteers who were Encountred
by seventy <i>Brasilians</i> Arm’d with Clubs, which the <i>Spaniards</i> had animated to fight,
by making them half Drunk. The <i>Hollanders</i> having march’d all over the Island,
burnt the Village <i>Maria</i>, and at last agreed with the Governor <i>Alonso Lopes de Morla</i>
to leave the Isle.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Schuppe</i> chang’d the Name of <i>Parayba</i>, or <i>Nossa Sennora das Nieves</i>, or <i>Philippea</i>, into
<i>Frederick-Stadt</i>, in honor to the Prince of <i>Orange</i>, nam’d <i>Frederick Henrick</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Parayba</i>, or <i>Henrick-stadt</i> describ’d.</div>

<p class='c010'>This City hath two great Market-places, twelve Streets, and a large <i>Franciscan</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_553'>553</span>Cloyster, built near a Lake, and inclos’d within a Wall by a broad Bay, which the
River <i>Parayba</i> makes before the City; the Countrey about which is mountainous:
In other places, especially along the River, lie many fruitful Plains, abounding
in some places with the Grain <i>Mandihoca</i>, which is ground to Meal, Potato’s, Lemmons,
Cabbages, Cucumbers, <i>Bananas</i>, <i>Cocoa</i>-Nuts, Ginger, <i>Araba</i>, very delicious
when Preserv’d with Sugar, and <i>Cacious</i>, somewhat like Chesnuts, of which the
Natives make an intoxicating Liquor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whilest all things were put in good order at <i>Parayba</i>, Colonel <i>Picard</i> march’d
with eight Companies to the House <i>Validaris</i>, if possible, there to take the Governor
<i>Antonio Albuquerque</i> Prisoner; but he being forsaken by all the <i>Brasilians</i> (who came
back with <i>Picard</i> and their Commander, the Jesuit <i>Emanuel de Morais</i>) absconded
himself; not long before which a Proclamation had been publish’d in the Name
of the <i>States</i> of the <i>United Netherlands</i> and the <i>West-India</i> Company, promising great
Civilities and Advantages to all the Inhabitants of <i>Parayba</i>, whether Natives or
others, that would come in and submit to their Government.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Invitation was so well receiv’d, that many who were kept back so long as
<i>Albuquerque</i> appear’d, as soon as they heard of his obscuring himself, came in to the
<i>Hollanders</i>, as <i>Duarte Gomes</i>, and several eminent <i>Portugueses</i>, with a considerable
number of indifferent quality; as also the Inhabitants of the Province of <i>Rio Grande</i>
came to <i>Frederick-Stadt</i>, to claim the benefit of the Proclamation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Rebellino</i> forced to flye from place to place.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Arcisseusky</i> and <i>Stackhower</i> marching to <i>Goyana</i> with seven hundred and fifty Men,
took up their Quarters in the Village <i>Capivaribi</i>, lying at a River of the same Name;
where all the Inhabitants of <i>Goyana</i> being fully satisfi’d with the <i>Hollanders</i> Proposals,
own’d their Government, and fell off from the King of <i>Spain</i>. But the <i>Spanish</i>
Captain <i>Rebellino</i>, animated by the <i>Jesuits</i> in the Village <i>Mosuick</i>, got three hundred
Soldiers together, besides a considerable company of <i>Brasilians</i>, Commanded by
<i>Camaron</i>, and burnt all the Sugar-Canes and <i>Brasile</i> Wood in <i>Goyana</i>; whither <i>Arcisseusky</i>
marching, soon put them to flight, and burnt the Village <i>Mosuick</i>, with the
Church and <i>Jesuits</i> Cloyster, from whence the Enemy ran to the strange Mountain
<i>Miritbi</i>, which in the rainy Season, especially when great Showers fall, makes a
noise like claps of Thunder, or like great Guns. The same Wonder is observ’d of
the Mountain <i>Pasayra</i>, in a Wood behind <i>Girgolio Barro</i>’s Sugar-Mills; the mystery
whereof we leave to Philosophers to enquire into. <i>Arcisseusky</i> follow’d <i>Rebellino</i>,
who had ambuscado’d himself about half a League from  <i>Mosuick</i>; from whence he
being also driven, his Men began more and more to desert him, whilest <i>Schuppe</i>
with a considerable number of Men came to <i>Arcisseusky</i>; Encamping themselves
about <i>Musarope</i>, they sent eighty Musquetteers, Commanded by Lieutenant <i>Metting</i>,
to an adjacent Wood, where <i>Rebellino</i> Quartering, Engag’d with <i>Metting</i>, till <i>Schuppe</i>
coming to his assistance, he fled to <i>Nazaretta</i>. After which the Countrey thereabouts
enjoy’d the happiness of Peace.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Castle <i>Real</i> taken by <i>Arcisseusky</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Arcisseusky</i> staying to settle all things in good order in <i>Parayba</i>, took up his Quarters
near the Castle <i>Real</i>, about a Cannon-shot from the River <i>Afogados</i>, and a
League and a half from the <i>Hollanders</i> Fort so call’d; yet his Design was not to lay
close Siege to the same, but to prevent all manner of Aid from coming to it, the
rather, because he was inform’d, that there were not above sixty six hundred Cans
of Meal, and sixty five Head of Cattel in the Fort, for three hundred <i>Portuguese</i> and
seven hundred <i>Brasilians</i>; to which purpose he built several Redoubts, Batteries
and Platforms: after he had lay’n before it three Moneths it was surrendred upon
these following Articles, <i>viz.</i> “That the Besieged should march out with lighted
Matches, Bullets in their Mouths, flying Colours, and with Bag and Baggage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>and be Transported either to <i>Tercera</i> or <i>Madera</i>.” The Church Ornaments they
had also leave to carry away with them, but the Guns and other Ammunition were
to remain in the Fort. Hereupon the Governor <i>Andreas Marini</i> march’d out with
five hundred choice Soldiers, besides a hundred and fifty which he had out of the
Countrey; and two hundred Families that dwelt about <i>Real</i>, ransom’d their Goods
for 5000 <i>l.</i> In the Fort the <i>Hollanders</i> found fifteen Brass, and five Iron Guns.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mean while <i>Lichthart</i> set Sail with six Ships and five little Ketches, carrying five
Companies; with which Landing on <i>Barra Grande</i>, he march’d two Leagues along
the Shore to the Church of <i>St. Bento</i>, built on a high Hill, round about which he
Encamp’d himself, and fortifi’d the same with Pallisado’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hither the Inhabitants of <i>Porto Calvo</i> came in great numbers to take the Oath of
Allegiance to the <i>West-India</i> Company.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Bagnola</i> routed by <i>Lichthart</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Lichthart</i> assisted by Captain <i>Cornelis Exel</i>’s Company, march’d directly to <i>Porto
Calvo</i>, notwithstanding he had but three hundred and twenty seven Men, with which
he went along a troublesom Way, up Hill and down Hill, and coming near
<i>Porto Calvo</i>, was inform’d by a <i>Portuguese</i>, That the Duke <i>Bagnola</i> possess’d a Church
there full of Port-holes, with two hundred choice Men, besides a Company newly
arriv’d there from <i>Serinhain</i>; and that he had a strong Fortification near the River;
nevertheless <i>Lichthart</i> marching towards him, discover’d his Forces rank’d on a
steep Mountain, whither he running with his Men, forc’d <i>Bagnola</i> to quit the Church,
as also those that lay in Ambuscade near the High-way, whilest eighty <i>Brasilians</i>,
some <i>Portugueses</i>, and a Company of <i>Neopolitans</i>, thought to have fall’n upon the
Barques of the <i>Hollanders</i>, but seeing the <i>States</i> Flag upon the Church, and <i>Bagnola</i>
routed, they soon Retreated. This Victory cost the <i>Hollanders</i> but seven Men, besides
eighteen wounded; for which the <i>Portuguese</i> lost many more.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Inhabitants of <i>Camarigibi</i>, <i>Antonio</i>, and about <i>Porto Calvo</i>, accepting of the
Articles propos’d in <i>Parayba</i>, took the Oath of Allegiance to the <i>Hollanders</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the interim after <i>Arcisseusky</i> had taken the Fort <i>Real</i>, and given Command
thereof to <i>Verdoes</i>, he set forth with ten Companies and three hundred <i>Brasilians</i>,
to joyn with <i>Schuppe</i>, who Besieg’d the Fort <i>Nazaretta</i> near the Promontory <i>St. Augustine</i>;
but the Governor <i>Albuquerque</i> fearing he should be surpris’d, fled from thence
with three hundred Men, and left <i>Peter Correa de Gamba</i>, and <i>Lewis Barbalho Bizerra</i>
in his stead. But <i>Schuppe</i> approach’d so near with his Trenches and Granado’s, that
<i>Correa</i> inform’d of <i>Arcisseusky</i>’s coming, surrendred the Castle upon advantageous
Articles.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Porto Calvo</i> surpris’d by <i>Albuquerque</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>After this Success <i>Schuppe</i> march’d along the Shore, and <i>Arcisseusky</i> up into the
Countrey, both with intention to fall upon the Enemy in <i>Serinhain</i>. <i>Arcisseusky</i>
marching along a troublesom Way, came to <i>Miguel de Poyaca</i> with six Companies,
where the Councellor <i>Schotte</i> had fortifi’d a Church; and somewhat farther he met
with a brave <i>Franciscan</i> Cloyster, where he was inform’d, that the Governor <i>Albuquerque</i>
had again surpris’d the Fort <i>Porto Calvo</i>; which prov’d too true; for <i>Schuppe</i>
hastening to his assistance through <i>Serinhain</i>, <i>Una</i>, and <i>Barro</i>, staid at <i>Furicoso</i>, a League
from <i>Porto Calvo</i>, for <i>Arcisseusky</i>, who was coming thither with seven Companies
over the deep and crooked Stream <i>Serinhain</i>; and before <i>Villa Foamosa</i>, a pleasant Village,
in which stood an old <i>Jesuits</i> Cloyster and a little Church, both their Forces
joyn’d together, making up seventeen Companies of Foot, and one Troop of Horse;
but they came too late: for after a long and stout Assault, and no less Resistance
from the Besieged, the Place was surrendred to <i>Albuquerque</i>, who caus’d <i>Domingo
Calabar</i> to be Quarter’d; a Man not inferior for Strength and Activity to that <i>Milo
Crotoniates</i>, so famous amongst the ancient <i>Grecians</i>: Amongst other proofs of his
Strength it is related, that he took a Stag running full speed by the Horns, and turning
its Neck, pull’d the Tongue out of its Mouth. The reason why <i>Albuquerque</i>
caus’d him to be put to that death, was because he had once joyn’d with the <i>Hollanders</i>,
and done the <i>Portuguese</i> much hurt. But <i>Schuppe</i> and <i>Arcisseusky</i> marching
to <i>Porto Calvo</i>, to Engage with <i>Albuquerque</i>, who was eight hundred <i>Portuguese</i> and a
thousand <i>Brasilians</i> strong, found the Place ruin’d, and about a hundred <i>Hollanders</i>
unbury’d, and <i>Albuquerque</i> march’d away, driving the Inhabitants about <i>Porto Calvo</i>
before him, with three hundred Prisoners: The <i>Hollanders</i> following him, built a
Fort at <i>Praipuera</i>, to prevent the <i>Portuguese</i> from returning to <i>Porto Calvo</i>. <i>Schuppe</i>
also demanded three Companies more to supply the places of the sick and slain
Men, as also those who were so miserably plagued by the <i>Bicios</i>, that they were not
able to go. These <i>Bicios</i> are little Animals, which creeping in at the Pores, cause
an insufferable pain. <i>Schuppe</i>’s Request was the sooner granted, because the Councel
at <i>Reciffa</i> judg’d it convenient to pull down the Forts <i>Real</i> and <i>Nazaretta</i>, being
already much decay’d and unserviceable, and that those who were in Garrison in
them, should Encamp in the Fields. <i>Schuppe</i> had long before this time fall’n upon
the Enemy in the <i>Afogados</i>, but that he wanted Provisions, and little Vessels, which
were requir’d for that Expedition. But marching up into the Countrey, he left
the Command to <i>Arcisseusky</i>, who much forwarded the building of the Fort on
<i>Paripuera</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A great Fleet of <i>Spaniards</i> appears before <i>Reciffa</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_555'>555</span>The Year 1635. being almost expir’d, one Morning about Day-break thirty two
Sail were seen to Steer directly towards <i>Reciffa</i>; two Ships of an extraordinary
bigness were follow’d by nine Gallions, and these by the rest of the Fleet, consisting
of Pinks, Carvels, and Barques; all which approaching, were known to be
<i>Spaniards</i>, which struck no small amazement to the Inhabitants of <i>Reciffa</i>, most of
their Ships being Cruising abroad before the Coast of <i>Brasile</i> and their Men a great
distance off in the Field; onely five Ships fitted for an Engagement being at Anchor,
and five more deeply laden: Mean while the <i>Spanish</i> Admiral approach’d
within a Cannon-shot of the <i>Fame</i> Ketch, discharg’d one Gun, and stood off to Sea
again, being inform’d that <i>Real</i> and <i>Nazaretta</i> were taken by the <i>Hollanders</i>. On the
other side, all the Places in their possession had notice of this Fleet, which <i>Lichthart</i>
follow’d with six Ships and two Ketches, carrying two Companies of Soldiers, besides
Seamen, and keeping just within sight of them, saw them at last come to an
Anchor before <i>Paripuera</i> (where a part of the <i>Dutch</i> Forces lay under the Command
of <i>Arcisseusky</i>,) and make preparation to Land their Men: Whereupon <i>Lichthart</i>
Landed also, with the Councellor <i>Carpentier</i>, and joyning with <i>Arcisseusky</i>, took up
a valiant Resolution, to Sail close up to the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet with his eight Ships, whilest
<i>Arcisseusky</i> march’d in the Night with six hundred Men to <i>Jaragoa</i>, to prevent the
Enemy’s Landing; but having a <i>Portuguese</i> for his Guide, was led a wrong Way;
wherefore returning, he secur’d the Way to <i>Paripuera</i>, whilest the <i>Portuguese</i> Inhabitants,
contrary to their Oath, refused to carry or bring Provisions to the <i>Dutch</i>
Forces, and joyning together combin’d with the <i>Spanish</i> Seamen, and kill’d all the
<i>Hollanders</i> which they could meet either on the High-ways, or in their Houses, making
use of the <i>Negro</i>’s to carry the <i>Spaniards</i> what Intelligence they could give them
of the <i>Hollanders</i> Proceedings: Wherefore they thought it the best way to be rid
of such Villains, to destroy them all that dwelt in the Countrey between <i>Paripuera</i>
and <i>Porto Calvo</i>, and for the space of ten Leagues burnt all their Sugar-Canes in the
Fields, their Mills and Houses. <i>Arcisseusky</i> caus’d Edicts to be put upon every Church
Door, That all the Inhabitants should remove from <i>Porto Calvo</i>, where the <i>Dutch</i>
Army was to Encamp, to keep them from the <i>Spanish</i> Oppression.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_556'>556</span>That Summer having been so dry, that no man ever remembred the like, had
dry’d up all the Morasses, so that the <i>Spaniards</i> marching over them and high Mountains,
got a back Way into the Countrey. In the mean time <i>John Walbeck</i> made a
Fort with five Bulwarks on the Island <i>Curacao</i>, near the Haven <i>Santa Cruz</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Houte-been</i> taken by <i>Dunkirkers</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Houte-been</i> also ran with two Ketches, the <i>Otter</i> and <i>Brack</i>, to Anchor before <i>Curacao</i>,
and from thence to the Haven <i>St. Jago de Cuba</i>, where the Watch made no Alarm,
because he carry’d <i>Burgundy</i> Colours, by which also several others, both <i>Portuguese</i>
and <i>Spaniards</i> were deceiv’d. Not long after he burnt one Barque with <i>Tortoises</i>,
sunk another, and set a third a Drift; after which having refresh’d at <i>Jamaica</i>, he
Engag’d with several <i>Spanish</i> Men of War and took them, besides a great number
of Prizes, in one of which he found such abundance of Copper, Indigo, Money,
<i>Canaster</i>, Tobacco, and Piece-Goods, that the two Ketches were not able to load the
same; but at last Steering for <i>Holland</i>, he was set upon by seven <i>Dunkirkers</i>, Commanded
by <i>Colaert</i>, and after long and stout resistance was taken.</p>

<p class='c010'>Captain <i>Abraham Roosendael</i> setting Sail from the <i>Texel</i>, met with a Frigat carrying
forty six Chests full of <i>Ryals of Eight</i>, being in number eighty six thousand, design’d
to pay the Forces at <i>Porto Rico</i>; besides a quantity of Plate, which amounted
to a considerable sum of Money; with all which he arriv’d safe in his desired
Port.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Arcisseusky</i> fortifi’d himself along the crooked River <i>Paripuera</i>, full of Crocodiles,
which hurt none, unless provok’d. This River runs five Leagues to the Northward
of <i>Punta de Jaragoa</i>, where the <i>Spanish</i> Forces Landed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Southward from <i>Jaragoa</i> lie the <i>Alagoas del Nort</i> and <i>Zul</i>, distinguish’d by a high
Tract of Land; where the <i>Spanish</i> General <i>Lewis Rochas Borgia</i> left his Guns and a
thousand Men, under the Command of the Duke <i>Bagnola</i>, whilest with three times
as many more he went to <i>Porto Calvo</i> to be there before the time which the <i>Hollanders</i>
had in their Edicts set the Inhabitants for their removal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Borgia</i>’s Army defeated by <i>Arcisseusky</i> and himself slain.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_557'>557</span><i>Arcisseusky</i> had by this time built on the North part of the Mouth of <i>Paripuera</i> a
Redoubt like a Castle, out of the middle whereof rose a woodden Tower, fill’d
with Earth, and secur’d by a Half-Moon; on one side whereof he lay Encamp’d
with fifteen Companies. On the South side of the River stood also two strong
Forts. <i>Arcisseusky</i> having not the least thought that <i>Borgia</i> would come over the
Mountains, and through inaccessible Woods and Morasses, a back Way into <i>Porto
Calvo</i>, receiv’d news on the thirteenth of <i>January</i> 1636. by a Renegade <i>Negro</i>, that
the <i>Spanish</i> Army, consisting of three thousand Men, were come to <i>Rodrigo de Barros</i>
his Sugar-Mills, about five Leagues from <i>Paripuera</i>, and was suddenly expected
to fall upon Colonel <i>Schuppe</i> in <i>Porto Calvo</i>; whereupon <i>Arcisseusky</i> immediately set
forth with twelve hundred Men and two Field-pieces, burnt all the Houses, Sugar-Mills
and Canes he could meet with. Mean while <i>Borgia</i> (upon whose Approach
<i>Schuppe</i> had left <i>Porto Calvo</i>) observing by the Smoak in the Countrey, that <i>Arcisseusky</i>
had put his Edicts in Execution, leaving a considerable Garrison in <i>Porto Calvo</i>,
went to meet <i>Arcisseusky</i> with the choicest Men. <i>Arcisseusky</i> being got between <i>Camarigibi</i>
and <i>Porto Calvo</i>, without having any notice of the Enemy’s being so near,
and his Forlorn being unawares Engag’d, and running back in great disorder,
drew up his Men into a posture of Defence about a Musquet-shot from the Enemy;
but the darkness of the Night made a great confusion in both Armies, being
as it were mingled pell-mell one with another. <i>Arcisseusky</i> was much inferior in
number to the <i>Spaniards</i>, but considering it was impossible to march back, in regard
the Enemy was as well behind them as before, and that thousands of <i>Brasilians</i> lay
watching for them in the Woods, in case they should be dispers’d, he saw there
was no way but to stand to the hazard of Battel. About Day-break both Armies
stood an hour looking upon one another; the place where they stood being
surrounded with Woods and deep Valleys. <i>Borgia</i> drew out his Men on a Hill,
overgrown with Bushes. <i>Arcisseusky</i> had drawn out his Men on somewhat a lower
Ground. <i>Borgia</i> at last sent some of his Musquetteers down the Hill, who fir’d with
a full Volley upon the <i>Dutch</i>, whilest <i>Arcisseusky</i> onely discharg’d a Field-piece at a
Tree, under which <i>Borgia</i> stood to take a view of the <i>Hollanders</i> Forces; upon the
firing of which Gun <i>Borgia</i> began to come down the Hill with all his Army, against
whom <i>Arcisseusky</i> drew out his first and second Division, whilest Captain <i>Vanden
Brande</i> led his Companies within two Pikes length from the Enemy, before he discharg’d,
which was no sooner done, but contrary to Order they broke into the left
Wing of <i>Borgia</i>’s Army, and put his Musquetteers to flight, who were soon follow’d
by the whole <i>Spanish</i> Army, some running into the Woods, others into the
Morasses, but most of them along the narrow Way which leads to <i>Porto Calvo</i>. Among
the Slain was <i>Borgia</i> himself, who was Descended from the greatest Families of the
Dukes of <i>Lerma</i> and <i>Borgia</i>; he was about forty eight years of Age, and had serv’d
the <i>Spanish</i> King a considerable time in the <i>Netherlands</i>. This Victory cost the <i>Hollanders</i>
about forty Men, besides as many more wounded. Amongst the <i>Spanish</i> Prisoners
was a <i>Neapolitan</i> Gentleman, call’d <i>Hector de la Calce</i>, who upon Examination
inform’d the <i>Hollanders</i>, That with the last <i>Spanish</i> Fleet there Landed two thousand
four hundred Men in <i>Alagoa</i>, with twenty Brass Field-pieces, abundance of Wheelbarrows,
Spades and Pick-axes, which cost in <i>Portugal</i> eight hundred thousand <i>Crusado</i>’s;
with which great warlike Preparations <i>Borgia</i> made no doubt to have got
fast footing in the Countrey, and to have cut off all manner of Assistance from the
<i>Hollanders</i>; That the <i>Spanish</i> King rais’d a great many Men both in <i>Spain</i>, <i>Italy</i>, and
<i>Germany</i>, that with the first opportunity he might fit out a Fleet, which was to be
conducted by four thousand two hundred Seamen, to whom the <i>Castilians</i> were to
add eight thousand five hundred Soldiers and two hundred Seamen, and the <i>Portuguese</i>
the like number, to serve ashore, and to drive all Strangers out of <i>Brasile</i>;
That this Design had long since been put in Execution, had not the <i>Albuquerquers</i>
continually deceiv’d the King of <i>Spain</i>, under pretence that <i>Brasile</i> was in no danger;
That <i>Albuquerque</i> would be forc’d to resign up the Interest which he had in <i>Brasile</i>,
for which the King would give him a Dukedom in <i>Portugal</i> in exchange.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Schuppe</i> and <i>Arcisseusky</i> judging it no way convenient to fall upon the Enemy in
<i>Porto Calvo</i>, Garrison’d <i>Paripuera</i> with four hundred Men, under the Command of
the Captains <i>Day</i> and <i>Philip Andrews</i>, whom they furnish’d with Provisions for five
Moneths, and left Order to defend the Countrey against the Incursions of the Enemy;
which done, they went aboard with eleven hundred Men, and took in two
Companies of <i>Brasilians</i> at <i>Barra Grande</i>; with whom Landing behind the Isle <i>Alexio</i>,
they came to <i>Serinhain</i> before Day-light, and found all the Inhabitants fled into the
Woods, fearing they would take Revenge on them for murdering of their Sick
which they had left there. They were no sooner Encamp’d here, but they receiv’d
Information from <i>John Talibon</i>, that the <i>Spanish</i> Army intended to Besiege the Redoubt
in <i>Barra Grande</i>, which therefore, as lying on an ill place, and not able to resist
long, they flighted: After which being furnish’d with Provisions out of some
Ketches Commanded by the Admiral <i>Lichthart</i>, they return’d, with Intentions to
take up their Quarters in <i>Serinhain</i> during the Winter Season, whilest the Enemy
lay in <i>Cockau</i>, on one side of <i>Una</i> and <i>Serinhain</i>, and kept private Correspondence
with some of the <i>Portuguese</i> that had taken the Oath of Allegiance to the <i>Hollanders</i>;
but <i>Arcisseusky</i> fell so fiercely upon them, that they all fled to <i>Porto Calvo</i>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_558'>558</span>took three Monks Prisoners, who had been the chief Authors of this private Correspondence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Soon after twenty eight Ships arriving at <i>Reciffa</i>, brought fresh Supplies of Men
thither from the <i>Maes</i> and <i>Zealand</i>, with Ammunition and Provisions, which was
much wanted; also two Councellors, <i>Henrick Schild</i> and <i>Paulus Serooskerken</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Fleet was scarce got in, when in the Evening news was brought, that
eight hundred <i>Spaniards</i> were broke in through <i>Poyuca</i>, and had taken <i>John Paez
Baretto</i>’s Sugar-Mill, and destroy’d all they came at; but that the <i>Hollanders</i> defending
the Church with great Valor, obtain’d Quarter upon the surrendring of it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Spaniards</i> under <i>Rebellino</i> routed by <i>Stackhower</i> and <i>Litchthart</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>This raging Army, led by Colonel <i>Rebellino</i> and <i>Madurera</i>, march’d to <i>Laurenzo</i>
and <i>Massiapi</i>, whither there resorted daily more Men to them, which put the Council
at <i>Reciffa</i> to a great Dilemma, foreseeing, that if they should send for <i>Schuppe</i>
from <i>Serinhain</i>, the Enemy from <i>Una</i> and <i>Porto Calvo</i> would hem him in, neither had
they sufficient Forces to withstand <i>Rebellino</i>; therefore it was judg’d convenient to
send to <i>Arcisseusky</i> to joyn with <i>Schuppe</i>’s Army, that they might both unawares fall
upon the Enemy. In the interim a hundred and twenty <i>Tapuyans</i>, sent by <i>Janduy</i>,
came to <i>Reciffa</i>, with information that <i>Janduy</i> was coming himself, with several
other neighboring Kings, to their Assistance. <i>Schuppe</i>, according to the
Councels Order, march’d in the Night through the Sugar-Mills of <i>Rio Formoso</i>,
rested the next day in the Valley <i>Orekinda</i>, and guarded all the Avenues: Whilest
he went about to Storm the Village <i>Una</i>, <i>Mansveld</i> was to Engage with a hundred
<i>Spaniards</i> on one side of <i>Iletta</i>’s Sugar-Mills, and <i>Arcisseusky</i> was to fall upon the
Village; whither marching early in the Morning, they saw onely a few of the
Inhabitants, the Enemy being gone with his Forces over to <i>Manbucava</i>, nor could
they pass any farther, finding the River too deep to wade through: But it had
like to have gone worse with <i>Stackhower</i> and <i>Litchthart</i>, who with <i>Maulpas</i> making
twelve hundred Men, were surpris’d by <i>Rebellino</i>, rushing forth of an Ambuscade
near <i>Laurenzo</i>, where <i>Maulpas</i> receiving a Wound dy’d of the same. This rough Entertainment
at first much daunted the <i>Hollanders</i>; but regaining their Courage, they
press’d upon the <i>Spanish</i> Army in such a manner, that <i>Rebellino</i> being wounded in
his Shoulder, fled in great disorder through the Sugar-Fields to <i>Porto Calvo</i>, and of
fifteen hundred Men sav’d not above four hundred, the rest being either kill’d, or
scatter’d up and down the Countrey; twelve taken <i>Hollanders</i> were also released by
this means. The <i>Portuguese</i> Design on <i>Paripuera</i> also succeeded not much better.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cameron</i> put to flight by <i>Arcisseusky</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Arcisseusky</i> receiving Letters of Advice from the Councellor <i>Serooskerken</i>, that
<i>Camaron</i> lay Encamp’d with fifteen hundred Men about the Fortress <i>Capavaribi</i> in
<i>Goyana</i>, and that the Besieged could not hold out above four days longer, and that
the Enemy had also taken two Barques full of Provisions and Ammunition, sent
thither to relieve the Besieged, march’d with excessive toyl through uncouth and intricate
Ways, which were rendred unpassable by the great Rains that had lately
fall’n, and came about an hour after Sun-set to <i>Capavaribi</i>; from whence <i>Camaron</i> being
fled two hours before, had left Ammunition in three Carriages, secur’d from
small Shot by thick Planks, which were drawn close under the Walls; also a <i>Burgundian</i>
Flag, two Field-pieces, and two Barques which he had taken with Provisions.
The Enemy fled to <i>Tapiserica</i>, and from thence to <i>Terra Nova</i>. Whilest <i>Arcisseusky</i>
view’d the Works, and his Men stood in good order, great numbers of <i>Brasilians</i>
Sally’d out of the Redoubt, took the Provisions which <i>Camaron</i> had left, spread
themselves up in the Countrey, robb’d the <i>Portuguese</i> Houses, and kill’d the People.
As soon as <i>Arcisseusky</i> had put all things in good order, he left the <i>Brasilians</i>
in <i>Goyana</i> under the Command of the Councellor <i>Eyssens</i>, and pursu’d the fled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_559'>559</span>Enemy, notwithstanding there fell great Showers of Rain, rested a little in the deserted
Village <i>Tapiserica</i>, formerly inhabited by three thousand People, who possess’d
several fair Structures, brave Walks, a large <i>Jesuits</i> Cloyster, and a Church.
The sweet Water and pleasant Pastures invited the <i>Hollanders</i> to stay here a Night.
The next Morning marching forward to <i>Terra Firma</i>, they saw a strong Fortification
newly rais’d, but without People, and heard the Enemy’s Sentinels fire; whereupon
<i>Arcisseusky</i> appointing part of the Army to follow at a distance, march’d before
with the rest, and being fir’d upon from an Ambuscade by <i>Camaron</i>’s Party, he
order’d Captain <i>Talibon</i> to press in upon the Ambuscade; but because it was perform’d
in great disorder, he fell in himself on the right-hand of the Enemy, whilest
<i>Lichthart</i>’s second Division stood still; which so affrighted the Enemy, that without
making the least resistance he fled into the Woods, leaving many dead behind him.
The next day Captain <i>Bohart</i>’s Party tracking the flying Enemy, fell in amongst
them, and gave them a total Rout.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Arcisseusky</i> resolv’d to stay some time in <i>Terra Firma</i> to wait for <i>Camaron</i>, but he
not appearing, he laid waste the Countrey thereabouts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Eyssens</i>: slain in a great Fight with <i>Rebellino</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Rebellino</i> and <i>Lewis de Sosa</i> falling upon the Councellor <i>Eyssens</i>, Governor of <i>Parayba</i>,
routed him, and set fire on the Sugar-Mills belonging to <i>Emanuel Pirez</i>, which
forc’d them with their Swords in their Hands to break through Flame and Smoak
upon the Enemy, who kill’d nine of them upon the Spot (amongst whom <i>Eyssens</i>
and his Secretary) the rest being either taken or fled.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Rebellino</i> put to flight by <i>Arcisseusky</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Immediately after <i>Arcisseusky</i> being inform’d by two Prisoners, that the <i>Spanish</i>
Forces Commanded by <i>Sosa</i>, <i>Dias</i>, and <i>Rebellino</i>, were all joyn’d together in the
Wood <i>Antonio</i>, where <i>Camaron</i> was also expected, he march’d away presently with
half his Army, and as soon as the Captains <i>Metting</i> and <i>Tourlon</i>, whom he commanded
to follow him the next day, were come up to him, he fell upon the Enemy,
who lay on a Hill, at whose Foot was a deep Valley, through which he climb’d
to the top; which valorous Attempt so amaz’d the <i>Spaniards</i>, that without firing a
Gun they fled into the Wood: After which <i>Metting</i> and <i>Tourlon</i> went back to <i>Laurenzo</i>;
and <i>Arcisseusky</i> destroy’d the <i>Rossas</i>, of which the <i>Farinha</i> is made, that so by
scarcity of Provisions he might prevent the Enemy from so often joyning together
in Parties: In the mean time ten Ships from <i>Holland</i> arriv’d with fresh Forces, Ammunition,
Provisions, and two taken Prizes, at <i>Reciffa</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Several Prizes taken by <i>Houte-been</i> after his Releasement.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>An unlucky Accident.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Houte-been</i> being releas’d from his Imprisonment in <i>Dunkirk</i>, set Sail from <i>Holland</i>

Wine out of another before <i>Matanca</i>; after that a <i>Tartan</i> from <i>Havana</i>, two Frigats
with Meal, one full of Wood with two Guns, two Barques carrying <i>Bananas</i>, a rich
laden Pink, two Ships with Hides, and one with Sugar. Near the Island <i>Baru</i> he
heard several great Guns shoot off, whereupon making thither, he found the <i>Zealand</i>
Privateer <i>Martman</i> Engag’d with a Ketch carrying ten Brass and six Iron Guns,
which was run ashore; whereupon <i>Houte-been</i> went to his assistance with a well
Mann’d Boat; which the <i>Spaniards</i> seeing, set fire on their Ketch and fled; but the
Flame having onely hurt the Stern, fifty Men were order’d to get her afloat, who
having begun to unlade the Tobacco, and to take out the Brass Guns, the Gun-Room
took fire, and blew up both Men and Goods; of which twenty four being
sadly hurt, dy’d, the rest escaping miraculously. Not long after <i>Houte-been</i> took
a Ship with Hides, fraighted the <i>Alcmaer</i> Pink with his Prizes for the <i>Texel</i>, ran
close by <i>Carthagena</i>, and kept a considerable time in sight of the Plate-Fleet, of which
he carry’d one of the heaviest Sailers away with him; Being thus enrich’d, he return’d

<div class='sidenote'><i>Grave Maurice</i> sent by the <i>United States</i> to govern <i>Brasile</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_560'>560</span>Whilest Businesses were carry’d on after this manner both by Land and Sea in
<i>Brasile</i>, the <i>West-India</i> Company resolv’d to send some Person of Quality thither as
President or supream Governor; and after no long Consultation who should be
the Person, <i>Grave Maurice</i> of <i>Nassaw</i> was pitch’d upon, as being not only eminent for
his Noble Alliance by Marriage to Emperors and Kings, but also for his excellent
skill in Martial Affairs, the proofs whereof were known to all Men, as his
marching to the <i>Paltz</i> against <i>Spinola</i>, his being in the great Siege of <i>Grol</i>, <i>Hertogen-Bosch</i>,
<i>Maestricht</i>, <i>Venlo</i>, <i>Rhynberk</i>, and <i>Schenkenschans</i>, at all which he receiv’d great
Honor; all which consider’d, they made him chief Governor of <i>Brasile</i>, giving him
a Commission Sign’d by the <i>States</i> of the <i>United Netherlands</i> and <i>West-India</i> Company,
to Govern with absolute Power, as well in Civil as Martial Affairs, to the best advantage
of that <i>State</i>. At first they resolv’d to send a Fleet of thirty two Sail thither,
but they afterwards reduc’d that number to twelve, which they Mann’d with
two thousand seven hundred Men. <i>Grave Maurice</i> set Sail on the twenty fifth of
<i>October</i> 1636. onely with four Sail, whereof the Admiral Ship call’d <i>The Zutfen</i>,
carry’d but three hundred and fifty Men: about the <i>Sorlings</i> they met with blustering
Weather, insomuch that the Fleet was forc’d to put in at <i>Falmouth</i>, and after
forty days stay there, weigh’d Anchor, and Steer’d for <i>Cape Verd</i>, and refresh’d at
the Isle of <i>May</i>, famous for Salt-pans, and inhabited by a few <i>Negro</i>’s, and banish’d
<i>Portugueses</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>He is joyfully receiv’d at <i>Reciffa</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>On the twenty third of <i>January</i> 1637. <i>Grave Maurice</i> arriving at <i>Reciffa</i>, was by
every one receiv’d with great joy; as also <i>Adriaen vander Dussen</i>: and soon after <i>Matthias
van Ceulen</i>, <i>Servaes Carpentier</i>, and <i>John Gysseling</i>, were chosen to be of his Privy
Council; whose first Work was exactly to know their Forces, which were either
Inhabitants that were to guard Towns and Fortresses, or Soldiers that march’d into
the Field, two thousand six hundred whereof were appointed to defend <i>Reciffa</i>,
the <i>Afogados</i>, the Promontory <i>St. Augustine</i>, <i>Tamarica</i>, and <i>Parayba</i>: the greatest
Party, which lay in the Field, consisted of two thousand nine hundred Men, and
another lesser Party of six hundred; which last flying Regiment was to be continually
employ’d to make work for the Enemy. They also took an Account of what
Provision and Ammunition they had in store, and found that there was want of
both, especially of Match. Next he enquir’d after the Enemy’s Condition and
Power.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>He marches against the <i>Portugueses</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Povacon</i> taken by the <i>Hollanders</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>From <i>Porto Calvo</i> the <i>Portuguese</i> made continual Sallies out into the Countrey,
which they spoil’d and pillag’d, insomuch that the <i>Brasilians</i> being oppress’d by
them, deserted their Villages, and came for refuge to the <i>Hollanders</i>. The Garrison
in <i>Serinhain</i> was also much too weak to withstand the Incursions of the Enemy, the
rather, because the <i>Portuguese</i> came along private, and to the <i>Hollanders</i> unknown
Ways. All which <i>Grave Maurice</i> considering, caus’d a Fast-day to be proclaim’d, on
which they desir’d Gods assistance in the carrying on of their Designs. After which
he march’d with the Army to <i>Serinhain</i>, from thence cross the River <i>Una</i> to <i>Barra
Grande</i>, and thence to meet with <i>Bagnola</i>, who though he was four thousand Men
strong, besides <i>Negro</i>’s and <i>Brasilians</i>, had stopt up all the Ways with fell’d Trees,
and fortifi’d others. On a Mountain, a League from <i>Porto Calvo</i>, <i>Bagnola</i> kept his
Station. At the foot of the Mountain flow’d a Brook, whose Shore was overgrown
with Rice and young Trees, before which lay a high Bank; opposite to which
<i>Grave Maurice</i> Encamp’d himself towards the Evening, with intentions to fall upon
him the next Morning, notwithstanding his Army consisted not of above fifteen
hundred Men, of which there were six hundred <i>Brasilians</i>. <i>Grave Maurice</i>’s Guard
marching before were follow’d by <i>Schuppe</i> and <i>Arcisseusky</i>, and they by <i>Lichthart</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_561'>561</span>whose Men were all Seamen; all of them firing their Guns amaz’d the Enemy,
whilest two Companies of <i>Brasilians</i>, and three of <i>Hollanders</i> crept through the overgrown
part on the right-hand of the Mountain, and as many more on the left, fell
unawares upon him; but <i>Maurice</i>’s Guard Engaging with a thousand <i>Portugueses</i>,
ran through the Water up against the Works with such undaunted Courage, that
<i>Bagnola</i> Retreated, leaving four hundred Men slain, besides three Brass Guns, and
a great number of Prisoners; those which escap’d fled to <i>Porto Calvo</i>: But <i>Bagnola</i>
fearing to be Besieged there, left <i>Povacon</i>, which Castle, built on one side of <i>Porto
Calvo</i>, lies twenty five Leagues from <i>Reciffa</i>, on a Plain, partly surrounded with
Mountains and Pastures. The River <i>Porto Calvo</i> runs so crooked, that it almost
surrounds the Castle and Town. The Countrey hereabouts is full of Pools. Two
Forts, each built on a Hill near <i>Povacon</i>, <i>Bagnola</i> had caus’d to be undermin’d and
fill’d up with Gun-powder; but they taking fire, were blown up before the
<i>Hollanders</i> came thither, who found them smoaking, and lying like a heap of Rubbish.
<i>Maurice</i> marching forward, Besieg’d <i>Povacon</i>; and Encamping himself below
the Hill where one of the Forts had stood, he rais’d a Redoubt, and with a
Trench approach’d the Moat. Whilest <i>Schuppe</i> lay along the Town from the
Church, <i>Lichthart</i> made a Battery to the North, and somewhat farther <i>Arcisseusky</i>
another; then firing from four Batteries on <i>Povacon</i>, the Besieged answer’d them
again from their Walls, and on the thirteenth day the Governor <i>Michael Giberton</i>
surrendred the Castle upon honorable Articles: for those in Garrison being <i>Italians</i>,
<i>Portugueses</i>, and <i>Castilians</i>, to the number of five hundred, besides the Wounded
and Sick, were to be Transported to <i>Tercera</i>. <i>Maurice</i> entring the Castle, took two
and twenty Brass, and five Iron Guns, four Mortar-pieces, a great many Bullets,
Matches, Gun-powder, and other Ammunition, this being the King of <i>Spain</i>’s Magazine.</p>

<p class='c010'>Near <i>Moribeca</i>, and before <i>St. Laurenzo</i>, the Enemy receiv’d a shrew’d Repulse by
the flying Regiment, led by <i>Stackhower</i>; but Lieutenant <i>Helmich</i> obtain’d special
Honor herein.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Grave Maurice</i> after these Exploits took Shipping in <i>Barra Grande</i>, at a great Inlet
near <i>Porto Calvo</i>, and Landed again at the Promontory <i>Sergoa</i>, from whence he pursu’d
the Enemy to the River <i>Francisco</i>; the Inhabitants about which desir’d, and obtain’d
free Conduct. <i>Bagnola</i> lay on the other side of the River <i>Francisco</i>, in the
Town <i>Openeda</i>; wherefore <i>Schuppe</i>, who was sent to the <i>Afogados</i> to be near the Enemy,
was afterwards commanded to go to <i>Openeda</i> to secure <i>Grave Maurice</i>’s Passage
over thither; but he coming thither after him, <i>Maurice</i> cross’d to the Shore on which
<i>Openeda</i> lay with Boats, and got great Booty; and the more, because the Natives
had not secur’d any thing, <i>Bagnola</i> assuring them that the Castle <i>Povacon</i> could endure
at least a Siege of four Moneths.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Openeda</i> belong’d properly to the Lord <i>Melchior Albes</i>. Near the Town rose a stonie
Rock out of the deep River <i>Francisco</i>, eighty Foot high; from which Rock there
jutted out like Redoubts five Points, and it was call’d <i>Maurice Castle</i>.  Along the Shore
of the fore-mention’d Stream lay several very pleasant Isles. <i>Bagnola</i> escaping privately
from hence, was follow’d by his Men kneeling on floating pieces of Timber,
which with Sticks they Row’d over to the Northern Shore, notwithstanding
the Stream glides so swift, and is so broad, that a six-pound Bullet cannot be shot
over the same; at the Mouth thereof <i>Maurice</i> built another Castle. A League from
his Camp seven hundred <i>Tapuyans</i> (a great salvage and strong People, whose Language
the <i>Portuguese</i>, <i>Brasilians</i>, and <i>Tapuyans</i> that belong’d to <i>Jandui</i>, could not understand)
had Ambuscado’d themselves, and with signs and motions of their Bodies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_562'>562</span>they gave the <i>Hollanders</i> to understand, that they would kill the <i>Portuguese</i> if they
offer’d to cross the Rivers.</p>

<img src='images/i_656.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Maurice</i> advising <i>Prince Frederick Henrick</i> of his Transactions, desir’d that he
would send over Planters thither, whether they were banish’d <i>Germans</i> or Vagabonds,
out of their Houses of Correction; for without them the fruitful Countrey
of <i>Brasile</i> would render but a slender Account to the <i>West-India</i> Company, nor be
able to prevent the Invasions of the <i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Grave Maurice</i> begins his Government with the making of good Laws.</div>

<p class='c010'>The fruitfulness of this Tract of Land was not inferior to any Countrey in the
whole World, Cattel grazing up and down in Herds of five, six, and seven thousand.
Moreover, <i>Maurice</i> advis’d them about the scarcity of Provisions, without
which they were not able to maintain War. He also setled the Traders in a good
Order, dividing all those free People which bore no Offices, into four Companies,
under Captains, Ensigns, and Lieutenants. The Customs and Tributes were
Farm’d, Marriages were order’d to be perform’d by the <i>Netherland</i> Priests, the Jews
had leave not to Watch on their Sabbath, all manner of Debosheries were strictly
forbid from being acted on the Lords-Day, and Punishments ordain’d for Drunkards
and other Deboshees; several Schools were also erected for Youth, and for
the instruction of the <i>Brasilians</i> in the <i>Christian</i> Religion; and lastly, it was permitted
to any that would, to build in the ruin’d City <i>Olinda</i>, or else to repair those Houses
that were fall’n to ruine.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some of the <i>Portugueses</i> fill’d <i>Maurice</i> his Ears with a Report of the Silver-Mines
at <i>Couhaou</i>, <i>Copaou</i>, <i>Terra Nova</i>, and about <i>Cape St. Augustine</i>; but he not regarding
them, plac’d Sheriffs over the Villages, and Overseers over the Alms-houses and
Hospitals, issuing out Orders also for the delivering of the Provisions, which being
very scarce, every Man had a certain Allowance, that so it might last the longer;
but when in this Distribution the meaner sort began to be scanted, the Peoples
Complaints were such, that an Insurrection was like to ensue, if not carefully and
speedily prevented: whereupon the decay’d and deserted Sugar-Mills of the <i>Portugueses</i>
were put to Sale, and sold some for three, others for six and seven thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_563'>563</span>Pound, insomuch that the <i>West-India</i> Company got above 200000 <i>l.</i> for them all.
Soon after they fortifi’d their Castles and other strong Holds, and broke down
those that were judg’d useless. The <i>Brasilians</i> obtain’d liberty also to inhabit their
Villages and till their Land, that they might make Provision for themselves, and
not oppress the Planters that liv’d near them. The <i>Portuguese</i> that had submitted
themselves to the Government of the <i>Hollanders</i>, had free leave granted them
to exercise the <i>Roman-Catholick</i> Religion, onely they were not to send for any
Priests from <i>St. Salvador</i>, which if they did, they should be dealt with as Plotters
of Murders and Treasons; they had liberty also to re-build their Houses
in <i>Olinda</i>, paying Tribute with the <i>Hollanders</i>: Moreover, they were promis’d that
they should live free from all Oppressions of the <i>Hollanders</i>. There was also order
taken about paying the tenth part of the Sugar and <i>Farinha</i>. The Income also of
Fishing and Fowling, amounted to a considerable sum of Money. And to prevent
deceit in Trade, Measures and Weights were made according to those of <i>Amsterdam</i>.
For the Converting of <i>Pagans</i>, <i>Jews</i>, and <i>Roman</i> Catholicks, able Teachers were sent
into the Countrey to promulgate the Gospel.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

</div>

<p class='c010'>About this time there went a Report, as if the <i>West-India</i> Company were inclin’d
to remove their Seat from <i>Reciffa</i> to the Island <i>Tamarica</i>; but <i>Maurice</i> advising
them that it would not be so convenient for them, they chang’d their Resolution.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Isleos</i> taken by <i>Lichthart</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Whilest <i>Lichthart</i> Cruis’d a considerable time before the Haven <i>Todos los Sanctos</i>,
he Crain’d his Ship in the Bay of <i>Camaniu</i>, took the Town <i>Isleos</i>, with a hundred and
fifty Men. In the Town, which is built on a Promontory, he took but little Booty,
and sav’d the Houses, which were built most of Stone, as also the four Churches
and <i>Jesuits</i> Cloyster, and return’d to <i>Reciffa</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Colonel <i>Latan</i> slain.</div>

<p class='c010'>About this time the invincible Castle <i>Mina</i>, afterwards call’d <i>St. Joris</i>, was taken
by the <i>Hollanders</i>, upon the Advice of <i>Nicholas van Yperen</i>, Commander of <i>Guinee</i>,
who sent word to <i>Grave Maurice</i>, that the said Castle might easily be conquer’d, if
any Forces could be sent him from <i>Reciffa</i>: Whereupon <i>Maurice</i> immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_564'>564</span>sent <i>John Coin</i> thither with nine Ships, which set Sail on the twenty fifth of <i>June</i>,
<i>Anno 1637.</i> who in the Road <i>Commendo</i> joining with <i>Yperen</i>, soon after he was set down
before it, and was preparing to Storm, had it surrendred to him upon Terms no
less advantageous to the <i>Hollanders</i>, than dishonorable to the Besieged, yet not
without the loss of many Men; for in their March thither they were fiercely set
upon by the <i>Negro</i>’s inhabiting the Village near the Castle; in which Conflict Colonel
<i>Latan</i> amongst others was slain. The Fort might very well have endur’d a
longer Siege, it being surrounded with double Moats, each twenty five Foot deep,
and high Bulwarks, which could not be undermin’d because of the Rocky Ground
on which they were built; and to make it yet more stronger, <i>Coin</i> after he had taken
it rais’d a Fort on the Hill, from whence he had fir’d on the Castle, in which he found
thirty Brass Demi-Culverins; and leaving <i>Walraeven Malburg</i> as Governor, he return’d
to <i>Reciffa</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>During these Proceedings of the <i>Dutch</i> in <i>Guinee</i>, the Duke of <i>Bagnola</i> ransack’d
the Countrey about <i>Seregippa del Rey</i>; <i>Maurice</i> not able to go himself, having had a
Feaver three Moneths, sent <i>Schuppe</i> and <i>Gyseling</i> with two thousand three hundred
Soldiers, four hundred <i>Brasilians</i>, and two hundred and fifty Seamen, whilest <i>Lichthart</i>
Steer’d to <i>Todos los Sanctos</i>, that so he might draw the Enemy down to the Sea-Coast.
<i>Bagnola</i> flying to <i>Terra Gracia d’ Avila</i>, <i>Schuppe</i> demolish’d the Town <i>Seregippa</i>,
the Sugar-Mills, and all manner of Fruit-Trees, and march’d with incredible
speed to the Stream <i>Francisco</i>; where Encamping on the Southern Shore, he drove
three thousand Head of Cattel before him, that so he might starve the Enemy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Brasilians</i> offer their assistance to the <i>Dutch</i> for the taking the Fort <i>Siara</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the interim the <i>Brasilians</i> in <i>Siara</i> desir’d Aid against the <i>Portuguese</i>, offering,
That if the <i>Hollanders</i> could conquer the Fort there, they would soon destroy all
the <i>Portuguese</i>; that the Charges of the Siege might easily be made good, the Countrey
producing abundance of Amber-greece, Crystal, Cotton, Pearls, Salt, and
other Merchandise. In confirmation of this their Resolution, the <i>Brasilians</i> left two
eminent Persons Children of <i>Siara</i> in <i>Reciffa</i>: Whereupon <i>George Garstman</i> being
sent thither, was no sooner Landed, but he made his Arrival known to the <i>Brasilian</i>
Governor <i>Algodoi</i>; who came to meet him with two hundred Men, bearing white
Flags in token of Peace: Thus assisted, he set upon <i>Siara</i>, which is a square Fort,
built at the foot of a Hill, hath within its Walls six Houses, two Redoubts full of
Port-holes, one on the North, and the other on the South, jutting half way out
from the Wall; as also two Gates, secur’d with large Portcullises: without the Fort
appears the Governor’s House, about which were several Huts for <i>Portugueses</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Lordship, already spoken of, is reckon’d amongst the Northern parts of
<i>Brasile</i>, and hath onely twelve Leagues in circumference. The Haven before the
Castle, which the River <i>Hacu</i> makes, is of little consequence: The Ground in
some places rises with high Mountains, in others, especially on one side, it is overgrown
with Wood: hath also several brave Pastures, especially along the River.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fort taken by <i>Garstman</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Garstman</i> approaching the Castle <i>Siara</i>, found little resistance, so that he took it
with small expence of Blood, most of the <i>Portuguese</i> being taken Prisoners, a few
onely escaping by flight.</p>

<p class='c010'>After this <i>Grave Maurice</i> took great care of the Civil Affairs, building a Guild-Hall
at his own Cost and Charge; sent all manner of Minerals, digg’d out of the
<i>Brasilian</i> Mines, to the <i>Netherlands</i>; laid great Penalties on those that stole the Custom
of Goods, and punish’d with Death Murders, Robberies, and such like Capital
Offences, besides several wholsom Laws relating both to the Civil and Ecclesiastical
Government; and as soon as he was recover’d from his tedious Sickness,
he march’d up into the Countrey to the Rivers <i>Grande</i> and <i>Parayba</i>, to take care to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_565'>565</span>furnish the Forts with Provision and Ammunition. Near the Castle <i>Ceulen</i> he was
receiv’d by the <i>Tapuyan</i> Agents, and Presented by them with Bowes, Arrows, and
brave Ostrich Feathers, us’d by them when they go to the Wars: in return for
which they receiv’d Linnen Shirts, Knives, Shells, Bugles, Fishhooks, and Nails.
<i>Maurice</i> caus’d a deeper and wider Moat to be digg’d about the decay’d Castle <i>Cabo
Dello</i>, rais’d the Works, and call’d it by the Name of his Sister <i>Margareta</i>; he also
pull’d down the Fort <i>Antonio</i>, keeping onely a Tower to defend the High-way. <i>Restringa</i>
was likewise strengthned with Pallisado’s, and the Cloyster near the Town
<i>Parayba</i> fortifi’d against an Assault, and <i>Elias Harkmans</i> made Governor of the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whilest these things were transacted on the Land, Captain <i>Schuppe</i> at Sea Engaging
alone between <i>Todos los Sanctos</i> and <i>Terre Garcie d’ Avila</i> with three <i>Spanish</i> Ships,
drove one of them aground, and brought another away with him to <i>Reciffa</i>. The
Letters found in the taken Vessel made mention, that in the River of <i>Lisbon</i> lay ten
Galleys, and twenty more before <i>Cales</i>, to which were to joyn thirty Pinks; which
Fleet some suppos’d was coming for <i>Brasile</i>; others, that it was onely a Plot of the
King of <i>Spain</i> to get Money from his Subjects, according to the Custom of several
other Princes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hereupon <i>Maurice</i> wrote to the <i>West-India</i> Company, that they would Rig out a
Fleet with all possible speed, which might fall upon the fore-mention’d <i>Spanish</i> Fleet,
and fetch those Sugars which lay ready in <i>Brasile</i> to be Laden.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the same time a Party of the <i>Portugueses</i> crossing the River <i>Francisco</i>, came
to the Stream <i>Miguel</i>, whither <i>Picard</i> marching, put them all to flight.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Grave Maurice</i> sets forth with a Fleet for the re-taking of <i>St. Salvador</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Grave Maurice</i> is forc’d to leave the Siege of <i>St. Salvador</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Grave Maurice</i> having a Design on <i>St. Salvador</i>, the <i>Portuguese</i> Metropolis in <i>Brasile</i>,
formerly taken by <i>Peter Hein</i> and <i>Jacob Willekens</i>, and not long after lost by the
faint-heartedness of <i>William Schouten</i> and <i>Hans Kyf</i>, though in all likelihood not
strong enough to undertake so weighty a Design, yet considering if he should stay
longer, the Season would not permit him, therefore he went aboard, hoping that
he should receive some Aid from the <i>Netherlands</i>; his Army consisted of three thousand
four hundred <i>Netherlanders</i>, and a thousand <i>Brasilians</i>. He had the greater hopes
of Victory, because he receiv’d information from <i>St. Salvador</i>, that the Soldiers in
Garrison there mutiny’d for want of Pay, and that the Governor and Duke of <i>Bagnola</i>
were at difference concerning the management of the War. But before he set
Sail he had secur’d all Places against any Invasion, and got ready twenty two Sail,
furnish’d with Ammunition and Provision, with which on the eighteenth of <i>August</i>
Anno 1638. he weigh’d Anchor, and met with six Ships at Sea, which he took,
and arriv’d on the sixth day following before the Mouth of the Inlet <i>Todos los Sanctos</i>,
which he could not enter by reason of contrary Winds, but Cruis’d up and down
before the River <i>Vermelho</i> and the Isle <i>Tapoam</i>; whereupon the Governor of <i>St. Salvador</i>
and <i>Bagnola</i> drew the <i>Portuguese</i> Forces down thither to prevent his Landing:
About Noon the Wind coming about fair for the <i>Hollanders</i>, brought <i>Maurice</i>
within Shot of the Ships, Forts, Walls and Batteries of the City <i>St. Salvador</i>, so
that he thundred with his Cannon against them, and Landed on a Promontory
near the Sconce <i>Bartholomew</i>, without the least resistance, in a convenient place about
a League and a half from the City; where Encamping himself, he was inform’d by
the Prisoners which he had taken, that about half a League farther was a narrow
Bank, border’d with Morasses, so that none could pass along the same but at Low-water,
and then onely at a certain time. <i>Tourlon</i> being sent before with three
hundred Musquetteers to discover the Place, found the Way not onely as the Prisoners
had inform’d, but also fortifi’d by the Enemy; against whom <i>Maurice</i> drew
out his Men, ordering Captain <i>John vander Mast</i> in the mean time to run with ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_566'>566</span>Sail directly upon the City, and to drop his Anchors just without shot of it. Having
beaten the Enemy from his Works, he broke through all the Paths, Hedges
and Banks, till at last he came and Intrench’d himself near the Out-works of the
City, by which his Army was secur’d from any Assaults from the Sea-side. Colonel
<i>Brand</i> also with little trouble took the Fort <i>Philippo</i>, built on the Shore, and fortifi’d
with five Guns. The next day <i>Maurice</i> Storming the Castle <i>Philippo</i>, soon became
Master of it, notwithstanding it was well Garrison’d, and had thirteen Brass Demi-Culverins.
The taking of this Castle afforded the Besiegers a free Passage to their
Fleet. They also rais’d two Batteries, from one of which they shot night and day
with seven great Guns, and from the other with the like number of Field-pieces,
on the Castle <i>Rosario</i>, which the <i>Portuguese</i> forsook; but going about to take a
Horn-work on the top of the <i>Carmelites</i> Cloyster, he lost many Men in the Attempt,
and amongst the rest the Captains <i>Howin</i>, <i>Echbrecht</i>, <i>Boward</i>, <i>Hollinger</i>, and the Engineer
<i>Berchem</i>; and in the end, after many bold and resolute Attaques, what with
the strength of the Place, both for number of Defendants, and well fortifi’dness
thereof, and what with the want of his expected Supplies, and lastly the sickliness
of his Army, by reason of the extraordinary Rains that fell, to the loss of many
Officers of note as well as common Soldiers, besides what were slain by the Enemy,
he made as honorable a Retreat as he could, so that this Expedition prov’d altogether
unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mean while the Provincial <i>States</i> of <i>Holland</i> and <i>Zealand</i> differ’d about allowing
of a free Trade to <i>Brasile</i>, and sending of Colonies thither: Whereupon <i>Grave
Maurice</i> writing to them his Opinion, demonstrated with good Reasons, that a
free Trade, and fresh Colonies, would be much to the Companies advantage;
which was approv’d of by the <i>States</i> of the <i>United Netherlands</i> and <i>West-India</i> Company,
who onely engross’d the Trade of <i>Negro</i>’s and <i>Brasile</i> Wood; and on the Imported
and Exported Goods they put a certain Custom.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Houte-been</i> Engages the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>West-India</i> Company considering what Treasure <i>Peter Hein</i> had brought
from <i>Matanca</i> to <i>Holland</i>, they resolv’d to venture another Expedition thither; and
to that purpose set out fourteen Sail under the Command of <i>Cornelis Houte-been</i>, who
weigh’d Anchor out of the <i>Texel</i> on the fourteenth of <i>August</i> Anno 1638. and arriv’d
safe at <i>Reciffa</i>; where <i>Houte-been</i> having spent some days in Consulting with
<i>Grave Maurice</i>, went aboard again, and at his entring into the Ship, bruis’d his Leg
between the Boat and the sides thereof, which some superstitious Persons look’d
upon as very ominous; but this Wound was not so great as to keep him back
from whatsoever Service came in his way: for discovering the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet from
<i>Terra Firma</i> near <i>Cuba</i>, before the Rocky Isle <i>Organes</i>, which consisted of eight great
Gallions, and six lesser Ships, whose Lading was valu’d at two hundred Tun of
Gold, and Commanded by <i>Carel Dievaro</i>, he clapt the Admiral aboard, threw in
his Grapling-Irons, and made him self fast, with a Resolution either to take him or
die, whilest the <i>Dutch</i> Vice-Admiral <i>Abraham Michaelzoon Roosendael</i> boarded the <i>Spanish</i>
Vice-Admiral, and the Rere-Admiral <i>John vander Mast</i> the Enemy’s Rere-Admiral;
and doubtless, had not the Vice-Admiral and Rere-Admiral been slain,
together with <i>Verdoost</i>, Captain of the <i>Orange-Tree</i>, and other eminent Officers, and
those that surviv’d fail’d in their Duty to him for want of Courage, he had given
them a signal Overthrow; but whilest with much ado he had prevail’d with his
Captains to renew the Combat (having been forc’d by the coming on of the <i>Spanish</i>
Vice and Rere-Admirals to quit his hold) and was preparing for a second Onset,
the Sea began to be rough, and the Enemy was gotten to the Windward. Some
few days after being inform’d, that the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet lay before the Flats of <i>Cuba</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_567'>567</span>and the Rocky <i>Organes</i>, Steer’d thither, resolving to venture once more; but when
he came there, the <i>Spaniards</i> were gone; whereupon he sent some of his Ships to
<i>Brasile</i>, others to Cruise before <i>Cuba</i>, whilest he himself went for the <i>Netherlands</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whilest this Expedition fell out so unfortunately, <i>Cameron</i>, General of the <i>Brasilians</i>,
sent three Agents to <i>Grave Maurice</i>, desiring to enter into League with the <i>West-India</i>
Company, upon some Differences that were risen between him and the Duke
of <i>Bagnola</i>. <i>Grave Maurice</i> seeming much inclin’d to his Offer, treated the Agents
very nobly; who not long after, oblig’d by his Civility, inform’d him, that <i>Cameron</i>,
an inconstant Man, had made Peace again with <i>Bagnola</i>. But that which chiefly
obstructed <i>Grave Maurice</i>’s Designs, was the want of Provisions, Ammunition and
Men, notwithstanding his continual Complaints to the Company.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the beginning of the Year 1639. the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet, consisting of twenty
eight Sail, most of them Gallions, appear’d in sight of <i>Reciffa</i>, but Steer’d Southwardly;
<i>Grave Maurice</i> hereupon sent out the best Sailers to follow them, and see
whither they were bound, or if they intended to Land, whilest himself march’d
along to <i>Porto Calvo</i>; but inform’d that they were gone into the Inlet <i>Todos los Sanctos</i>,
he return’d to <i>Reciffa</i>, after he had stor’d the Forts <i>Porto Calvo</i>, <i>Una</i>, <i>Serinhain</i>,
and that at the Promontory <i>St. Augustine</i>, with all Necessaries.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Arcisseusky</i> Impeaches <i>Grave Maurice</i> and his Council.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Is sent back into <i>Holland</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>About the same time <i>Arcisseusky</i> arriving from <i>Holland</i> with a Commission to be
General over the Forces there, imparted to some Friends the Copy of a Letter that
he intended to send to the <i>Amsterdam</i> Burgomaster <i>Albert Coenraedszoon vander Burgh</i>,
containing many Accusations against <i>Grave Maurice</i> and his Council; of which he
being inform’d, call’d a general Assembly, to whom he makes a large Speech, wherein
he declar’d how faithful a Servant he had been to the <i>States</i> of the <i>United Netherlands</i>
for the space of twenty years, complain’d of the malice of <i>Arcisseusky</i> in wrongfully
aspersing him, both in the aforesaid Letter and otherwise, answer’d particularly to
every thing which was laid to his Charge, (as he did afterwards in a Letter also
from himself to <i>Vander Burgh</i>) and lastly made it his peremptory Request, that he
might return home, and leave <i>Arcisseusky</i> in Power, or that <i>Arcisseusky</i> might be sent
home, and he remain undisturb’d in his Government; and so withdrew, leaving
them to their own Consultations. It exceedingly perplex’d them, and took up a
long Debate what Judgment to give in this Matter, which before they concluded
on, they propos’d several Expedients of Reconciliation between them; but seeing
it was all in vain, they unanimously judg’d it convenient, that <i>Arcisseusky</i> should
return; who not long after accordingly weigh’d Anchor from <i>Parayba</i> for <i>Holland</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Several Judgments concerning him.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Arcisseusky</i> arriving in <i>Holland</i>, appear’d unexpectedly before the <i>States</i> of the
<i>United Netherlands</i> and <i>West-India</i> Company, where several Judgments were pass’d
upon him; some said he deserv’d severe punishment, for his misbehavior to <i>Grave
Maurice</i>; others seem’d to have compassion of him, because he had done so many
noble Exploits; most laid the blame on the Company, who rashly sent him
with a Commission as Chief over the <i>Militia</i>, not without impairing <i>Grave Maurice</i>’s
Power; but these Discourses fell amongst those who were not call’d to give their
Opinion of this Case.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Coin</i> sent Field-Marshal in his stead.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>John Coin</i> was chosen Field-Marshal in <i>Arcisseusky</i>’s stead, whilest the Councellors
<i>Matthias Ceulen</i>, <i>Adrian vander Dussen</i>, <i>John Guiseling</i>, and <i>Servaes Carpentier</i>, were ready
to come for <i>Holland</i>, and on the twenty ninth of <i>October</i> 1639. they set Sail from
<i>Parayba</i>, <i>Vander Dussen</i> bringing with him an exact Relation of the Condition of
<i>Brasile</i>, so far as concerns the <i>West-India</i> Company, which being material, we shall
reserve it for a more fit place.</p>

<p class='c010'>It being fear’d that the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet in the Harbor of <i>Todos los Sanctos</i> might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_568'>568</span>undertake some Design or other against the <i>Hollanders</i>, <i>Grave Maurice</i> kept a watchful
Eye upon them, repair’d all decay’d Forts, rais’d new Forces, sent out some
Vessels to watch the Fleet, and prohibited the Transporting of Provisions, animated
the <i>Brasilian</i> Commanders to fight against the <i>Portuguese</i>, and forc’d the Owners
of Sugar-Mills to Plant store of <i>Mandihoka</i>, that so his Provisions might last the
longer.</p>

<p class='c010'>A Party of the Enemy, consisting of about twelve hundred Men, having pass’d
the River <i>Francisco</i>, was soon after oppos’d by Colonel <i>Donker</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A <i>Spanish</i> Fleet lies before <i>St. Salvador</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spanish</i> Fleet having lay’n a whole Year before <i>St. Salvador</i> (because they had
lost near three thousand Men, who on the Coast of <i>Africa</i> dy’d of several Distempers,
and therefore waited for a fresh Supply) set Sail on the ninteenth of <i>November
Anno 1639.</i> with eighty seven Sail, carrying sixteen thousand Men, of which thirty
seven were great Gallions. <i>Ferdinand Mascarenhas</i>, Duke of <i>Torre</i>, being chief Admiral,
carry’d the Flag and sixty Brass Guns in the Ship <i>Domingo</i>; the <i>Portuguese</i>
Admiral, <i>Roderigo Lobo</i>, carry’d fifty two Guns in the Gallion <i>Bernardo</i>; of all
which, with the number of the Enemy’s Forces, <i>Grave Maurice</i> was inform’d by a
Letter taken out of a Pink laden with Sugar; and also that the <i>Spaniards</i> were in
great hopes of the <i>Portuguese</i> deserting the <i>West-India</i> Company, with whom they
were forc’d to joyn; that this great Fleet was order’d to Cruise two years before the
Coast of <i>Brasile</i>, and to Land divers Men under the Command of <i>Bagnola</i>, <i>Francisco
de Moro</i>, <i>Antonio Roderigo</i>, <i>Nunno de Mello</i>, <i>Jacob Pirezio</i>, <i>Francisco Pezam</i>, and <i>Lopes Barbalio</i>;
all which made <i>Maurice</i> write continually for Aid, “Which the <i>West-India</i>
Company must send speedily, unless they were resolv’d to lose what they had
gotten in <i>Brasile</i>, as also the People, who had hitherto defended the same with the
loss of their Lives and Fortunes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A <i>Negro</i> that serv’d a <i>Spanish</i> Captain, call’d <i>Henrick Dias</i>, being taken, inform’d
the <i>Hollanders</i>, That the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet was much weakned by a poysonous Air on the
Coast of <i>Africa</i>; and that they had left a considerable number of their Men in the
Hospital at <i>St. Salvador</i>; that the Admiral was resolv’d with divided Forces to
burn all Places he came at, and to receive the <i>Negro</i>’s, <i>Mamolucks</i>, <i>Mulatto</i>’s, and <i>Brasilians</i>,
under his Jurisdiction. But <i>Grave Maurice</i> gave little credit to this Relation,
because the <i>Spaniard</i> doubted not in the least, but that he should take <i>Brasile</i> from the
<i>Netherlanders</i> with his fore-mention’d Forces, why then should he ruine what he
hop’d to possess? None knew whither the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet intended to go; for setting
Sail under the Command of <i>Antonio Oquendo</i>, under pretence of falling upon the
<i>Netherlands</i>, they Steer’d their Course to <i>Brasile</i>, and at last from the Inlet <i>Todos los
Sanctos</i> to <i>Goyana</i>; but four days before they weigh’d Anchor, <i>William Corneliszoon
Loos</i>, who had some time been Cruising before the said Inlet, came back to <i>Reciffa</i>
with thirteen Sail of Ships, which wanted all manner of Necessaries.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Huigens</i> chaseth the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Alderick</i>’s valiant Exploit.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>West-India</i> Company had now been in a mean Condition, had there not
happily arriv’d first eight, next two, and at last nine Ships from the <i>Texel</i>, the <i>Maes</i>,
and <i>Zealand</i>, with Provisions, and a Supply of Men; which <i>Maurice</i> had no sooner
taken out, and unladen the Ships, but he fitted them for an Engagement, and made
up the number of forty one Sail, who yet were not to be compar’d to the <i>Spaniards</i>,
whose smallest Vessels carry’d more Men and Guns than the biggest of the <i>Hollanders</i>,
which in all had but two thousand one hundred and ninety six Men, and one
Ship with another under twenty Iron Guns: With this small Power the Admiral
<i>William Corneliszoon Loos</i> went to meet the Enemy, and before the River <i>Michael</i> took
four <i>Spanish</i> Ships, which carry’d Ammunition and Provisions for the Army,
which <i>Lopes Barbalio</i> commanded ashore. On the twelfth of <i>January, Anno 1640.</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_569'>569</span>he descry’d the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet between <i>Itamaraca</i> and <i>Goyana</i>; not far from which <i>Mascarenhas</i>
thought to Land seven thousand Men at <i>Paomorello</i>; and they were already
gotten into little Vessels when the <i>Hollanders</i> Fleet made towards them, and about
three a Clock in the Afternoon began a bloody Engagement for four hours, in
which <i>Loos</i> Engaging with the <i>Spanish</i> Admiral and four Gallions, was kill’d in the
middle of the Fight, which ended in the Evening. <i>Jacob Huigens</i> carrying the Flag
the next day in sight of the Promontory <i>Blanco</i>, chearing up his Men, went to renew
the Fight with <i>Mascarenhas</i>, and with a few small Ships Engag’d several great
ones, of which they had an advantage onely in their nimble turning and winding.
In this Engagement <i>Huigens</i> lost the Ship call’d <i>The Sun</i>, which sunk with
Colonel <i>Mortimer</i> and forty four Men, thirty four being sav’d in the Boat. The
<i>Hollanders</i> Loss was the less, because the <i>Spanish</i> great Gallions fir’d over <i>Huigens</i>’s
Ships, which fir’d in the midst of the <i>Spaniards</i> Vessels. <i>Huigens</i> not being tir’d
with two days Engagements, fell upon them a third time before <i>Parayba</i>, and firing
at the <i>Spanish</i> and <i>Portuguese</i> Admirals, pursu’d their Fleet to the Northermost Coast
of <i>Brasile</i>, where by a strong Current they were driven Westerly; and the <i>Swan</i>,
Commanded by <i>Jacob Alderick</i>, losing her Main-mast, was cut off from the Fleet
by twelve Gallions; and three hundred <i>Spaniards</i> were already Masters of the Deck,
when <i>Alderick</i> breaking from the Enemy, drove towards the Shore, and either kill’d
the <i>Spaniards</i> that were in his Ship, or forc’d them to leap overboard, whilest <i>Antonio
Cunha de Andrada</i>, not knowing that <i>Alderick</i> was aground, making up to him,
ran also aground, which occasion’d a new Fight, and at last <i>Andrada</i> was made to
surrender his Gallion, and with it three thousand Pound of coin’d and uncoin’d
Silver, besides other rich Goods, and two hundred and thirty Men, who were all
sent Prisoners to <i>Reciffa</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Spanish</i> Fleet again put to flight by <i>Huigens</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>January</i> the seventeenth <i>Huigens</i> ventur’d a fourth Engagement between <i>Rio
Grande</i> and <i>Conyaou</i>, where approaching the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet, a sudden Calm prevented
him from coming within shot of them, till against the Evening the Wind began to
rise, but the Night approaching, it was not judg’d worth while to Engage for so few
hours, therefore they referr’d the bloody work till the next day; when about Daybreak
<i>Huigens</i> ran through the midst of the Enemy’s Fleet, and fir’d so fiercely on
<i>Mascarenhas</i>, that he Tacking about, stood away right before the Wind, and not being
able to get beyond the Shelves <i>Baxios de Rochas</i>, nor to get Water on the Coast,
because the <i>Hollanders</i> Ketches guarded the same, he Sail’d into the Offin towards
the <i>Line</i> with a South-East Wind. After which <i>Huigens</i> lay eight days before <i>Rio
Grande</i> to refresh and rest himself, and on the first of <i>February</i> he arriv’d at <i>Reciffa</i>,
where <i>Maurice</i> caus’d a Thanksgiving Day to be kept for this wonderful Victory,
whilest the Enemy was exceedingly abash’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>Several Disadvantages occurr’d towards the overthrow of the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet; for
first it was much weakned by the Disease which rag’d in the same on the Coast of
<i>Africa</i>, insomuch that it lay still a whole year in <i>Todos los Sanctos</i> to gather fresh Forces,
whilest <i>Maurice</i> put himself in a posture of Defence: Secondly, they lay becalm’d,
and met with contrary Winds for several Moneths, whenas the Voyage between
<i>St. Salvador</i> and <i>Pernambuco</i> is commonly not above twelve days; which tedious
Passage occasion’d also a Distemper and faint-heartedness amongst the <i>Spaniards</i>,
whilest divers Ships arriv’d at <i>Reciffa</i> from the <i>Netherlands</i>, without which it had
been impossible to have Engag’d with the Enemy, in regard till then all manner
of Ammunition and Provisions were wanting. <i>Huigens</i> also had continually the
advantage or benefit of the Wind, and lost in the Engagement but two Ships, a
hundred and twenty four Men, besides twelve wounded: Moreover, but twelve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_570'>570</span>Ships onely of the <i>Dutch</i> Engag’d with this great <i>Spanish</i> Fleet, the rest never coming
within shot; wherefore the two Commanders, <i>John Coopman Ryk</i>, and <i>Peter Jacob</i>,
were condemn’d to be Beheaded; <i>Cornelis Johnszoon</i> and <i>Peter Dirkszoon</i> had their
Swords broke over their Heads by the common Hangman; <i>Cornelis Lucifer</i>, <i>Dirk
Eger</i>, and <i>Jacob Clavor</i>, were banish’d; and others came off by paying great Fines:
but the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet lost in the four Engagements twenty Ships, and some thousands
of Men, the <i>Joseph</i> alone having four hundred slain in her. Lastly, anchoring near
the Island <i>Margareta</i>, the <i>Portuguese</i> Admiral <i>Cosmo de Couto</i>, and the Captain-General
<i>Francisco Pimentello</i>, falling out, the <i>Spaniards</i> Steer’d to <i>Tercera</i>, and from thence to
<i>Cales</i>, where there Landed but few Men, most of them dying of Hunger and Thirst
in their Return home: Four Gallions, with two Pinks, got into the <i>Spanish</i> Harbors,
the rest being either stranded before <i>New Spain</i>, sunk, or return’d to the Inlet <i>Todos
los Sanctos</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cameron</i>’s Forces and <i>Barbalio</i>’s put to flight by <i>Coin</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Portugueses</i> Plot against the <i>Netherlanders</i> discover’d.</div>

<p class='c010'>Before the foremention’d Fleet weigh’d Anchor from <i>St. Salvador</i>, two thousand
<i>Portugueses</i>, besides <i>Tapuyans</i> and other <i>Brasilians</i>, march’d under the Command
of <i>Cameron</i>, <i>Vidal</i>, and <i>Barbalio</i>, with divided Forces into the Countrey, partly to
get Provision, and partly to do what mischief they could to the <i>Hollanders</i>, far
and near: their Orders were to joyn in the Village <i>St. Laurence</i>, seven Leagues beyond
<i>Paomarello</i>, that there they might make way for the Seamen to Land, if the
<i>Netherland</i> Forces should chance to guard the Sea-Coast thereabouts, and to joyn
with them as soon as they were Landed. But <i>Grave Maurice</i> encourag’d by his late
Victory at Sea, immediately sent the Field-Marshal <i>Coin</i> against <i>Cameron</i>, who
dividing his Army into small Companies, had distributed them through the
Woods; in which <i>Coin</i> follow’d his Example, and with divided Forces pursu’d
<i>Cameron</i>’s Army, and overtook his Captain <i>Tak</i> and two hundred Men at <i>Poyuca</i>,
(whereof <i>Lopes Barbalio</i> was Governor) who fled, notwithstanding he Commanded
six hundred Men. Soon after which the Muster-master <i>Mansveld</i> met him near the
Village <i>St. Laurence</i>, Engag’d him, and putting him to flight, found several Papers
of Concern that he had left behind, and amongst others a Letter, in which <i>Barbalio</i>
was commanded to spare neither <i>Brasilians</i> nor <i>Netherlanders</i> alive, but to kill all,
without regard either to their Age or Quality, except the <i>Portuguese</i>. Moreover,
<i>Andries Vidal</i> urg’d the Owners of the Sugar-Mills in the <i>Netherlanders Brasile</i>, immediately
to take up Arms, to regain their ancient Freedom, as soon as <i>Mascarenhas</i>
appear’d with the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet on the Coast of <i>Brasile</i>: Thus <i>Vidal</i>, by Letters and
private Conferences, prevail’d so much, that most of the <i>Portuguese</i> were ready
against their Oaths to root out the <i>Netherlanders</i>: The sign when they should be
ready, was the burning of some Sugar-Mills, <i>Vidal</i> imagining thereby to have
drawn the <i>Netherlanders</i> from the Sea-side, and so made the Sea-Coast free for the
<i>Spaniards</i> to Land securely in. But the Garrison under <i>Coin</i> along the Sea-shore
near <i>Alexis</i>, not ignorant of the Enemy’s Plot, kept their Stations, and suffer’d
the Mills to burn. The like did <i>Craey</i> at the Promontory of St. <i>Augustine</i>,
<i>Picard</i> at <i>Paomarello</i>, Captain <i>Day</i> at <i>Cantolaria</i>, and <i>Donker</i> on <i>Goyana</i>; <i>Hoogstraet</i> kept
Guard up in the Countrey; <i>Tourlon</i> also sent out by <i>Maurice</i> against <i>Francisco Sosa</i>
and <i>Henrick Dias</i>, who had pillag’d all the Countrey about the River <i>Conajou</i>, fell
upon them in such a manner, that he destroy’d eighty seven of them, and wounded
a considerable number more of them, made the rest flie to St. <i>Salvador</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two Moneths before the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet set Sail from <i>Todos los Sanctos</i>, three thousand
<i>Tapuyans</i> came to <i>Rio Grande</i> with their Wives and Children, from an unknown
Countrey remote from the Sea. <i>Grave Maurice</i> requested their King <i>John de Wy</i>, that
he would please to keep Watch along the Sea-Coast, and prevent the Landing of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_571'>571</span>the <i>Spanish</i> Seamen: Whereupon <i>De Wy</i> sent his Son to the Castle <i>Ceulen</i>, making
solemn Protestations, that he was ready to lose his Life and Fortune for the <i>Netherlanders</i>,
in helping them to drive the <i>Portuguese</i> out of <i>Brasile</i>. <i>Maurice</i> also joyn’d
two thousand <i>Brasilians</i>, and Colonel <i>Garstman</i> with sixty <i>Netherlanders</i>, to the <i>Tapuyans</i>,
that so he might train them up in Martial Discipline, whilest the <i>Tapuyans</i>
Wives and Children were plac’d on the Island <i>Tamarica</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the beginning of the Year 1640. <i>Houte-been</i> and <i>Lichthart</i> brought a
considerable Fleet from the <i>Netherlands</i> to an Anchor at <i>Reciffa</i>, where a Consultation
was held, whither these Ships might be sent to do most Service: every
one had an Eye on St. <i>Salvador</i>, not long since Storm’d in vain; but <i>Maurice</i>
judg’d that they had not Forces enough to undertake so grand a Design, but thought
it would be better to Land some fresh Forces near St. <i>Salvador</i>, that there they might
burn the Sugar-Mills, and destroy all things they could find, in revenge of what
the Enemy had done at <i>Parayba</i>. Whereupon <i>Tourlon</i> and <i>Lichthart</i> set Sail with
twenty Ships, Mann’d with two thousand five hundred Men, to the Inlet <i>Todos los
Sanctos</i>, where they burnt all the <i>Portuguese</i> Sugar-Mills, Houses and Villages; neither
did their Swords spare any alive but Women and Infants: The Cattel which
they found they carry’d aboard of their Ships, and burnt all other Provisions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Capt. <i>Brand</i> taken Prisoner.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Coin</i> unsuccessfully Storms <i>Spirito Sancto</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the mean time <i>Houte-been</i> and <i>Coin</i> fell upon <i>Porto Franco</i>, where they ruin’d all
things, to no other end, but that the Enemy might call home his Forces out of the
<i>Netherlanders Brasile</i>, to defend the Province <i>Todos los Sanctos</i>. But Captain <i>Brand</i>
going up too far into the Countrey with his Army, was suddenly set upon, had a
hundred of his Men slain on the Spot, and was himself taken Prisoner, together
with many more. Also the Storming of the Town <i>Spirito Sancto</i> by <i>Coin</i> prov’d unsuccessful,
because he led an undisciplin’d Company, and wanted little Vessels to
Land in on a sudden; for the Enemy having had timely notice, immediately rais’d
a Sconce about the Town, and with five Brass Guns fir’d stoutly on him, who endeavor’d
to climb up the Hill, but was forc’d to sound a Retreat, his Men failing
in their Courage; yet at last breaking into the Town, he set some of the Houses on
fire, which being built of Stone, resisted the Flame; so burning onely four hundred
and fifty Chests of Sugar, he left sixty Men kill’d, and brought back eighty
wounded. <i>Lichthart</i> in the mean time made great havock about St. <i>Salvador</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Woods of <i>Brasile</i> set on fire by <i>Peter Vist</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>In this Conjuncture the <i>West-India</i> Company suffer’d much by Robberies and
Spoils committed up and down the Countrey, by the setting their Woods of <i>Brasile</i>
on fire by a company of <i>Negro</i>’s, the chief Ring-leader of whom was one call’d
<i>Peter Vist</i>, who from Caves and almost inaccessible Ways came forth in the Night,
and set fire on whatsoever places he came to, notwithstanding a hundred <i>Negro</i>’s
of his crew were soon after caught, which he at several times had by force taken
out of their Masters Sugars-Mills; which <i>Grave Maurice</i> prevented as much as possible,
by keeping Soldiers up and down in Arms. He also us’d the <i>Portuguese</i> very
civilly, who though they promis’d Obedience, because they liv’d under the Jurisdiction
of the <i>West-India</i> Company, yet were ready on all occasions to shew the
contrary; wherefore <i>Grave Maurice</i> sending for the chief of them to <i>Reciffa</i> from
<i>Pernambuco</i>, <i>Itamaraca</i>, and <i>Parayba</i>, told them before the Privy Council, that
they might easily see how vainly they expected that the <i>Spanish</i> Crown should take
<i>Brasile</i> from the <i>Netherlanders</i>; that formerly they depended on the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet
Commanded by <i>Mascarenhas</i>, but that being destroy’d by a small Force, that hope
was lost; therefore if henceforward they would Trade on their own Accounts, they
might be assur’d they should not suffer in the least, either in their Goods, Religion,
or Persons.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Hector de Calce</i> taken Prisoner.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_572'>572</span>The <i>Neopolitan</i> Field-Marshal <i>Hector de la Calce</i>, setting Sail from the Haven <i>Todos
los Sanctos</i> with an old Ship carrying six hundred Men, was forc’d to run aground
in the Haven of <i>Parayba</i>, where he and the chief Commanders were taken Prisoners,
whilest the Common Soldiers by reason of the scarcity of Provisions, were set at
liberty.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Houte-been</i> and <i>Lichthart</i> weigh’d Anchor with twenty four Ships, carrying two
thousand Soldiers and seven hundred Seamen to <i>Havana</i>, to Cruise for the Plate-Fleet,
but the <i>Spanish</i> Ships keeping within their Harbors, and their own being dispers’d
and scatter’d by ill Weather, their Voyage prov’d in vain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not long after <i>Grave Maurice</i> sent some Ships under <i>Lichtharts</i> Command to
Cruise before the River <i>Januarius</i>, and others for the same purpose to <i>Angola</i>; but
he effected little, for he onely took two Ships, one whereof being laden with Wine,
was sold for 9400 l. <i>Sterl.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>The news of the <i>Portuguese</i> Crowning the Duke of <i>Bragancia</i>, and casting off the
<i>Castilian</i> Yoke, which very much chang’d the face of Affairs in <i>Brasile</i>, was about this
time brought over by the Jesuit <i>Francisco Vilhent</i>, and the Under-Field-Marshal <i>Peter
Corera de Gama</i>, who were by <i>Bragancia</i> sent to St. <i>Salvador</i>, not onely to bring the
tidings of the <i>Portugueses</i> Revolt, but also to take the Oath of Allegiance from
<i>Montalvan</i> to the new King, which he made no scruple of; so that from thenceforth
all but the <i>Castilian</i> and <i>Neopolitan</i> Soldiers, cast off their Obedience to the
Crown of <i>Spain</i>. Whereupon <i>Montalvan</i> desir’d <i>Grave Maurice</i> to allow a Cessation of
Arms, till such time as they might both receive information what <i>Tristan Mendoza</i>,
in the new King of <i>Portugal</i>’s Name, had Treated with the <i>States</i> of the <i>United Netherlands</i>
about; and to make the Request seem the fairer, several <i>Dutch</i> Prisoners
were set at liberty, and the Companies with which <i>Paulo Acunhas</i> was marching to
<i>Pernambuco</i>, were call’d back.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Grave Maurice</i> desir’d by the <i>States</i> and <i>West-India</i> Company to continue in his Government of <i>Brasile</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Grave Maurice</i> desiring in his Letters to be releas’d from his Employment in
<i>Brasile</i>, receiv’d for Answer from the <i>States</i>, “That it would be very disadvantageous
for the <i>States</i> for him to come home, now he throughly understood the Intreagues
of the <i>New World</i>, in which he might do much good, especially since the
<i>Portuguese</i> being revolted, would in all probability assist them in destroying the
King of <i>Castile</i>’s Forces; therefore it was now the most proper time to prepare
for Action.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To this Request of the <i>States</i> was added that of the <i>West-India</i> Company, who
also sent earnest Letters to the same purpose; which made <i>Maurice</i> defer his Return,
and prepare himself for some grand Undertaking: And first he joyn’d the
Province of <i>Seregippe Del Rey</i> to the <i>Netherland Brasile</i>, built a Fort and Armory in
the same, and built a Wall about the Town; which Work was the more follow’d,
because <i>Seregippe</i>, which border’d upon the Province of <i>Todos los Sanctos</i>, fed abundance
of Cattel, and gave great hopes of Silver-Mines.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Loando</i> taken by <i>Houte-been</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Grave Maurice</i> likewise observing what great Profit proceeded from the <i>Angolan
Negro</i>’s, and that the <i>Spanish</i> Sugar-Mills could not work without them, undertook
to ingross that Trade wholly into the <i>West-India</i> Companies hands; to which purpose
<i>Loando St. Paulo</i> being judg’d a fit Place for a Factory, <i>Houte-been</i> was sent thither
with twenty Ships, Mann’d with nine hundred Seamen, two thousand Land-Soldiers,
and two hundred <i>Brasilians</i>: the Land-Men were Commanded by <i>Hinderson</i>,
who arriving with the Fleet on the twenty fourth of <i>August</i> 1640. before <i>Loando
St. Paulo</i>, ran in between the Enemy’s Castles, St. <i>Crux</i>, <i>Bento</i>, <i>Sibylla</i>, <i>Vincent</i>, <i>Velho</i>,
and against five Batteries along the Water side, all full of Guns, and fir’d so vehemently
upon the Enemy, that being forc’d to leave his Works, he made room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_573'>573</span>for <i>Hinderson</i> to Land; who immediately march’d to the Town, which <i>Peter Cæsar
Meneses</i> defended with nine hundred <i>Portugueses</i>, and some thousands of <i>Negro</i>’s, who
stood the first Onset; but <i>Hinderson</i> falling upon them again, so affrighted them,
that they fled; which <i>Meneses</i> perceiving, soon follow’d, and left him Master of the
City, in which he found onely a few drunken Soldiers, decrepid old People, twenty
nine Brass Guns, besides several Iron ones, and great plenty of Provisions and Ammunition.
Mean while <i>Houte-been</i> took thirty Ships hal’d near the Shore.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the City.</div>

<p class='c010'>This City is built on a Hill, and hath several fair Buildings and Cloysters,
amongst which the <i>Jesuits</i> and <i>Capuchins</i> are the best. Along the Sea-shore at the
foot of the Mountain, stands also a long Row of Houses, near which <i>Hinderson</i> immediately
cast up Bulwarks against any Assault, and likewise two Sconces, the biggest
whereof is on the utmost Point of <i>Loando</i> near the Fort <i>Sibylla</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Meneses</i> in vain Expostulates.</div>

<p class='c010'>Twelve companies being left here in Garrison, quite contrary to <i>Meneses</i> his expectation,
who thinking that the <i>Netherlanders</i> came onely for Booty, and not to
take or keep the City by force of Arms, made his Complaints therefore by Letters
to <i>Houte-been</i>, alledging, That there was Peace made between the King of <i>Portugal</i>
and the <i>United Netherlands</i>, and that the former Acts of Hostility were chang’d to
friendly Correspondencies. But <i>Houte-been</i> answer’d, “That he knew not of any
such Agreement between <i>Portugal</i> and the <i>Netherlands</i>; and if he had known it,
how should he be sure whether <i>Meneses</i> held with the <i>Castilians</i> or <i>Portugueses</i>? If
<i>Meneses</i> knew of this Agreement, and was of the <i>Portuguese</i> Party, why did he receive
those as Enemies, whom he must acknowledge as Friends? His Complaints
were now too late, since the <i>Hollanders</i> had obtain’d the Victory with the loss of
their Blood.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Meneses</i> therefore seeing no hopes to regain <i>Loando</i>, either by Complaints or
Force, desir’d eight days Cessation of Arms, that in that time he might fit himself
to go from thence to another Place; which the <i>Netherlanders</i> in Garrison would not
hearken to, but commanded him to march away immediately sixteen Leagues from
<i>Loando</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Great Profit of the <i>Negro</i>-Trade.</div>

<p class='c010'>Mean while the <i>Angolan</i> Princes joyning with the <i>Netherlanders</i> fell upon the <i>Portuguese</i>
where-e’re they met them. Moreover, several Citizens return’d to <i>Loando</i>,
and proffer’d half their <i>Negro</i>’s, if they might but have liberty to be Transported
to St. <i>Salvador</i> with the other half; but it was judg’d more convenient to keep
them, and by fair means also to invite the rest, because it appear’d by the <i>Angolan</i>
Accounts, that the profit of the <i>Negro</i>-Trade amounted yearly to sixty six Tuns
of Gold, the Charges of the Garrison, and fitting out of the Ships being deducted
from it. The <i>Spanish</i> King had yearly above fifteen thousand <i>Negro</i>’s from hence to
employ in his <i>American</i> Mines.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Isle</i> of St. <i>Thomas</i> taken by <i>Houte-been</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Great Mortality among the <i>Dutch</i> on the Island <i>St. Thomas</i>, by reason of the unwholsomness of the Place.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Houte-been</i> Sailing over from <i>Loando</i> to the Isle of St. <i>Thomas</i>, Landed some of his
Men over against the Sugar-Mills of St. <i>Juna</i>, and ran with his Fleet to an Anchor
near a square Castle, with intention to use no Hostility, unless provok’d; which the
<i>Portuguese</i> did by firing their Guns, and were answer’d by <i>Houte-been</i>, one of whose
Ships call’d the <i>Enchuisen</i> was blown up; those that Landed also met with some resistance
from divers <i>Negro</i>’s; yet at last they gain’d the Fort, in which they found six
Guns, and soon after march’d into the Town <i>Pavaosa</i>, where the Inhabitants had
left nothing but empty Houses; the great Castle they were forc’d to let alone, because
the Scaling-Ladders would not reach to the top of the Walls, which were
twenty eight foot high: But <i>Houte-been</i> coming ashore, rais’d a Battery behind the
Church, from whence he fir’d with six Demi-Cannons, and threw sixty five
Granado’s amongst the Besieged, twenty whereof burst with such violence, that all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_574'>574</span>things about them were beaten to pieces; and those in Garrison march’d out, notwithstanding
they might easily have endur’d a long Siege, having twenty Brass,
and sixteen Iron Guns, besides all manner of Ammunition.  <i>Houte-been</i> thus become
Master of all things on the Island of St. <i>Thomas</i>, sent for the fled <i>Portugueses</i>
into the City on reasonable Proffers, embrac’d by many of the Inhabitants and <i>Negro</i>’s.
But whilest <i>Houte-been</i> put all things in good order here, the Countrey Disease
began to rage amongst the Seamen, for those who but a little before climb’d up the
Walls couragiously, grew faint, and fell down in a Swoon; those who fought valiantly
against their Enemies, were now put into their Graves; in short, of a thousand
Men, a hundred were scarce left in health, the rest being departed, or lying Bedrid:
the unwholsom Air without any difference infected both great and small; for
the Commanders <i>Mastmaker</i>, <i>Valett</i>, <i>Dammert</i>, <i>Claudius</i>, <i>Teer</i>, <i>Tack</i>, and the chief in
this Expedition, <i>Houte-been</i>, were all taken off, and Interr’d in the chief Church of
<i>Pavoasa</i>, after the finishing of so much bloody Work. Most complain’d of intolerable
Head-ache, even to Distraction, others also of horrible Gripings; and all
those who were afflicted either of these two ways, most certainly dy’d in four days
time. The occasion of this deadly Distemper was by divers, according to their different
Judgments, imputed to several Accidents; but doubtless it was chiefly to
be ascrib’d to the poysonous Damps or Fogs, which often rise in this Island, at
which times every one us’d to keep close in their Huts or Houses; which the <i>Netherlanders</i>
being ignorant of, neglected.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The first Colony sent thither by <i>John</i> the Third, King of <i>Portugal</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Portuguese</i> that dwelt on this Island inform’d the <i>Netherlanders</i>, that few liv’d
above fifty years there, yet notwithstanding the great Gain tempted them to tarry,
several of them having two or three hundred <i>Negro</i>’s that work’d in the Sugar-Mills;
that <i>John</i> the Third, King of <i>Portugal</i>, sent a Colony thither above two hundred
years before, whom though the unwholsom Air destroy’d, yet the Place was
not left desolate; for he sent new Inhabitants, who first Setled in <i>Guinee</i>, next in
<i>Angola</i>, and lastly on the Island St. <i>Thomas</i>, that so they might be the better us’d to
the Air; that the said King sold all those <i>Jews</i> for Slaves that refus’d to embrace
the <i>Roman</i> Religion, and caus’d their Children to be Baptiz’d, from whom (coming
thither in great numbers) most of the present Inhabitants were descended.</p>

<p class='c010'>Twice a year, <i>viz.</i> in <i>March</i> and <i>September</i>, the Sun is in the <i>Zenith</i> here, being
right perpendicular, and by that means makes no Shadow at Noon; but the Heat is
somewhat mollifi’d in these two Moneths by the Rains which fall, and in the Summer
by a West, or South Wind; for there never blow neither East nor Northerly
Winds.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Description of the Island.</div>

<p class='c010'>The white People that dwell here have commonly a Feaver every eighth day;
first they grow chill, next cold, and at last very hot, which lasts onely two hours.
They commonly Let Blood four times a year to prevent this Distemper. The <i>Negro</i>’s
generally attain to a great Age, many times to above a hundred years. The
Island bears the Name of St. <i>Thomas</i> from the Saint on whose Day the <i>Portuguese</i>
discover’d the same. From the middle of it rises a Hill, overgrown with Trees,
and cover’d on the top with Snow, which dropping down into certain Brooks, runs
through the Woods, and moistens the Cane-Fields. The Ground it self is tough,
and Ash-colour’d; in it breed blue Crabs like Moles, which hurt all manner of
Roots and Plants. The City of <i>Pavaosa</i> is the Metropolis of the Island, and a Bishop’s
See; it lies near a clear and pleasant Brook, and is flank’d on one side with
Hills, fruitful in the production of Sugar-Canes, but partakes of the unwholsom
Air of the Island, which therefore can scarce be defended by <i>Netherlanders</i>, because
they being unaccustom’d to the Climate, generally die: Wherefore <i>Grave Maurice</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_575'>575</span>advis’d the <i>States</i> to people this Place with Malefactors, who might either live here
to the Publick good, or die with less Disgrace than in a Prison.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The City <i>St. Lodowick</i> taken by <i>Coin</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Towards the latter end of the Year 1641. <i>Lichthart</i> and <i>Coin</i> weigh’d Anchor with
eight great, and six lesser Ships, and Sail’d to the Island of <i>Maragnon</i>; where <i>Coin</i>
Landing near the City St. <i>Lodowick</i>, march’d immediately to the Fort, wash’d
on both sides with one River, which there divides it self into two Branches: the
Governor of it being too weak to hold out a Storming, sent two eminent Persons
to <i>Coin</i>, with Proffers that they would surrender on reasonable Articles: whereupon
<i>Coin</i> granted them their Lives, and free possession of their Goods, and gave
leave to the Soldiers to stay in the City <i>St. Lodowick</i>, provided they had no Arms, till
Orders came from <i>Grave Maurice</i> and his Council at <i>Reciffa</i>. The <i>Hollanders</i> entring
the Fort found fifty five great Guns, abundance of all manner of Provisions, and
left six hundred Men in Garrison. But the new King of <i>Portugal</i> complain’d by his
Agent <i>Mendoza</i> to the <i>States</i> of the <i>United Netherlands</i>, concerning the Transactions
of the <i>West-India</i> Company, who had taken the <i>Loando</i>, and the Isles St. <i>Thomas</i> and
<i>Maragnan</i>, from him. But he was answer’d, That those Places were taken either
before the ten years Peace was concluded with the <i>Portuguese</i>, or before the King
approv’d of it, or at least before it was publish’d.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Grave Maurice</i> finding that he could not prevail by fair means with the <i>Portuguese</i>
in <i>Brasile</i>, sought to do something by force of Arms, because the welfare of the <i>West-India</i>
Company depended solely upon the fortune of War; his Design lay towards
the South Sea, whither the Ships might the easier Sail from <i>Brasile</i> through the
<i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i> or <i>Le Maire</i>, because in the Summer there blow for the most
part Northern Winds along the Coast of <i>America</i>. There were likewise many good
Conveniences in the Southern Ocean, not onely to surprize the rich <i>Manilha</i> Traders
but also to meet with the <i>Peruvian</i> Plate-Fleet; besides which, Enquiries
might be made with little Charges, if any Place were fit to Settle on for Trade in
the unknown South Land.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A great Deluge in <i>Brasile</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Year 1641. was not onely remarkable for the <i>Portugueses</i> revolting from
the <i>Spaniards</i>, but also for a great Deluge, which did much hurt in <i>Brasile</i>; for the
Rains fell so exceeding hard without ceasing, that the swoln Rivers every where
overflow’d their Banks and Dams; the Plants were either wash’d away, or were
eaten up by little Worms, which bred as soon as the Water began to fall. Besides
this Plague, the Small-pox also rag’d amongst the People, of which many dy’d,
and others lay lingring a great while. The Sugar-Mills likewise stood still for
want of <i>Negro</i>’s, which the Distemper had for the most part destroy’d, and the Sugar-Canes
rotted in the Ground.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Peace agreed on between the <i>States</i> of <i>Holland</i> and the King of <i>Portugal</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Man while <i>Grave Maurice</i> receiv’d news of the Agreement between the King of
<i>Portugal</i> and the <i>States</i> of the <i>United Netherlands</i>, according to which every one was to
keep what they had gotten by the War; Trading was free for all; against all the
Castles and Fortresses in <i>America</i>, under the King of <i>Spain</i>’s Dominion, Hostility was
to be acted alike by both; the Countrey which lay between the utmost Borders of
the <i>Portuguese</i> and <i>Netherlanders</i>, were to be divided, that each might know their just
Limits; all manner of Trade to the <i>Spanish America</i> was forbidden to both; each
Owner was to remain in possession of the Goods which he had on the Day when
this ten years Peace was proclaim’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Tolner</i> gives the <i>West-India</i> Company an Account of the state of Affairs in <i>Brasile</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Grave Maurice</i> seeing he could not get the <i>States</i> Consent to return home, sent
his Secretary <i>Tolner</i> to <i>Holland</i>, to inform the <i>West-India</i> Company of the Condition
of <i>Brasile</i>, and to request such things as were wanting there: <i>Tolner</i> accordingly arriving
in <i>Holland</i>, acquainted them with the Extent of their Dominions in <i>Brasile</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_576'>576</span>which reach’d from <i>Maragnan</i> to the River <i>Real</i>; with the necessity of keeping the
Soldiery undisbanded, in regard the <i>Portuguese</i> were ready to take all advantages,
notwithstanding the Articles of Agreement; with the discontent of their own
Men, and their readiness to mutiny upon the report that they were to be Disbanded;
with the great Inconveniences of altering the Government of the <i>West-India</i>
Company; with the number of Soldiers wherewith every Place belonging
to the Company was at that present furnish’d, which amounted in all to near five
thousand Men; and with the impossibility of keeping those Places, unless a speedy
Supply of Men and Provisions were sent.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Grave Maurice</i> receiv’d a Letter from <i>Mascarenhas</i>, wherein he made great complaint
of the <i>Netherlanders</i> Actions on <i>Loando</i>, St. <i>Thomas</i>, and <i>Maragnan</i>, during the
time of the Treaty, and us’d many Arguments for the delivering back of the Places
then taken; but <i>Maurice</i> took little notice of the said Letter, being busie about
setling all Affairs in this quiet Juncture of time: He freed all new Planters from
the paying of Tenths for seven years, sold several Fields to be Cultivated, repair’d
all decay’d Forts, kept the <i>Catholicks</i> in strict awe, ordain’d good Orders for Schools,
Alms-houses, and payment of Money, and gave particularly Liberty to the <i>Portuguese</i>
both in Spiritual and Temporal Affairs.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fort <i>Calvaria</i> taken by the <i>Maragnans</i> and others.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the mean time sad news was brought, <i>viz.</i> That the <i>Maragnans</i>, assisted by
the <i>Portugueses</i> and <i>Brasilians</i>, had taken the Fort of <i>Calvaria</i> near the River <i>Tapicuru</i>,
destroy’d all those that were in Garrison, and Storm’d the City <i>Lodowick</i>: Whereupon
<i>Hinderson</i> was dispatch’d thither immediately with three hundred <i>Netherlanders</i>,
and two hundred <i>Brasilians</i> from <i>Siara</i>; which the Enemy hearing, though
there were seven hundred <i>Portugueses</i>, and three thousand <i>Brasilians</i>, left the Island
<i>Maragnan</i>, and went over to the Main Continent.</p>

<p class='c010'>The occasion of this Plot was imputed to the fault of the sottish Governor of
St. <i>Lodowick</i>, and his Secretary <i>William Negenton</i>, who by their Folly and Misgovernment
provok’d the Natives to Rebellion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Grave Maurice</i> his Design upon <i>Buenos Aires</i> diverted by <i>Pirez</i> his taking of <i>Pavaosa</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the interim <i>Grave Maurice</i> had a Design upon the City <i>Buenos Aires</i> in the Southern
parts of <i>Brasile</i>, near the River <i>La Plata</i>, where a Way leads by Land to <i>Peru</i>;
and whither the Silver and <i>Negro</i>’s were often brought, especially when any Ships
were suspected to block up the Channel of <i>Panama</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whilest <i>Maurice</i> was preparing for this Expedition, news was brought that two
Ships had Landed their Men on the Island St. <i>Thomas</i>, under the Command of <i>Laurence
Pirez</i>, who had driven the  <i>Netherland</i> Garrison out of <i>Pavaosa</i>, and Besieg’d
the Fort, out of which many for want of Water ran to the Enemy; and it was fear’d
that the same Misfortune would suddenly befall the City <i>Loando</i> and <i>Seregippe del
Rey</i>; which prevented <i>Henrick Borer</i>’s Expedition to <i>Chili</i>, and <i>Lichthart</i>’s to <i>Buenos
Aires</i>, and so alarm’d <i>Grave Maurice</i>, that he thought it expedient to give speedy notice
thereof, to warn the  <i>Netherlanders</i> on <i>Angola</i>, that they should keep strict
Watches, and beware of the treacherous <i>Portuguese</i>, who affirm’d, That it was
lawful for them during the ten years Peace, to re-take those Places which had been
taken from them during the Treaty of Peace in the <i>Hague</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the <i>Palmares</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>These Proceedings forc’d <i>Grave Maurice</i> to Disarm most of them; and because the
<i>Negro</i>’s did much mischief from the <i>Palmares</i>, especially to the Husbandmen in the
<i>Alagoas</i>, <i>Maurice</i> gave order to destroy their Habitations. The <i>Palmares</i> were two
Villages, built along the River <i>Gungohuby</i> under close Woods, six Leagues Northwardly
from <i>Parayba</i>: The Inhabitants of them, being then about six thousand in
number, were most of them fled <i>Negro</i>’s, who gathering together in a Head, destroy’d
all the Countrey thereabouts: They dwelt in Huts of Boughs and Straw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_577'>577</span>interwoven; behind which were Gardens and Orchards of Palm-Trees, and conform’d
to the Religion and Government of the <i>Portuguese</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Grave Maurice</i> countersollicited by Agents from the king of <i>Congo</i> and Duke of <i>Sonho</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Whilest three hundred Musquetteers, a hundred <i>Mameluks</i>, and seven hundred
<i>Brasilians</i> were fitting to go to the <i>Palmares</i>, there arriv’d <i>Agents</i> at <i>Reciffa</i> from the
King of <i>Congo</i>, who brought as a Present to <i>Grave Maurice</i>, two hundred <i>Negro</i>’s, a
Golden Collar and Pot, besides many <i>Negro</i>’s for the <i>West-India</i> Company. These
Agents desir’d Aid against the Duke of <i>Sonho</i>, who treacherously Plotted to drive
the King out of <i>Congo</i>; which Plot was discover’d by scatter’d Letters, Sign’d by
the Governors and Bishop at <i>Loando</i>, a little before <i>Loando</i> was taken by the <i>Hollanders</i>.
<i>Maurice</i> courteously Entertaining the Agents, proffer’d himself to be a Mediator
to decide the Difference, and gave them a long Velvet Coat Lac’d with Gold
and Silver Lace, a Silk Coat and Scarf, and a Beaver Hat with a Golden Edging.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not long after there came Agents from <i>Sonho</i>, to beseech <i>Grave Maurice</i> that he
would not assist the King of <i>Congo</i>; one of whom went to the <i>Hague</i>, and was follow’d
by two from the King of <i>Congo</i>, who open’d their Letters before the Prince
of <i>Orange</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Agents from <i>Congo</i>, what kind of Men.</div>

<p class='c010'>The two Agents from <i>Congo</i> were strong and black Men, very active, and having
grim Countenances; they Danc’d after a strange manner; and showing the Picture
of their King sitting in great State, acted the Postures in which his Nobles and

able with ease to carry each of them two hundred thirty five Pound weight: their
Ornamentals consisted of <i>Elephants</i> Tails.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Alvares de la Benho</i> his Complaint to <i>Grave Maurice</i> of his Country-men.</div>

<p class='c010'>In <i>Loando</i> the Governor for the <i>Dutch</i>, nam’d <i>Cornelis Niewland</i>, and the <i>Portuguese</i>
Governor <i>Peter Cæsar de Meneses</i>, came to this Agreement, That since the ten years
Peace was concluded on between the <i>Portuguese</i> and <i>Netherlanders</i>, <i>Meneses</i> should
possess the Countrey wash’d by the River <i>Bengo</i>, and call in the ancient Natives to
live and Trade as formerly; all which was faithfully perform’d: nay, <i>Meneses</i> furnish’d
<i>Niewland</i> with as much Meal as he requir’d, towards the maintaining of a
thousand <i>Negro</i>’s, whom he had bought; and the <i>Hollanders</i> and <i>Portugueses</i> began
now to be every day more and more friendly and familiar with each other, when
on a sudden <i>Niewland</i> not onely remembring what was done lately on the Islands
<i>Maragnan</i> and St. <i>Thomas</i>, but also stirr’d up by other later Actions, which gave him
occasion of jealousie, sent two hundred Musquetteers in the Night from <i>Loando</i>,
to take the Governor <i>Meneses</i>, with some others, who he fear’d might make an Insurrection.
The Soldiers accordingly about Day-break fell unawares upon the
sleeping <i>Portugueses</i>, kill’d forty of them, and carry’d <i>Meneses</i> and many other Persons
of Quality away Prisoners, together with a Booty valu’d at above ten thousand
<i>Ducats</i>, and sent a hundred and sixty <i>Portugueses</i> in an old leaky Vessel to St. <i>Salvador</i>;
but they being toss’d to and again at Sea for a considerable time, eight of
them dy’d, the rest almost starv’d, Landed on <i>Pernambuco</i>; where <i>Simon Alvares de la
Benho</i> being amaz’d to see his Countrey-men thus hardly dealt with, complain’d
of <i>Niewland</i>, <i>Mols</i>, and <i>Cross</i>, who were the chief of <i>Loando</i>, that they had broke the
Laws, and the sworn Articles of Peace; urging that it would be very unjust that
the poor <i>Portugueses</i> should not have Satisfaction for the Wrong which they had
sustain’d, as also for the loss of their Goods. To which <i>Grave Maurice</i> answer’d,
“That <i>Loando</i> belong’d to the <i>West-India</i> Company, and that for his part he had nothing
to do with that City, but that if the <i>States</i> were acquainted therewith,
they would without doubt be highly concern’d at it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Christopher Santches</i>, a free <i>Negro</i>, gave information of the sad Condition of the
Island St. <i>Thomas</i>, <i>viz.</i> That the greatest part of the <i>Hollanders</i> that had been left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_578'>578</span>upon that Island being dead, <i>Pirez</i> hereupon with the King’s Consent fitted out
two Ships, and setting Sail from <i>Lisbon</i> about the beginning of <i>July</i> 1642. first refus’d
to pay the usual Custom at the Island St. <i>Thomas</i>, afterwards fell upon the
<i>Hollanders</i>, whom he Besieg’d in the Castle, and against the Law of Arms poyson’d
all the Waters.</p>

<p class='c010'>To prevent the future Inconveniences that were likely to arise from a Famine
which about this time afflicted the whole Countrey of <i>Brasile, Grave Maurice</i> judg’d
it convenient to sell the Lands in the <i>Alagoas</i> to new Planters; to which purpose
<i>Henrick Moucheron</i> was chosen Overseer, to take care that all the Fields about <i>Porto
Calvo</i>, and along the River <i>Francisco</i>, as also in the <i>Alagoas</i>, should be Sow’n with
Bread-Corn.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Grave Maurice</i> takes his leave of the several Governors in <i>Brasile</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Grave Maurice</i> obtaining leave at last to go home, took Leave by Letters of
the Governors of <i>Serinhain</i>, <i>Porto Calvo</i>, <i>Iguarazua</i>, <i>Itamaraca</i>, <i>Parayba</i>, <i>Rio Grande</i>, and in
Person of the Council at <i>Reciffa</i>, who all thank’d him for his prudent Government,
manifesting their hearty sorrow for his departure, <i>Which without doubt would produce
many Inconveniences</i>. But though the Council of the <i>West-India</i> Company had order’d
him to return home about the beginning of <i>March</i> 1643. yet he went not so
soon, because he was to reduce the number of <i>Militia</i> to eighteen Companies, and
also to settle the Revenues, and dispose of Offices, in which he found much trouble;
wherefore before his departure he wrote to the <i>States</i> of the <i>United Netherlands</i>,
assuring them how impossible it was to defend <i>Brasile</i>, which extended some hundreds
of Leagues, with so small a number of Men, since the <i>Portuguese</i> cover’d inward
malice under a feigned shew of kindness, and at the same time watch’d all
opportunities to drive the <i>Netherlanders</i> from their Plantations, being very much exasperated
by the priviledge of Religion granted to the <i>Jews</i>, whilest their Monks and
Jesuits were banish’d. Moreover, in regard they ow’d the <i>West-India</i> Company
above fifty nine Tuns of Gold, they sought to cancel that Obligation, by making
themselves Masters of whatsoever their Creditors had in <i>Brasile</i>, so that there was
no way but to keep them under by force of Arms.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>He leaves the Government and returns home.</div>

<p class='c010'>After <i>Grave Maurice</i> had sent this Letter to <i>Holland</i>, he left the Government of
<i>Brasile</i> to the chief Council, the <i>Militia</i> to <i>Henrick Hoes</i>, Captain of his Life-guard,
with Directions for Governing after his departure. Having setled all things in
good order, he went from <i>Maurice-stadt</i> through <i>Paratibi</i> and <i>Iguarazu</i> to <i>Parayba</i>;
where <i>Janduy</i> sent him three of his Sons, with twenty <i>Tapuyans</i>, desiring him not to
go away; two of them with several <i>Carapates</i> and <i>Waypebarans</i>, (a People who made
themselves Masters of the great <i>Palmares</i>) and five other <i>Brasilians</i> went aboard with
him on the twentieth of <i>May</i> 1644.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Fleet, consisting of thirteen Ships, and Mann’d with fourteen hundred
Men of all sorts, was laden with so many Merchandizes as were valu’d at twenty
six Tuns of Gold; with which <i>Grave Maurice</i> arriving at the <i>Texel</i>, Landed at the
<i>Helder</i>, and gave an Account of his Government in <i>Brasile</i>, and of the then present
state of that part of it which belong’d to the <i>West-India</i> Company.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ill management of Affairs after <i>Maurice</i> his departure.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Viera</i>’s Treachery.</div>

<p class='c010'>After <i>Grave Maurice</i>’s departure, <i>Hamel</i>, <i>Bassi</i>, and <i>Bullestraet</i>, bore the chief Command
in <i>Brasile</i>: The Charges made by the War were mitigated, and the number
of the Soldiers in Garrison reduc’d to sixteen hundred; some Forts lay without a
Man in them, whilest the King of <i>Portugal</i> watch’d for such an opportunity; for
he seem’d to be as much concern’d for that Countrey, as for his Kingdom of <i>Portugal</i>,
and the rather, because his Predecessor <i>Sebastian</i> receiv’d above forty hundred
thousand <i>Ducats</i> yearly out of the same, besides the Presents and other Gains made
by the <i>Portuguese</i>; wherefore he gave order to the Governor of St. <i>Salvador</i> to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_579'>579</span>very vigilant, and assur’d him, that in a short time he would send him both Men
and Provisions. A <i>Mulatto</i> call’d <i>John Fernandes Viera</i>, did not a little assist the <i>Portuguese</i>
in their Design; for he having liv’d a considerable time in a Councellors House
in <i>Reciffa</i>, had narrowly observ’d all Passages, and insinuated himself into several
Statesmens Affairs, by Presenting them now and then with some Rarities, insomuch
that he came in time to Farm the Rents which the <i>West-India</i> Company receiv’d
from the Sugar-Mills; but at length being discontented because the Council
would not make any abatement upon the same, when he complain’d that he lost
by Farming the fore-mention’d Tax, he held private Correspondence with <i>Andreas
Vidal</i>, that when a convenient opportunity presented it self for the <i>Portuguese</i> to fall
on the <i>Hollanders</i>, he might be assisting; to which end he had gotten several Arms
and Ammunition together.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this Plot a <i>Jew</i> nam’d <i>Moses Accoignes</i>, living in <i>Viera</i>’s House, a League from
<i>Reciffa</i>, to keep him from Arrests, was perswaded to joyn, which he seemingly promis’d
to do; but went away by Day-break, and discover’d the Design to the Privy-Council,
who being rock’d asleep by the <i>Portugueses</i> fair Pretences, gave no credit
to the Relation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Plot against the <i>Netherlanders</i> to be carry’d on by a Wedding.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Plot discover’d by some of the Conspirators.</div>

<p class='c010'>For the better carrying on of this Design, <i>Cavalcantelca</i>, Provost-Marshal in
<i>Maurice-stadt</i> made a great Wedding for his Daughter in <i>Viera</i>’s House, to which the
chiefest Persons of Quality, both of the <i>Portuguese</i>, and also all the Privy-Councellors
and Military Officers belonging to the <i>West-India</i> Company were invited:
and the Plot was so contriv’d, that whilest they were all at Dinner, the <i>Portuguese</i>
were suddenly to fall upon the <i>Netherlanders</i> and kill them, both Servants and Masters;
this done, some were to go to <i>Reciffa</i> or <i>Maurice-stadt</i>, with news that the
Wedding People were coming; whereupon part were to press into the City, others
to keep the Gates, till all their Forces were come thither, which then might easily
secure and seize upon the Magazine: some Barques also under pretence of loading
Sugar, were in the mean time to set upon the Haven and Fort near the Shore. All
things were accordingly prepar’d for the Wedding, nothing being wanting that
could be purchas’d with Money, and near the Forts of <i>Rio Grande</i> and <i>Parayba</i> were
Stage-plays to be Acted in publick, it being concluded that the Soldiers in Garrison
would certainly be there to see them; the Actors being privately Arm’d with
Pistols and Ponyards. And to oblige one another the more for the carrying on of
this bloody Design, <i>Viera</i> had caus’d the chief Conspirators to take an Oath before
the high Altar. The twenty fourth of <i>June</i> 1645. was the Day on which this Tragedy
was to be acted; but a few days before two <i>Portugueses</i> and five <i>Jews</i>, who had
been sworn Confederates, their Consciences checking them for so villanous an
Undertaking, made an ingenuous Discovery of the Plot. The Councellor <i>Moucheron</i>
was also inform’d, that the <i>Portuguese</i> Colonel <i>Camaron</i> and <i>Diez</i> were coming with
great Forces from St. <i>Salvador</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Viera</i> flies into the Wood.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Council when they might easily have apprehended <i>Viera</i>, sent for him by a
<i>Jew</i> call’d <i>Abraham Coing</i>, under pretence of Treating about some Business concerning
the <i>West-India</i> Company; he promis’d to come in the Evening, but suspecting
he was betray’d, fled into the Woods, and gave speedy notice to all his Accomplices,
who follow’d him in great numbers. The Soldiers sent to search <i>Viera</i>’s
House, found none but old Men and Children.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Councellor <i>Van Houten</i> went immediately with seven Sugar-Vessels to <i>Parayba</i>,
fortifi’d the Forts <i>Margareta</i>, <i>Restringa</i>, and <i>Antonio</i>, and made room for the
<i>Brasilians</i> that had remov’d thither from their Villages, in the Houses deserted by
the <i>Portuguese</i> in <i>Frederick-stadt</i>. On the other side, <i>Amador da Rouge</i>, one of the Conspirators,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_580'>580</span>went with a Company from <i>Poiouca</i> through the Countrey, kill’d seven
<i>Dutch</i> Seamen, with three <i>Jews</i>, and erected Gibbets, on which he threatned to hang
all those who did not take up Arms for the King of <i>Portugal</i>. Colonel <i>Hous</i> inform’d
hereof march’d with five hundred Men to <i>Poiuca</i> to meet the <i>Portuguese</i>,
who were scatter’d up and down the neighboring Woods. He also publish’d an
Edict, in which every one was Licens’d to return to their Habitations, with promise
of pardon for their Rebellion, if they would take the Oath of Allegiance anew,
onely <i>Viera</i>, <i>Cavalcantelca</i>, and <i>Da Rouge</i>, were excluded, and nine thousand <i>Guilders</i>
promis’d to those that brought them dead or alive, which made two hundred Inhabitants
in <i>Reciffa</i> march into the Countrey under the Command of Captain <i>Blar</i>,
to find the fore-mention’d Traitors; and at last joyning with <i>Hous</i>, they pursu’d
the fled <i>Portuguese</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Hoogenstraet</i> sent to Treat with <i>Antonio Silva</i>, is privately tempted by him to deliver up the Fort <i>St. Augustine</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the mean time the Council sent the Captains <i>Vander Voort</i> and <i>Hoogenstraet</i>, to
<i>Antonio Silva</i>, Governor of St. <i>Salvador</i>, to acquaint him with the treacherous Insurrection
of the <i>Portuguese</i>, and of <i>Camaron</i> and <i>Diez</i> coming from St. <i>Salvador</i> to their
assistance, urging, that these treacherous Proceedings and breach of Oath, could
not but redound to the dishonor of the Crown of <i>Portugal</i>. Whereto <i>Silva</i> answer’d,
“That <i>Camaron</i> and <i>Diez</i> were not under any Obligation of Oath, but
that he would check the Insurrection in <i>Pernambuco</i>, and take care that the Authors
thereof should make Satisfaction to the <i>West-India</i> Company.” Notwithstanding
which fair Pretences, he so wrought with <i>Hoogenstraet</i>, that after a private
Conference between them it was agreed, that for a certain sum of Money he should
surrender him the Promontory of St. <i>Augustine</i>, of which he was Governor; but at
his Return to <i>Reciffa</i> being made chief Commander of the Castle there, and being
jealous what might follow his private Treating with <i>Silva</i>, he declar’d to the
Council, that <i>Silva</i> had desir’d him to surrender the Fort St. <i>Augustine</i>, which he had
granted, for no other end, but to catch the false <i>Portuguese</i> in their own Nets, and
to trapan all such as should be sent to take possession of it; and that if the Council
had any suspicion of him, they might make use of his Service in some other place.</p>

<p class='c010'>About this time a hundred and fifty <i>Tapuyans</i>, led by a <i>German</i> Soldier call <i>Jacob
Rabbi</i>, Sallying out of their Woods, fell upon the great Village <i>Conyahou</i>, under the
Jurisdiction of <i>Rio Grande</i>, broke into the Church, murder’d all the <i>Portuguese</i>, and
eating their raw Flesh, demolish’d the Place.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Hous</i> also unfortunately Storm’d the Mountain <i>Santantan</i>, where the Enemy lay
Intrench’d, being forc’d to Retreat with the loss of above a hundred Men, amongst
whom was Captain <i>Lo</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Grave Maurice</i> his stately Palace demolish’d.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Privy Council caus’d a part of <i>Maurice-stadt</i> to be pull’d down, as also the
stately Palace <i>Freyburgh</i>, for which the <i>Jews</i> proffer’d <i>Grave Maurice</i> 6000 <i>l.</i> together
with the stately Garden, which were thought to exceed the famous Gardens in
<i>Thessalia</i>; but on the other side they kept Men at work Night and Day in repairing
the decay’d Castle at <i>Reciffa</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Bonavides</i> appears with a great Fleet before <i>Reciffa</i>, but pretends Friendship.</div>

<p class='c010'>About the same time the Admiral <i>Salvador Correo de Bonavides</i>, brought thirty
four great Sail of Ships to an Anchor before <i>Reciffa</i>, the Gallion which he Commanded
carrying sixty Brass Guns. The Admiral <i>Lichthart</i> ran to meet him with
five Vessels, and sent him word, that if he fell down to Leeward, since he was got
to the Windward, he should soon find, that five Ships durst Engage with a Fleet six
times as strong. Whereupon <i>Bonavides</i> sent two Messengers to <i>Lichthart</i> to tell him,
that he came as a Friend to damp the <i>Portuguese</i> Insurrection in <i>Pernambuco</i>; to
which purpose he had already Landed some Companies at <i>Tamandera</i>. <i>Lichthart</i> sending
the two Messengers to the Council at <i>Reciffa</i>, they sent two of their own Members
to <i>Bonavides</i>, desiring to know of him what call’d him thither with so great a
Fleet, and without giving the least notice, contrary to the concluded Peace of ten
years?</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Whilest the two Commissioners went with the fore-mention’d Orders to the
<i>Portuguese</i> Fleet, a <i>Netherland</i> Vessel endeavor’d, notwithstanding the Wind was contrary,
to get out to <i>Lichthart</i>’s assistance; which <i>Bonavides</i> observing, stood away
Northerly before the Wind: but <i>Lichthart</i> overtook a Ketch belonging to the <i>Portuguese</i>
Fleet.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Serinhain</i> taken by <i>Vidal</i> and others.</div>

<p class='c010'>Mean while the <i>Portuguese</i> upon Land being two thousand strong, under the
Command of <i>Vidal</i>, <i>Diez</i>, <i>Camaron</i>, and <i>Acoignes</i>, Storm’d the Fort <i>Serinhain</i>, where
the <i>French</i> Captain <i>Montagne</i> could make but little resistance, not having above forty
Men, and being unprovided of Ammunition and Provision; yet he resisted nine
days, and at last got two Barques to convey him to <i>Reciffa</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Soon after this the <i>Portuguese</i> Fleet falling out amongst themselves, <i>Bonavides</i>
Steer’d back for <i>Lisbon</i> with a few Ships, the rest coming to an Anchor again near
<i>Reciffa</i>; where the Seamen whom <i>Lichthart</i> had taken inform’d him, that their
Fleet came the first time to <i>Reciffa</i> for no other end, but to stir up the <i>Portuguese</i> by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_582'>582</span>their Presence to take up Arms, according to a private Contract, having to that
purpose Landed twelve hundred Men at <i>Tamandera</i>, besides the Army led by <i>Camaron</i>
and <i>Diez</i> from St. <i>Salvador</i> to <i>Pernambuco</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Colonel <i>Hous</i> about this time being sent for back to <i>Reciffa</i>, and staying with
five hundred Men for Captain <i>Blaek</i>’s coming, who was sent to fetch all the <i>Portuguese</i>
Women within three Leagues about <i>Reciffa</i>, was set upon in the Night by
<i>Vidal</i> with two thousand <i>Portugueses</i>; the <i>Brasilians</i>, who were above half his Forces,
flying into the Woods, leaving onely two hundred <i>Netherlanders</i> to fight with <i>Vidal</i>,
by whom being so much over-power’d, they were forc’d to submit to his mercy,
and suffer themselves to be all carry’d Prisoners to St. <i>Salvador</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>By this time at <i>Reciffa</i> all things were in a confusion, the Pits digg’d about
<i>Maurice-stadt</i> afforded nothing but brackish Water, which occasion’d Sickness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fort St. <i>Augustine</i> treacherously surrendered by <i>Hoogenstraet</i> to the <i>Portuguese</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Vidal</i> encourag’d by his Victory, march’d to St. <i>Augustine</i>, where without doubt
he had stopt, if <i>Hoogenstraet</i>, who had the chief Command of the Fort, had not been
Disloyal; for this Traitor thought it not enough to surrender this invincible Fort to
the Enemy, but also bereav’d <i>Reciffa</i> of Provisions and Ammunition, which he did
very subtilly, sending earnestly thither for Souldiers, Bullets, Powder and Shot,
in lieu whereof he sent thither two Barques full of old Men, Women and Children,
that so he might deprive <i>Reciffa</i> of stout Men, and supply their room with unable
People. For this treacherous and villanous Act the <i>Portuguese</i> were to give him
1800 <i>l.</i> and make him a Colonel: Moreover, all the Soldiers in Garrison, consisting
of three hundred Men, receiv’d 3 <i>l.</i> a Man, and were sent to joyn with a
Regiment of six hundred and fifty Men, over which <i>Hoogenstraet</i> was made chief
Commander.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lichthart</i> gains a noble Victory over the <i>Portuguese</i> Fleet.</div>

<p class='c010'>The day before this eminent Castle was to be deliver’d up to the Enemy, Admiral
<i>Lichthart</i> obtain’d a brave Victory at Sea; for the <i>Portuguese</i> Fleet (consisting
of seventeen Sail, the rest being gone with <i>Bonavides</i> to <i>Portugal</i>) anchoring before
<i>Tamandera</i>, were valiantly set upon by <i>Lichthart</i>, who Engag’d with them on the
ninth of <i>September</i> 1645. with the <i>Utrecht</i>, being the Admiral Ship, the <i>Zealand</i>, <i>Ter
Veer</i>, <i>Over-Ysel</i>, the Pinks <i>Salt-Land</i> and <i>Leyden</i>, a Dogger and three Barques. In the
Hole of the Haven <i>Tamandera</i> three <i>Portuguese</i> Carvels kept Watch, and near a Battery
full of Guns lay three Barques, and the other Ships a little farther nigh the
Shore. The Enemy at first shot very fiercely from the Battery, whilest the Ships
drove to the Shore, and the Men leaping overboard swam ashore, onely the
Admiral <i>Jeronymo Serao de Payva</i> made some resistance, but at last surrendred up his
Ship, the <i>Netherlanders</i> in their Barques killing above seven hundred <i>Portugueses</i> in
the Water. <i>Lichthart</i> burnt the whole Fleet, except the Admiral and Vice-Admiral,
which he carry’d to <i>Reciffa</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>But this Victory was not comparable to the Loss which the <i>East-India</i> Company
sustain’d by the selling of the Promontory of St. <i>Augustine</i>, and the taking of the
Forts <i>Porto Calvo</i> and <i>Rio Francisco</i>; to the last whereof the Barques coming too late
to carry the Soldiers off, they were all made Prisoners by the <i>Portuguese</i>, as also the
Planters, in all to the number of five hundred.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Bouilloux</i> put to Death by the Governor of <i>Parayba</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Vidal</i> marching to <i>Tamarica</i>, Storm’d <i>Schuppen-stadt</i>, but found such resistance from
<i>George Garstman</i> (who supply’d the Prisoner <i>Hous</i> his Place) that he lost three hundred
Men: After which he endeavor’d by means of <i>Fernandes Bouilloux</i>, to purchase
the Fort <i>Margareta</i> for 1500 l. <i>Sterl.</i> of the Governor of <i>Parayba</i>, who immediately
without any farther Examination, caus’d <i>Bouilloux</i> that proffer’d the Money to be
put to death.</p>

<p class='c010'>A <i>Dutch</i> Sergeant in <i>Olinda</i> dealt very treacherously; for he sold the Fort to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_583'>583</span><i>Portuguese</i> Ensign for 100 <i>l.</i> and also most basely betray’d all his Soldiers Lives to
the merciless Enemy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The distressed Condition of <i>Reciffa</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>By these means <i>Reciffa</i> was round about in jeopardy, as also within; for the great
Thirst of the Inhabitants under a scorching Climate, augmented by the <i>Hollanders</i>
salt Meat, could not be quench’d with brackish Water, for fresh was not to be had;
Famine also increas’d daily, insomuch that the Poor threatned to fall upon the
Rich, which made the Magistrates go Arm’d from House to House, to enquire
what Store every one had, which being writ down was carry’d away and put into
the Store-houses, where each receiv’d alike share, without respect of Persons. Fewel
also grew very scarce, which made many eat their Meat raw, or half dress’d. In
the interim every one that was able, was forc’d to work at the Forts of <i>Reciffa</i>,
which were beaten down by the Rains; and the Soldiers continually alarm’d by
the Enemy, were forc’d to be Night and Day up in Arms. The People dy’d more
and more daily, when two Fly-Boats arriv’d there with Provisions, and News,
that a Fleet was coming to their assistance.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Captains <i>Rhynbag</i> and <i>Montagne</i> went in the Night, each with a Company,
to fall upon the Enemy, who being two thousand five hundred strong, drove them
back, and pursu’d them within shot of the <i>Afogados</i>, where forty <i>Portugueses</i> were
kill’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the same time a <i>Terra Neuf</i> Sailor, laden with the dry’d Fish <i>Bocraillo</i>,
came to <i>Reciffa</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In <i>Parayba</i> three hundred <i>Netherlanders</i> Sallying out of the Forts, fell so valiantly
upon nine hundred <i>Portugueses</i>, that they forc’d them to flye, not without a considerable
loss. After which a Party of <i>Brasilians</i> surpris’d eighty <i>Portugueses</i>, as they
were at <i>Mass</i> in <i>Andreas Diez de la Figuereda</i>’s Sugar-Mills, where they spar’d none
but <i>Figuereda</i>’s Daughter, whose Beauty so charm’d them, that they comforted her
mourning for her Father’s Death, and deliver’d her undefil’d to the Governor
of <i>Parayba</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The barbarous Cruelty of <i>Vidal</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Vidal</i> raging for madness because now and then some of his Prisoners escap’d,
caus’d several of them to be cruelly murder’d, tying some of them Back to Back, and
then cutting them in pieces; others he threw with Stones ty’d about their Necks
into the Rivers; others he ty’d by their Privities, and hung them upon Trees; and
also knock’d out the Brains of others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Soldiers at <i>Reciffa</i> mutiny for want of Provision.</div>

<p class='c010'>In <i>Reciffa</i> the Soldiers, consisting of divers Nations, began likewise to mutiny,
crying, <i>They should be all starv’d</i>; and saying, <i>They had better be slain in the Field fighting
against the  Enemy, than die of Hunger in the City</i>. They also complain’d, <i>The Commissioners
themselves betray</i> Brasile; and threatned by force to fetch the Provisions out
of the publick Stores, saying, <i>They had long enough endur’d Thirst and Hunger</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A new Fleet sent by the <i>States</i> to <i>Brasile</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Dutch</i> Fleet set out for <i>Brasile</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>These Transactions in <i>Brasile</i> were very ill resented in <i>Holland</i>, the common
People in the <i>Hague</i> being ready to pull down the <i>Portuguese</i> Ambassador’s House,
in revenge of the Cruelties exercis’d upon the <i>Netherlanders</i> in <i>Brasile</i>, had they not
been hindred by the Prudence of Prince <i>Henrick</i>. The Ambassador pretending to
be ignorant of the fore-mention’d Passages, proffer’d to make what Satisfaction the
<i>West-India</i> Company should require. But the <i>States</i> not satisfi’d with Excuses,
when the Actions plainly manifested what their Intentions were, Complain’d to the
<i>French</i> King of the unthankful and malicious Dealings of the <i>Portuguese</i> Crown;
and meeting but with small Redress, they prepar’d to right themselves by force of
Arms, and to that end rais’d several Regiments of Land-Soldiers, besides Seamen,
to send to <i>Brasile</i>. The Fleet design’d thither, consisting of twenty two Sail, after
it had been frozen up before <i>Flushing</i> three Moneths, set Sail at last in the beginning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_584'>584</span>of <i>February</i>, Anno 1646. with the Lord <i>Schonenburgh</i>, a Member of the <i>States</i>, the
Councellor <i>Goch</i>, and Treasurer <i>Beaumond</i>, Men very well experienc’d in Governing
of Countreys: To these were added the eminent Merchants of <i>Amsterdam</i>, <i>Haeks</i>
and <i>Trovire</i>, to keep the <i>West-India</i> Companies Accounts, and <i>Le Heremiet</i> for their
Secretary. <i>Sigismond Schuppe</i> bore the chief Command over the <i>Militia</i>, and the
Admiral <i>Bankert</i> over the Fleet, which suffer’d the greatest hardship imaginable;
for being driven by tempestuous Winds into the <i>Downs</i>, two of them driving from
their Anchors were cast away on the <i>Flats</i>. The Fleet getting out again, was once
more forc’d by a Storm to put in at the <i>Isle of Wight</i>; from whence by reason of continual
Gusts they could not stir in nine Weeks time. During this tedious waiting
for a fair Wind, the <i>Brasile</i> Frigat, valu’d at 20000 <i>l.</i> was split in pieces against a
Rock of the Island, and of three hundred Men thirty onely were sav’d. A Pink,
which came in two Moneths from <i>Reciffa</i>, brought also sad tydings to the Fleet,
<i>viz.</i> That the Town was in such a Condition, that without doubt the Fleet would
come too late to their assistance: whereupon they making the more haste, endeavor’d,
not without great trouble, to weigh Anchor again, whilest the Wind rose
higher and higher, and the Waves going very hollow, drove the Ships down towards
<i>Portland</i> Coast, full of Rocks, to which they were so near, that they saw a <i>Scotch</i>man
split in pieces against them; and had not the Wind come about, and abated of
its fury, the Fleet had undoubtedly perish’d. No sooner was this Danger past, but
another succeeded; for the Soldiers in the Admirals Ship complaining of the small
allowance they had of Cheese, Brandy, and Tobacco, had made themselves Masters
of the Store-room, and threatned to kill the Lords <i>Goch</i> and <i>Beaumond</i>; but they,
assisted with Men from the other Ships, who came in at the Cabbin Windows, so
order’d the Mutineers, that they ask’d forgiveness, which for many Reasons was
granted, onely they were distributed by seven in a Ship throughout the whole
Fleet. After a great Contest between <i>Goch</i> and <i>Beaumond</i> about carrying the Flag,
which could not be decided, <i>Goch</i> was left by the rest of the Fleet, who Steer’d another
Course, and getting near the <i>Line</i>, lay becalm’d six days; in which time he
lost very many of his Men by a strange kind of <i>Scorbute</i> which rag’d amongst them;
at last Sailing along the Promontory of St. <i>Augustine</i>, he came to an Anchor before
<i>Reciffa</i>, which he found in the greatest Exigency imaginable, insomuch that it was
resolv’d upon, the next day to surrender the Place up to the <i>Portuguese</i>, on promise
of Quarter onely: which Resolution none oppos’d more than the <i>Jews</i>; for the
<i>Portuguese</i> swore that they would burn them alive, if ever they became Masters of
<i>Reciffa</i>, which made them resolve to die with the Sword in their Hands, and sell
their Lives at a dear rate. Six Weeks after <i>Gochs</i> Arrival, the remaining part of the
Fleet, escaping many dreadful Storms, in which, besides the two that were lost in
the <i>Downs</i>, they lost five Ships and five hundred Men, arriv’d also at <i>Reciffa</i>; where
the Commissioners appointed Officers to distribute to every one their certain allowance
of Victuals. The prime Councellor <i>Schonenburgh</i> also decided the Difference
between <i>Beaumond</i> and <i>Goch</i>, as also between <i>Haeks</i> and <i>Trovire</i>, about their Places
in the Assembly, <i>viz.</i> that they should sit above one another by Turns. The old
Governors, <i>Hamel</i>, <i>Bassi</i>, and <i>Bullestraet</i>, were blam’d by every one for the decay of
<i>Brasile</i>; and being sent to <i>Holland</i>, were receiv’d with frowning Looks, and rail’d
against in Pamphlets as faithless Persons, who sought nothing but their own advantage,
and were threatned to be call’d to an Account. It was also laid to their
charge, that they had not given a true Account of the State and Condition of <i>Brasile</i>;
that the State was much more decay’d than they had made known, by which means
the present Power prov’d too weak to do any thing to the Enemy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Garstman</i> Fin’d and Disgrac’d upon King <i>Dary</i>’s Complaint.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_585'>585</span>Amongst other Misfortunes which befell the <i>West-India</i> Company, the Revolt of
the <i>Tapuyans</i> and other <i>Brasilians</i> was not the least, which hapned upon the occasion
of <i>Garstman</i>’s putting to Death of <i>Jacob Rabbi</i>, a <i>German</i>, and indeed their chief
Ringleader in all Robberies and Villanies; but <i>Dary</i> their then King alledging
that <i>Rabbi</i> was wrongfully Executed by <i>Garstman</i>, and that his Tryal belong’d to
him as King, prosecuted <i>Garstman</i> so vigorously, that he and his Ensign <i>Jacob Boulan</i>,
his Accessory in the Fact, had their Goods and Salary confiscated, and they themselves
were sent home in disgrace.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Portuguese</i> Invitation prevails above the <i>Netherlanders</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Mean while the Council seeing that there was not much good to be done by
force of Arms, endeavor’d by mild ways to invite the revolted <i>Portugueses</i>, who
were all promis’d Pardon for their Insurrection in an Edict which was publish’d
in all places, onely <i>Viera</i>, <i>Almado</i>, <i>De Rouche</i>, <i>Antonio Calvantelca</i>, and <i>Hoogenstraet</i>, for
whom great sums of Money were offer’d, were excepted. The <i>Portuguese</i> on the
contrary publish’d, That they would receive all those <i>Netherlanders</i> into favor that
would come over to them, and pay the Debts which they ow’d to the <i>West-India</i>
Company, and also Transport them whither they pleas’d. These Promises, written
in <i>English</i>, <i>Dutch</i>, <i>French</i>, and <i>Portuguese</i>, and hung every where on the Boughs
of Trees, and other publick Places, operated much more than the Privy-Councils
Edicts; for in stead of one <i>Portuguese</i> that came to them, several ran to the <i>Portuguese</i>
from <i>Reciffa</i>, notwithstanding a strict Guard was kept to prevent them, besides
the great mortality amongst the Soldiers and Inhabitants through several raging
Distempers, and want of fresh Provisions: Which general Calamity, it seems,
very much cow’d the Spirits of those that were left; for in a Sally meeting with five
hundred <i>Portugueses</i>, notwithstanding they were equal in number, yet they made a
shameful Retreat; yea, though <i>Schuppe</i> came with eight hundred Men to their assistance,
yet he could not prevail with them to face about either by fair means or
foul, for with his own hand he Ran-through an Ensign, Sergeant, and two Soldiers,
who ran away first. Yet notwithstanding this base and cowardly Retreat, it was
resolv’d on to set upon <i>Olinda</i> and the Promontory St. <i>Augustine</i>; and at the same
time <i>Hinderson</i> was sent to make himself Master of <i>Rio Francisco</i> with fifteen hundred
Men, and to harrase all the Countrey thereabouts with Fire and Sword, that
so he might force the <i>Portuguese</i> to leave <i>Reciffa</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Revolt of the <i>Tapuyans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Though <i>John Dary</i>, King of the <i>Tapuyans</i>, seem’d well enough contented with the
punishment of <i>Garstman</i>, yet a great Party of his Subjects were not satisfi’d, but
went and joyn’d with the <i>Portuguese</i>, because <i>Garstman</i> had not been deliver’d to
them in <i>Siara</i>, where they kill’d all the <i>Netherlanders</i> they could meet with, and sent
Presents to their King <i>Dary</i>, if possible, to oblige him to joyn with the <i>Portuguese</i>:
But he reply’d, <i>That he had more reason to punish them for their ill usage of the Inhabitants in</i>
Siara, <i>than to have any thing to do with the</i> Portuguese.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Council inform’d hereof, sent the Interpreter <i>Ralph Baron</i>, who had a long
time Convers’d with the <i>Tapuyans</i>, with a Present of Axes, Knives, Looking-glasses,
Shirts, Combs, and the like Trifles, to King <i>Dary</i>, desiring him to continue his former
kindness towards the <i>Hollanders</i>; which <i>Dary</i> promis’d, provided he might receive
Assistance from <i>Reciffa</i> against those whom he had made his Enemies for the
<i>Netherlanders</i> sake; which <i>Baron</i> promis’d should be done as soon as the fresh Forces
which were daily expected from the <i>Texel</i>, <i>Maes</i>, and <i>Zealand</i>, came to <i>Brasile</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fort of <i>Rio Grande</i> taken by <i>Hinderson</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Capt. <i>Montagne</i> overpower’d by the Enemy, and slain.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Hinderson</i> Landing at <i>Rio Grande</i>, took the Fort without firing a Gun, the <i>Portuguese</i>
at his first coming flying into the Woods. He found here abundance of Cattel;
for no place in the World breeds more than this, several Husbandmen having fifteen
thousand Head of Beasts, of which many were taken to supply the want of Provisions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_586'>586</span>at <i>Reciffa</i>. As soon as he had taken the Fort, he caus’d it to be pull’d down
to the Ground, because it stood in an inconvenient place, and immediately rais’d
another, which was much better to be defended, by reason of the rising Ground;
but he could neither bring that Work, nor any other Design to any perfection, because
of the treachery of his Soldiers, who being most of them <i>Roman-Catholicks</i>,
were so inclin’d to the <i>Portuguese</i> Interest, that they daily more and more deserted
the Companies Service, and gave Intelligence to the Enemy of their Transactions.
Amongst others, an <i>Antwerper</i> was apprehended for an Intelligencer, and being
Hang’d on a Gibbet, fell three times one after another on his Feet, the Halter breaking
like a burnt Thred, which gave him so many times of respit and opportunity
of supplicating for Life; but his Crime was too hainous to admit of Pardon.
Mean while the fled <i>Portugueses</i> being supply’d with fresh Supplies from all Places,
especially from St. <i>Salvador</i>, to the number of twelve hundred Men, they kill’d the
Out-watches, consisting of twenty Men: The next Sentinel being warn’d by the
noise, alarm’d the new Fort, which was scarce finish’d, because a mighty Shower of
Rain had wash’d away the Walls. <i>Hinderson</i> being wounded in the Leg, sent Captain
<i>Montagne</i> against the Enemy, of whose Power he was sensible; yet going to
the place where the Watch that was kill’d had kept their Station, he met with two
hundred <i>Portugueses</i>, divided into three Companies, and drawn out for Battel, who
running away were pursu’d by <i>Montagne</i>, till coming up to their Regiment, which
consisted in all of a thousand Men, divided into five Companies, they fell on all
sides upon <i>Montagne</i>, who fighting valiantly, was overpower’d and kill’d, with three
hundred of his Men, and almost as many more taken Prisoners; amongst whom was
the Minister <i>Astette</i>, four hundred onely escaping into the Fort, where <i>Hinderson</i>
stay’d expecting the event of <i>Montagne</i>’s Exploits.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Defeat spoil’d <i>Schuppe</i>’s Design, who by his marching to <i>Rio Francisco</i>
thought to draw the Enemy from <i>Reciffa</i>; but now being forc’d to think of some
other way, he thought it convenient to invade St. <i>Salvador</i> by Sea, as the Enemy
had done <i>Reciffa</i> by Land. Wherefore <i>Hinderson</i> receiv’d order to stay with six hundred
Men (being all that were left of fifteen hundred,) on <i>Rio Grande</i>, whither a
Barque with Provisions being sent, was taken, and the Men in cool Blood kill’d by
the <i>Portuguese</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Schuppe</i>’s Victory on the Island <i>Taperica</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lichthart</i>’s Death.</div>

<p class='c010'>At the same time it was given out, that <i>Schuppe</i> was going with the Admiral
<i>Bankert</i> to <i>Hinderson</i>’s assistance; and to delude the <i>Portuguese</i> the more, <i>Schuppe</i>
went with two thousand five hundred Men to <i>Rio Francisco</i>, where he lay some
days at an Anchor; upon which the Governor of St. <i>Salvador</i> sending several Companies
thither, <i>Schuppe</i> Sail’d with all speed to St. <i>Salvador</i>, and Landing on the Island
<i>Taperica</i>, four Leagues in circumference, he got a rich Booty, and spar’d none
whome’re he met with, insomuch that two thousand were destroy’d, some by the
Sword upon the place, others by their haste to get over to St. <i>Salvador</i>; for most of
the Vessels being too full, sunk with them. Amongst the Prisoners that were taken
and sent to <i>Reciffa</i>, were two Monks, who were design’d the same Entertainment
as the Minister <i>Astette</i> should receive in St. <i>Salvador</i>; whereupon they immediately
wrote to their Fraternity, to take care that <i>Astette</i> should not be burnt alive, as the
<i>Portuguese</i> had threatned, because they were to expect the same usage: whereupon
<i>Astette</i> was set at liberty, and had leave to walk up and down the Streets of St. <i>Salvador</i>.
<i>Schuppe</i> fortifi’d himself on <i>Taperica</i>, near an Inlet under the new Works,
and together with <i>Lichthart</i> watch’d for all <i>Portuguese</i> Vessels: But <i>Lichthart</i> dying
here, was carry’d to <i>Reciffa</i>, and there bury’d. On the other side, the Governor of
St. <i>Salvador</i> sent fifteen hundred Men in the Night to the other side of <i>Taperica</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_587'>587</span>where with all speed they Intrench’d themselves, and Sally’d daily out of their
Works upon <i>Schuppe</i>, so that many Men were lost on both sides; but <i>Schuppe</i> was in
the worst Condition, in regard his Soldiers ran over in great numbers to St. <i>Salvador</i>,
where they were well Entertain’d; of which he advertis’d the Privy-Council,
who were the less able to give him Redress, as having the same cause of Complaint.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A pitiful Example of a young Soldiers Execution.</div>

<p class='c010'>Amongst others there hapned a sad Accident of a young Soldier, scarce sixteen
years old, and born at <i>Roan</i>, who having robb’d his Father’s Cash, went in a Ship
to <i>Holland</i>; where he lavishly spending the Money, was forc’d at last to List himself
in the <i>West-India</i> Companies Service, and coming with the fore-mention’d Fleet
to <i>Reciffa</i>, endeavor’d with two Companies to run to the <i>Portuguese</i>; but overtaken,
was Try’d for the Fact, and Condemn’d to be Hang’d, for none of his Excuses
which he made, of going over the River onely to fetch some Oranges and Lemmons
to refresh himself, would save him, nor his protesting that he had no intention
of going to the Enemy, nor the Promise that his Father should release him for
ten thousand Crowns, nor his Minority, which ought chiefly to have been consider’d,
but that Necessity stopt the Ears of the Compassionate; so that his Execution
drew pity from the Beholders a few Weeks after.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A notable Passage of a <i>Portuguese</i>, Executed for Treason.</div>

<p class='c010'>A very astonishing Passage hapned at <i>Reciffa</i> upon another Sentence of Death
pronounc’d against a <i>Portuguese</i>, who after the publication of the Act of Pardon
came to <i>Reciffa</i>, and there hir’d a Seaman for two hundred Crowns, to carry a
Letter, made up in a Leaden Box, to the Governor of the Promontory of St. <i>Augustine</i>,
with order that if he was set upon any where, he should throw the Box into
the Water. The Letter written in strange Characters, contain’d a Declaration of
the small number of Men in <i>Reciffa</i>, most of the <i>Netherlanders</i> Forces lying on the
Island <i>Taperica</i>, so that if <i>Reciffa</i> were Storm’d along the Bank, and from <i>Maurice-stadt</i>,
it might easily be taken. This Letter being intercepted, the <i>Portuguese</i> was
taken and Condemn’d, and as he was carrying to the Place of Execution cry’d aloud,
<i>You People take delight in my Death, but you shall be interrupted</i>; and indeed it hapned accordingly:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_588'>588</span>for when the Executioner began to scorch the half-strangled Criminal
with Straw, there sprung up a strange Spirit of Contention amongst the Spectators,
who began to justle and strike one another; and soon after a Whirlwind rose
in the midst of the Market-place, which in a moment caus’d them all to stagger
like drunken People, their Hats and Caps were blown up into the Air, the whole
multitude tumbling confusedly on the Ground, the Arm’d Soldiers flying to the
next Houses, and the Executioner falling down in a Trance from the Scaffold: A
full quarter of an hour this Confusion had lasted, when the People came to themselves
again, and the Hangman return’d to his Business, cutting off the <i>Portuguese</i>’s
Nose, Ears, Privy-Members, and tearing out his Heart, which he threw to two
Dogs, who devour’d the same; then dividing the Body into Quarters, which were
set up at the four Corners of the City for an Example.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same Punishment receiv’d a <i>Mulatto</i>, who endeavor’d to fire two of the <i>Hollanders</i>
best Ships in the Haven.</p>

<p class='c010'>Notwithstanding these Punishments, the Soldiers ran away daily; the blame
whereof might justly be laid on the Magistrates, who took no notice of the Soldiers
just Complaints of their Officers, cheating them of a third part of their Provision,
and inflicting severe Punishments upon them as Mutineers, when they had
real cause of Complaint.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Schuppe</i> was at the same time shrewdly put to it for want of Men, who either
dy’d of the then reigning Disease, or ran away to the Enemy; so that he was forced
to leave the Island <i>Taperica</i>, and inclose himself within his new rais’d Sconce.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Admiral <i>Bankert</i> gains a great Victory over the <i>Portuguese</i> Fleet.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Admiral <i>Bankert</i> had better success; for Cruising up and down before the
Inlet <i>Todos los Sanctos</i>, after the taking and sinking of several Ships as they came in
his way, he at last set upon the <i>Portuguese</i> Fleet, consisting of seven great Ships, of
which one got to St. <i>Salvador</i>, another was sunk, and the other five were taken, being
valu’d at twenty Tuns of Gold, or 200000 l. <i>Sterl.</i> In this Engagement were
kill’d above four hundred <i>Portugueses</i>, besides two hundred and fifty who were taken
Prisoners, and sent Shackled to <i>Reciffa</i>. Amongst them was the new Vice-Roy
of <i>Brasile</i>, the Admiral, Vice-Admiral, three Monks, and several other Persons
of note.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Marshal <i>Hous</i> arrives at <i>Reciffa</i> with a fresh Supply.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Victory began to give some Breath to <i>Reciffa</i>, when at the same time Marshal
<i>Hous</i> arriv’d there with seven Ships, Mann’d with five hundred Soldiers. This
<i>Hous</i> on the seventeenth of <i>August</i>, Anno 1645. had been taken Prisoner at the <i>Engenho</i>
having fought so long till all his Powder was spent, so that he was forc’d to
surrender himself upon promise of Quarter to <i>Vidal</i>, who after he had taken an Oath
upon the <i>Bible</i>, to spare the Lives of all the <i>Hollanders</i> and <i>Brasilians</i> fell upon the
<i>Brasilians</i> and slew them, being a hundred in all, in Cold-blood, who yet sold their
Lives at no easie rate. Being carry’d Prisoner, together with Captain <i>Bristow</i>, <i>Listry</i>,
<i>Wildschut</i>, <i>Blar</i>, and two hundred more, by <i>Viera</i> to <i>Casa de Prugar</i>, he was thence
sent to <i>Portugal</i>, where being releas’d, he brought News to the <i>States</i> of the mean
Condition of the <i>West-India</i> Company, and that all things must needs be lost, if they
did not speedily take the Business into Consideration: Whereupon he was furnish’d
with a Supply of Ships and Men, with which he set Sail for <i>Brasile</i>; where
being arriv’d, most part of the Soldiers he brought with him were Transported to
<i>Taperica</i>, to assist <i>Schuppe</i>; who as soon as they came to him, march’d into the Countrey;
where being set upon by a thousand <i>Portugueses</i>, he lost sixty Men.</p>

<p class='c010'>Soon after <i>Hoogenstraet</i> receiving Orders from the Governor of St. <i>Salvador</i>, who
was inform’d by some Prisoners, that <i>Schuppe</i> had not above twelve hundred fighting
Men, to fall upon him with three thousand, made a furious Assault upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_589'>589</span>Sconce in two places, and Storming the same for two hours together, lost four
hundred Men, which made him draw off a little before Day-break.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the interim nine Privateers, fitted out by several Merchants of <i>Holland</i> and
<i>Zealand</i>, came to Cruise up and down before the Coast of <i>Brasile</i>; which the <i>States</i>
the rather allow’d of, because the <i>West-India</i> Company was not able to send any
more Supplies thither: Nor was it long ere they took five <i>Portuguese</i> Prizes, and
afterwards (joyning with <i>Bankert</i>) four more laden full of Sugar, in the Haven <i>Todos
los Sanctos</i>, where they threw a hundred and twenty <i>Portuguese</i>, and fifty revolted
<i>Hollanders</i> overboard.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Council of <i>Reciffa</i> send over Messengers to represent the sad condition of the Place.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Bankert</i>’s Death and Character.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Reciffa</i> being at that time reduc’d to very great straits, earnestly implor’d Aid
from the <i>States</i>, but to little purpose, by reason of the Differences amongst themselves,
which hapned upon this occasion: The <i>Spanish</i> King by his Agent in the
<i>Hague</i> made Overtures of Peace, and proffer’d to fall upon the <i>Portuguese</i> in <i>Brasile</i>:
to which Proposition, whenas the rest of the <i>States</i> seem’d inclinable, those of <i>Zealand</i>
would no ways hearken, being resolv’d to have nothing to do with <i>Spain</i>. The
news of this Dissention exceedingly perplex’d the Council at <i>Reciffa</i>, especially
when to that news was added, that <i>Bankert</i>, the onely terror to the Enemy at Sea,
was Commanded home by the <i>States</i> of <i>Zealand</i>, which yet the <i>General States</i> strictly
forbad. Whereupon they thought fit to send one of their Assembly to the <i>Hague</i>,
to make the <i>States</i> acquainted with the miserable Condition of <i>Brasile</i>, and to Expostulate
with them for their insensibility of their Condition, and to let them understand,
that ten thousand Men would not restore <i>Brasile</i> to its former Condition:
Every one strove to be the Messenger of these sad tydings, but especially their President
<i>Schonenbergh</i> wish’d it might be his lot to leave the unhappy Countrey of
<i>Brasile</i>; but because his departure would not have been without great murmuring
of the People, <i>Haeks</i> was sent in his stead. Together with him went <i>Hinderson</i> (who
was in no esteem since the Destruction on <i>Rio Grande</i>;) they both Embarqu’d on
<i>Bankert</i>’s Ship and five others, which in stead of being laden with rich Commodities,
and ballasted with Sugar, as heretofore, were fraught with discontented Seamen,
decrepid and sick Soldiers, unserviceable <i>Jews</i>, poor Travellers, <i>Portuguese</i>
Prisoners, and onely ten Weeks Provisions; whereas all other Vessels at their Return
from <i>Brasile</i> us’d to have Provision for three Moneths, which at this time
could not be spar’d. The Council also made Orders what Persons should go with
the fore-mention’d Ships, <i>viz.</i> None but those whose Names were written in the
Lists which had stuck six Weeks at every Church Door, that by that means no Creditor
might suffer by his Debtors going away, nor any Criminal escape his deserved
punishment. <i>Bankert</i> had scarce been a Week at Sea, when he dy’d of the Palsie:
he was a Man, who for his valiant Exploits was from a Fore-mast Man preferred
to be Captain; which Office he perform’d with great Prudence and Valor; but
that which first made him most eminently taken notice of, was his Engaging with
thirteen <i>Dunkirkers</i>, of which he sunk three, and being boarded by three more, and
fir’d at by the rest, he refus’d to surrender his Ship on promise of Quarter, but
plac’d his eldest Son with a lighted Match in the Powder-room, commanding him
on pain of Death to blow up the Ship with the three <i>Dunkirkers</i> as soon as he gave
the Word; which valorous Resolution so amaz’d the Enemy, that they let him go.
He also behav’d himself bravely in the <i>Downs</i> against the <i>Spanish</i> Admiral <i>Oquendo</i>.
His two Sons that were present when he gave up the Ghost, would not have his
Body thrown overboard, notwithstanding it stunk so intolerably, that all the Provisions
in the Ship were tainted by it; therefore taking out his Entrails, they
Salted the Body, wrapt it up in four Sail-cloths, and nailing the same up in a pitchy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_590'>590</span>Chest, bury’d it under the Ballast. Mean while the Fleet approaching the
<i>Flemmish</i> Isles, was surpris’d by a terrible Storm, in which the Vice-Admiral’s old
Ship split asunder, but most of the People were sav’d. Between <i>Calice</i> and <i>Dover</i>
they met with eight <i>Ostenders</i>, against whom they made themselves ready to Fight;
but they, according to the King of <i>Spain</i>’s Order, instead of Hostility shew’d them
Friendship. All their Provisions were spent, when they happily Anchor’d before
<i>Flushing</i>, where <i>Bankert</i>’s Body was Interr’d with great Solemnity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Overtures of Peace from the <i>Portuguese</i> refus’d by the <i>Netherlands</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the interim the <i>United Netherlands</i> had fitted out another Fleet to assist <i>Reciffa</i>,
the <i>West-India</i> Company having first demanded of the King of <i>Portugal</i> two hundred
and eighty Tuns of Gold, to the value of which they affirm’d themselves to have
been damag’d by the Insurrection of the <i>Portuguese</i>. On the other side, the King of
<i>Portugal</i> was in a quandary about the Business of <i>Brasile</i>; for first, he had no other
thoughts but that <i>Brasile</i> would have fall’n into his hands within the space of three
Moneths, because the Plot there was so subtilly laid; neither did he think the <i>States</i>
would have concern’d themselves with the <i>West-India</i> Companies Business, which
now it was manifest they did. Besides this, there was a third Inconvenience, <i>viz.</i> that
the <i>Spanish</i> Crown endeavor’d to conclude a Peace with the <i>United Netherlands</i>;
wherefore that he might put a stop to the sending of the Fleet to <i>Brasile</i>, he dealt with
the <i>French</i> Ambassador to make very advantageous Proffers in his behalf, <i>viz.</i> That
he would surrender all the conquer’d Places, and make good all the Damages that
had been sustain’d thereby. The Fleet appointed to go to <i>Brasile</i> was hereupon stopt,
till the <i>States</i> had Consulted about an Answer on the fore-mention’d Propositions;
but when <i>Haeks</i> brought news of the falshood of the <i>Portuguese</i>, the Scale was immediately
turn’d, insomuch that the <i>Portuguese</i> Ambassador went in danger of his
Life, till the Mutineers were put into Custody. Moreover the Fleet was order’d
to Sail with all speed possible to <i>Reciffa</i>, with promise that another Fleet should
soon follow with six thousand Men; but the many disconsolate tydings that had
been brought of late, of the hardships and sufferings of those that went before,
through the unwholsomness of the Climate, the want of Provisions, the Strength
and Cruelty of the Enemy, made the Seamen and Soldiers very unwilling to go so
fatal a Voyage, insomuch that as many as could, made their escape: yet at last, on
the last day of <i>December</i>, Anno 1647. the Fleet set Sail under the Command of
<i>Corneliszoon de Wit</i>; some Weeks before which <i>Schuppe</i> was forc’d to desert the Island
<i>Taperica</i>, to go and aid <i>Reciffa</i>, which the <i>Portuguese</i> from a rais’d Battery on the
other side of the River <i>Biberibi</i> shot at so incessantly, that none were safe either in
their Houses or in the Streets.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mean while the <i>Portuguese</i> Agent, <i>Francisco de Sousa Continho</i>, proffer’d the <i>States</i>
to go to <i>Brasile</i> himself, and cause to be restor’d all those Places which had been taken
from the <i>West-India</i> Company, particularly the City St. <i>Salvador</i> and <i>Tercera</i>, besides
Reparation for all other Damages.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Grave Maurice</i> his high Demands.</div>

<p class='c010'>At the same time <i>Grave Maurice</i> was Treated with to go to <i>Brasile</i> again, but his
Demands were so high, that it came to nothing; for he requir’d 4000 <i>l.</i> yearly to
spend at his Table, and 5000 <i>l.</i> besides during his Life; also 2000 <i>l.</i> to set him out,
and twelve thousand Men to Besiege St. <i>Salvador</i>, which was always guarded by
four thousand, and thirty Carvels lay ready before <i>Lisbon</i> to carry four thousand
more thither.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Angola</i> and <i>Loando</i> taken by the <i>Portuguese</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>All things went very ill on the <i>Hollanders</i> side at this present; for besides that the
fore-mention’d Fleet had not its wish’d success, most of the Men being destroy’d
by the immoderate Heat of the Climate, <i>Angola</i> and <i>Loando</i> were also taken by the
<i>Portuguese</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_591'>591</span>These Misfortunes made the <i>West-India</i> Company begin to be very forward
to come to a Treaty with the <i>Portuguese</i> Agent, who before seem’d rather to court
them, having offer’d to Engage for the restoration of whatever they possess’d at
that time, when the ten years Peace was concluded; but when they came to insist
upon that Point, he answer’d, That he must expect new Orders from <i>Lisbon</i> concerning
<i>Loando</i>, because the taking of that Place caus’d an alteration in the state
of Affairs. But the <i>States</i> no way satisfi’d with Delays, that were like to prove both
hurtful and disgraceful, resolv’d to put into Execution what they had before agreed
upon, <i>viz.</i> The <i>East-India</i> Company was impower’d to make Prize of all <i>Portuguese</i>
Ships towards the payment of the fifteen Tuns of Gold ordain’d for the <i>West-India</i>
Company, to help them against the <i>Portuguese</i> Oppression. The <i>West-India</i> Company
also receiv’d Commissions to Cruise for <i>Portuguese</i> Vessels before <i>Brasile</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Schuppe</i> and <i>Coche</i> miserably defeated as they were Besieging <i>Gararapes</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>On the seventeenth of <i>February</i>, Anno 1649. three thousand Soldiers that came
over in the fore-mention’d Fleet, besides two hundred <i>Negro</i>’s, and as many Seamen,
marching to Besiege <i>Gararapes</i> under the Command of <i>Schuppe</i> and <i>Coche</i>, were
so furiously set upon by the Sallying Enemy, that they were forc’d to break up the
Siege in great disorder, whilest the <i>Portuguese</i> being in number two thousand five
hundred, fell upon the Rere; and though the <i>Dutch</i> Officers us’d all the care they
could possible to bring their Men to face about, yet they were not able to keep
them from running away; in which flight great slaughter of them was made by
the <i>Portuguese</i> Horse, consisting of a hundred and thirty, Arm’d with Lances, insomuch
that in the flight and the pursuit, a thousand <i>Netherlanders</i> were slain, and
nineteen Ensigns or Colours were left behind as Trophies for the <i>Portuguese</i>; the
chief of the Slain were Colonel <i>Brink</i> and <i>Houteryve</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Zealanders</i> were much concern’d at the improsperous Affairs of <i>Brasile</i>, in regard
a fifth part of the <i>West-India</i> Companies Stock belong’d to <i>Middleburg</i>, <i>Flushing</i>,
and <i>Veer</i>, insomuch that the Complaints of Widows and Orphans that shar’d in the
common loss, mov’d the <i>States</i> to fit out six great Ships, and as many Ketches,
Mann’d with two thousand eight hundred Men, for <i>Brasile</i>, where all things ran
to ruine, the Grandees both of the Council, Army, and Fleet, being at variance, and
impeaching one another.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rest of the Provinces, especially <i>Friesland</i>, being less inclin’d to the <i>West-India</i>
Company, were somewhat colder in the pursuit of this Business; nevertheless, upon
a fresh Letter of Complaint from <i>Walter Schonenbergh</i>, President of the <i>Brasilian</i>
Council, they held a Consultation together, how to raise Moneys for the fitting
out of twenty Ships and five Ketches for the Relief of <i>Brasile</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>De Wit</i> releas’d from Prison, justifies his Return.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Admiral <i>De Wit</i> returning home, was, upon the accusation of the Council
in <i>Brasile</i>, and the General, <i>Sigismond Schuppe</i>, made Prisoner in the <i>Hague</i>; and together
with him the other five Captains that went with him were Committed by
the Admiralty, for returning without the Consent of the Council; but they were
soon releas’d by the Magistrates of <i>Amsterdam</i>, who upon the Admiralties refusing
to deliver them, commanded their Provost-Marshal to break open their Prison
Doors. <i>De Wit</i> after his Releasement justifi’d what he had done before a full Assembly
of the <i>States</i>, and alledg’d that it was according to the Orders he receiv’d
when he undertook this Expedition.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Portuguese</i> Agent, <i>Sousa Macede</i>, obtaining Audience of the <i>States</i>, told them
how ready the King his Master had been to come to a perfect Agreement of Peace
with them, but that their own Acts of Hostility had been the occasion of the breach
of that Treaty of Peace that had been concluded on; that the Robberies and Insolencies
committed by those <i>Portugueses</i> under their Jurisdiction, was not any way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_592'>592</span>authoris’d or countenanc’d by him; lastly, he offer’d them free Trade to <i>Brasile</i>
eighty Tun of Gold to the <i>West-India Company</i>, 800000 <i>l.</i> to the Orphans and Widows
in <i>Zealand</i>, and payment of all private Debts. But making no mention of
restoring the Places in <i>Brasile</i>, he seem’d to mock the <i>States</i>; who resented it so
much, that they would admit of no farther Conference with him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Schuppe</i>, <i>Haeks</i>, and <i>Schonenbergh</i> declare the Reasons of the loss of <i>Reciffa</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Mean while the <i>West-India</i> Companies Business in <i>Brasile</i> went daily more and
more to ruine, insomuch that in the Year 1654. they lost all their Forts and Places
of Strength and Habitation, and amongst them <i>Reciffa</i>, the chief Residence of the
Council of <i>Brasile</i>, who returning home, brought nothing but a doleful Relation
of their unfortunate Proceedings. <i>Schuppe</i>, <i>Haeks</i>, and <i>Schonenbergh</i>, made each of
them a long Oration, setting forth the sad Condition of the Place, and the Miseries
they had endur’d a long time before they left it; also excusing their total quitting
thereof to the Enemy by the great want of Provisions and other Supplies, which
they so often had written for in vain, at least receiv’d short of what their Necessities
requir’d, and by the Clamours of the Soldiers, who were ready upon all occasions
to Mutiny or Revolt, as appear’d by their crying out upon the discovery of a Fleet
of <i>Portuguese</i> upon the Coast, <i>Behold our Deliverers from</i> the Netherlanders <i>Tyranny</i>;
lastly, by the growing Power of their Enemies, which they could not have resisted,
though they themselves had been much stronger than they were.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>They are try’d at a Council of War.</div>

<p class='c010'>But the <i>West-India</i> Company sensibly touch’d at the thoughts of their Losses, were
not satisfi’d with the Relation of <i>Schonenbergh</i>, <i>Haeks</i>, and <i>Schuppe</i>, but requir’d a
Journal of every days Transactions, or Testimonies to confirm the truth of their
Relation: They also demanded an Account of the Condition of the Store-houses
when <i>Reciffa</i> was surrendred, and fell upon them with several Interrogatories, <i>viz.</i>
Why the Fort <i>Afogados</i> was forsaken? Why the Garrisons were not drawn in from
the North to <i>Reciffa</i>? Why they did not keep footing on the Land, and guard
those Places they had left when <i>Reciffa</i> was lost? Why they made such ado for
want of Provisions and Ammunition to dishearten the People? Why the Money
proffer’d by several Citizens was not taken? Why they did not burn the Enemy’s
Fleet, since, according to the opinion of several, it might easily have been done?
How they could testifie the Sedition of the Soldiers, since none of their Commanders
complain’d of it? Whether they us’d any Means to encourage the Besieged?
Who did, and who did not consent to the Surrender? Whether no better Terms could
have been made? In fine, they prevail’d with the <i>States</i> to secure <i>Schonenbergh</i>, <i>Haeks</i>,
and <i>Schuppe</i>, in their Houses, and on the ninth of <i>September</i>, Anno 1654. brought
them before a Council of War in the <i>Hague</i>, where the chief things objected against
them were, That the <i>Portuguese</i> had gotten by the Conquest of <i>Reciffa</i>, above two
hundred Brass Guns, most of them Demi-Culverins, and four hundred Iron Guns,
valu’d together at ten hundred thousand <i>Rixdollars</i>; That the Store-houses were
sufficiently stock’d with Provision and Ammunition; That they took care to secure
their own Goods, but left what belong’d to the <i>West-India</i> Company as a Prey
to the Enemy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Pleas.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Schuppe</i> condemn’d at a Council of War to lose his Salary.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Schuppe</i> on his part alledg’d, that he could do nothing of himself, as being under
the Command of the <i>Brasilian</i> Council. <i>Haeks</i> and <i>Schonenbergh</i> pleaded the want
of Men, by reason of the many that daily dropt from them, either by Death or
Defection, to the Enemy, and those that remain’d, unsafe to be trusted, as consisting
of so many different Nations, also their being block’d up at the Sea by the
<i>Portuguese</i> Fleet, the great want of Ammunition, especially Instruments of Fortification;
lastly, the head-strong Resolutions of the Soldiers, to deliver up the Place,
whatever their Officers should determine to the contrary; notwithstanding which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_593'>593</span>to shew that it was not quitted upon disadvantageous terms, they produc’d the
Articles of Agreement upon which it was surrendred to <i>Francisco</i>, Governor of
<i>Pernambuco</i>. In conclusion, the Council of War pass’d their Sentence on <i>Schuppe</i>,
<i>viz.</i> That he should lose all the Sallary that was due to him from the <i>West-India</i>
Company since the twenty sixth of <i>January</i> 1654. when he Sign’d the Agreement
with <i>Baretto</i> for the delivering up of <i>Reciffa</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus the <i>Portuguese</i> recover’d full and absolute possession of <i>Brasile</i>, yet not without
fear of an afterclap of War; wherefore the <i>Portuguese</i> Agent, upon condition of
an absolute Peace to be concluded, proffer’d the <i>States General</i> in the <i>Hague</i>, Satisfaction
for the Damages which the <i>West-India</i> Company had sustain’d in <i>Brasile</i>,
eighty Tun of Gold, a free Trade to <i>Brasile</i>, and payment of the Debts due to them
from several <i>Portugueses</i> in <i>Brasile</i>; but told them, that to surrender them any Places
there, was not in the power of the <i>Portuguese</i> Crown. On the other side, the <i>Spaniard</i>
proffer’d to assist them in the total Conquest of <i>Brasile</i>, and to restore them
those Places they formerly possess’d, as soon as they had subdu’d the <i>Portuguese</i>; to
which the <i>Zealanders</i> began to hearken, who being great Losers by the <i>Portugueses</i>
Treachery, wish’d for nothing more than Revenge; but <i>Holland</i> having a great
Trade to <i>Portugal</i>, was more inclin’d to Peace: Whereupon His Majesty of great
<i>Britain</i> proffer’d himself to be Mediator between the <i>Portuguese</i> Crown and the
<i>United Netherlands</i>; and accordingly on the sixth of <i>August</i>, Anno 1661. a Peace was
concluded with <i>Portugal</i> on these Terms:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Articles of Peace between <i>Portugal</i> and the <i>United Netherlands</i>.</div>

<p class='c017'>I. <i>That</i> Portugal <i>was to pay to the</i> United Netherlands <i>eighty Tun of Gold, either in
ready Money, Sugar, Tobacco, or Salt, or deduct the same out of the Customs payable in the</i>
Portuguese <i>Harbors</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'>II. <i>That the Guns on</i> Reciffa <i>were to be restor’d to the</i> West-India <i>Company</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'>III. <i>That the Salt-Trade at</i> St. Uves <i>and other Places under the</i> Portuguese <i>Jurisdiction,
whether in</i> Africa <i>or</i> Brasile, <i>should be granted to the</i> Netherlands, <i>paying the Customs as the</i>
Portuguese <i>do themselves</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'>IV. <i>That the conquer’d Places gotten on both sides, should remain in the hands of the present
Possessors.</i></p>

<p class='c018'>V. <i>That the King of</i> Portugal <i>should not lay an Embargo on any</i> Netherland <i>Vessel, on
any pretence whatsoever, though they should carry all manner of Ammunition to his Enemies, provided
it were not out of any of the</i> Portuguese <i>Havens</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'>VI. <i>That no</i> Netherlander <i>should ever be call’d before any Judge about any Difference in
Religion, but should have freedom thereof granted him, either in his House or Ship, and also
a convenient Burying-place</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'>VII. <i>That if any Difference should chance to arise between</i> Portugal <i>and the</i> Netherlands,
<i>they should not extend it to prejudice the Trade, but every Merchant should be free to call in his
Debts, and send Ships without hinderance</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'>VIII. <i>That this present Agreement should not be broken by any Misdemeanors acted by any
Subjects, either in the</i> East <i>or</i> West-Indies, <i>who were to be punish’d by their lawful Judges</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'>IX. <i>That the Havens belonging to both Parties were to be free for either Men of War or
Merchant-Men.</i></p>

<p class='c018'>X. <i>That the</i> Netherlanders <i>Trading in</i> Portugal, <i>might go Arm’d, take Houses and
Store-houses</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'>XI. <i>That the Goods laden in an Enemy’s Ship might be declar’d free Prize.</i></p>

<p class='c018'>XII. <i>That the</i> Portuguese <i>in</i> Brasile <i>should pay their Debts which they ow’d to the</i> West-India
<i>Company, or any other Person or Persons; to which purpose three appointed Commissioners
were to Sit at</i> Lisbon, <i>to hear and determine the Causes that should be brought before them, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_594'>594</span>without the usual Circumstances, pass their Sentence, which was to be Executed by a higher
Power</i>.</p>

<p class='c019'>A few days after this Agreement was concluded, the <i>Portuguese</i> Ambassador,
<i>Henrico Sousa Tovares</i>, went for <i>Lisbon</i>, where he arriv’d on the last day of <i>September</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>States</i> of <i>Groningen</i> and others, disapprove the Peace with <i>Portugal</i>, and condemn <i>Schulenbergh</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Not onely <i>Guelderland</i> and <i>Zealand</i>, were much dissatisfi’d with this Agreement,
but also <i>Groningen</i> accus’d their Deputy <i>Schulenbergh</i>, that contrary to Orders he had
been too forward in concluding the Peace with <i>Portugal</i>, and that he had consented
to that which the <i>States</i> of <i>Groningen</i> had not permitted him; for they resolv’d
to make Peace on no other account, but that <i>Portugal</i> should pay the eighty
Tun of Gold in ready Money, and that in a short time; whenas on the contrary,
he had allow’d of the payment in Merchandise, and that in a long time. Wherefore
the <i>States</i> of <i>Groningen</i> (who for this Fact and several Accusations brought
against <i>Schulenbergh</i>, condemn’d him to be Beheaded, which Sentence had been Executed
upon him, had he not made his Escape) together with those of <i>Omeland</i>, and
others, who disapprov’d of the Peace concluded with <i>Portugal</i>, drew up many Reasons
why they dissented, and look’d upon it as both dishonorable and disadvantageous;
however, the Articles being Sign’d, and the <i>States General</i>, taking into consideration
how impossible a Work it would have been to have gone about to renew
a War with the <i>Portuguese</i> in <i>Brasile</i>, being at that time in firm possession of
all, and that for the Interest of a few, in respect of the whole Common-wealth,
they were forc’d to rest satisfi’d, and together with the <i>West-India</i> Company, to sit
down with the loss of those Places in <i>Brasile</i>, which had cost so much Blood and
Treasure to gain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>West-India</i> Companies Memorial deliver’d in to the <i>States</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Nevertheless the <i>West-India</i> Company put in a Memorial at the <i>Hague</i>, of all that
had been done them from time to time, wherein they themselves had been great
Sufferers, and the Common-wealth very much advantag’d, as namely, That at first
they put in a Stock of seventy four Tun of Gold, sent out divers Fleets under the
Admirals <i>Willekens</i>, <i>John Dirkszoon Lam</i>, <i>Boudewyn</i>, <i>Henrickszoon</i>, <i>Peter Hein</i>, <i>Adrian
Pater</i>, <i>Henrick Lonk</i>, <i>Dirk Uitgeest</i>, <i>Peter Ita</i>, <i>Loos</i>, <i>Cornelis Houte-been</i>, <i>Lichthart</i>, <i>Bankert</i>,
and others, at several times, which had much weakned the <i>Spanish</i> Power, to the
great advantage of the <i>United Netherlands</i>, because the <i>Spaniard</i> was not onely forc’d
to disperce his Power to defend <i>America</i>, but also lost great Riches on the Coast
thereof, which being the Sinews of his War, prevented him from oppressing that
<i>State</i>; That to their loss they suffer’d their Forces to stop the Enemy, when he broke
into the <i>Veluwe</i>, at that time when the <i>United Netherlands</i> seem’d to hang by a silken
Thred; That it would probably have been the ruine of <i>Holland</i>, if the mighty <i>Spanish</i>
Fleet which Engag’d with <i>Martin Tromp</i> in the <i>Downs</i>, had been assisted by sixty
six Sail, which <i>La Torre</i> was forc’d to send to the Coast of <i>Brasile</i>, against the <i>West-India</i>
Company; That this Companies Concern was so great a Nursery of Mariners
in the Year 1629. that they had above a hundred Ships at Sea, and fifteen thousand
Men in their Service; which the <i>United Netherlands</i> considering, and judging
that Charge too great for the Company to maintain, had resolv’d to contribute a
certain Sum towards it yearly, which had not yet been paid; which made them
take up Money upon Interest, and put in a Supply of thirty Tun of Gold for the
payment of the same; That the Expedition of <i>Henrick  Brewer</i> to <i>Chili</i> had put them
very much behind-hand, because the Enemy having notice of it, secur’d himself,
yet was often terrifi’d with it; for <i>Brewer</i> having found out a Way to go from <i>Reciffa</i>
to the Province of <i>Chili</i> in two Moneths, and accordingly to do great mischief
to the <i>Spanish</i> Power, whose Riches lay bare all along the South Sea; this and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_595'>595</span>many other things forc’d to make that honorable Peace with the <i>Netherlands</i>, concluded
on in <i>Munster</i>, Anno 1648.; That their Losses, computed and deliver’d in
to the <i>States General</i>, amounted to sixty six Tun of Gold, and forty three thousand
two hundred and ninety <i>Guilders</i>, which forc’d them to take up Money to
pay Interest for what they had before, yet that they still kept fifty great Ships at
Sea, and were resolv’d to prosecute their Trade with fresh vigor, as soon as Satisfaction
should be given from the <i>Portuguese</i> Crown, as was promis’d them in the
Articles of Agreement, and they could obtain of their Lordships, to have their
Patent prolong’d for a considerable time; That they were still indebted to those
Orphans and Widows who furnish’d them with Money to set out their Forces,
which in the first twelve years did the <i>Spaniard</i> so much hurt, that the Damage is
reckon’d to amount to one thousand one hundred and eighty Tun of Gold.</p>

<p class='c010'>These things being taken into consideration by the <i>States General</i>, they granted
the Company their Request, and gave them a new Patent, by virtue of which they
now Trade to <i>Africa</i> and the <i>Caribbee-Islands</i>, since they were forc’d to quit all they
had possess’d in <i>Brasile</i>.</p>

<h4 id='c595' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. XII.</span><br /> <i>The Journey of</i> Rodulphus Baron, <i>with the Description of the Customs and Manners of the</i> Tapuyans.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'><i>Rodulphus Baron</i>, to make a Discovery of the Countrey, upon the Encouragement
of <i>Grave Maurice</i>, who allow’d him to that purpose a yearly Revenue,
undertook a remarkable Journey, accompany’d with three <i>Tapuyans</i>;
who going out of the Village <i>Caneri</i> without any store of Provisions, left the Mountains
<i>Cupaeva</i> on the right-hand, and went seventy Leagues into the Countrey,
without meeting with any People, onely he found one Mountain of <i>Fossile</i> Glass;
from whence he went Southward to the Villages of the <i>Waripebares</i> and <i>Caripati</i>, who
having courteously Entertain’d him, appointed certain Persons to accompany him
from one Village to another, with Orders to Complement <i>Grave Maurice</i>, who sent
them home with several Gifts.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Waripebares</i> and <i>Caripati</i> inhabit fourteen Villages on the Mountains which
Bound <i>Brasile</i> Westward, live by Hunting and Fishing, eat wild Honey and all
manner of Fruit, and maintain continual Wars against a mighty People which inhabit
the Western Plains.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Customs and Manners of the <i>Tapuyans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>As for the <i>Tapuyans</i>, they range up and down between the Rivers <i>Grande</i>, <i>Quoauguho</i>,
<i>Ocioro</i>, <i>Upameoma</i>, and <i>Voiroguo</i>, without having any setled Abodes; they are a
strong People, stern of Countenance, and black Hair’d: In stead of Circumcising
their Children, they cut them, which is done after this manner: The Priests stand
on a row, Dancing and Singing, whilest one of them swings the Child round about
his Head before all the Multitude, and then runs away with it; at last returning,
sets it in his Lap, whilest another Priest cutting a Hole in the Ears and Lips
thereof, puts little Bones into the same, and the Mother cries and howls after a
terrible manner. At these Ceremonies, which end with Dancing and Singing,
their King is always present.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Virgins are kept by their Parents till the Mothers perceive them to have
their Monethly Courses, which they immediately reveal to the Priests, who acquaint
the King therewith, before whom the Maid, being Painted red, is brought;
whom having smoak’d with Tobacco, he throws an Arrow at a Garland, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_596'>596</span>she wears on her Head, and if he chances to hit it, he gives her his Benediction, by
licking certain parts of her Body, from which she hopes to receive long Life.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_692.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>So soon as a Woman is gotten with Child by her Husband, she lies no more
with him, but he is permitted to enjoy his other Wives, whose number is either
more or less, according to every ones pleasure. The Women after Delivery eat
their After-birth.</p>

<p class='c010'>Adultery is free for Men, but if Women be taken in the Act, they are immediately
put to Death.</p>

<p class='c010'>After they have done Soweing and Planting, the King calls all his People and
Subjects together, and appears to them hung round with Garlands; and all of
them have their Bodies Painted and stuck full of divers colour’d Feathers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange kind of Prognostication.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Priests when they go about to foretel future Events, either Sing or Pipe, and
at the same time hold up their Heads towards the Skie, and stand gazing, as if they
saw some strange Vision in the Air; on some of their Backs hangs a Bundle of
Ostriches Feathers; some throw Feathers in the Air, to see which way the Wind
blows. When the Waters overflowing <i>Brasile</i> did much harm, <i>Anno 1641.</i> the
Priests being Consulted, brought forth the King’s <i>Calabash</i>, in which lay their sacred
Stones call’d <i>Cohuterak</i> and <i>Titscheyouh</i>, and began to Dance and Sing; next six
Priests were plac’d in a row, which were to Prognosticate: whereupon the first
taking up a Stone, said, <i>The</i> Netherlanders <i>have given Battel to those in</i> St. Salvador,
<i>but are now about an Agreement</i>: The second held up a Blossom of <i>Indian</i>
Wheat, and foretold that there would be plenty of that Grain: The third holding
a white Pebble-stone, promis’d store of Milk: The fourth grasp’d a Stone like
Bread, telling them that the Countrey should produce much Bread: The fifth
holding up a Bowe and Arrow hung full of Feathers, cry’d aloud, <i>This is a Gift of
the Angels, Birds shall flie thicker than these Feathers hang together</i>: The sixth, having a
lump of Wax, foretold that there would be plenty of Honey made by the Bees
that year.</p>

<p class='c010'>They worship the Constellation <i>Ursa Minor</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_597'>597</span>They observe a very strange way of Purging; for with a Stick they thrust sharp
Leaves down their Throats into their Stomach, which they turn so long till they
vomit Blood.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their manner of Wrestling.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the Summer they have a general Meeting for Wrestling, and other Exercises,
which lasts three days. The Wrestlers are strangely attir’d; for they are all over
their Bodies beset with divers sorts of Feathers, and in stead of Boots or Buskins,
wear the Barks of Trees about their Legs; their Hair besmear’d with Honey, and
ty’d in a Tuft, hangs down behind; on their Crowns they wear a Plume of Feathers,
about their Necks a Band or Gorget of Feathers; at their Arms they tie the
Wings of the Birds <i>Kohitub</i>, and on their Backs a green Bough; their whole Bodies
Painted with divers Colours, and their Hair all Red: Thus accoutred, they
Engage one with another, and if there be an old Grudge between them, then they
Fight in earnest, and often kill one another: The Victor with strange Actions
upbraids the Vanquish’d with Cowardise, and ever after enjoys his Wife and
Children.</p>

<p class='c010'>They eat the Serpent <i>Manuah</i>, being four Yards long, and on the Tail having a
Horn, which with a push it thrusts into Man or Beast, as it lights, then winds it
self about the Body, and sucks till it hath suck’d the last drop of Blood.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here are also Serpents which are so poysonous, that the least Wound receiv’d by
them is mortal, unless the part bitten be either immediately cut out, or off.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Priests cut the deceased Bodies into pieces, which are roasted by old Women;
the Bones are taken out, and at the next publick Feast are stamp’d, mix’d
with Water, and Drank: But the Bodies of Noblemen are to be eaten by none
but Persons of that Rank.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their manner of Crowning their Kings.</div>

<p class='c010'>They also Crown their Kings after a strange manner, <i>viz.</i> The Priests, who are
beset with Feathers, anoint him with sweet-smelling Oyl, or Balsam, and put a
Crown of divers colour’d Feathers on his Head, after which they all fall a Singing
and Dancing; but if any one happen to speak a word of the deceased King, they all
begin to howl and cry. The Kings Authority consists more in Advising than
Commanding.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Opinions concerning the Soul.</div>

<p class='c010'>They believe that the Souls of those who die a natural Death are immortal;
but those that are kill’d by their Enemies, devour’d by ravenous Beasts, or
poyson’d, are totally extinguish’d both Soul and Body for ever. They say likewise
that Hell is Westward near a dark Pool, where the Devil Examines every
Soul how they liv’d on Earth, and what Death they dy’d; the Good are Ferry’d
over to a delightful Valley, where there is plenty of Fish, Honey, and Flesh; but
the Wicked are miserably tormented.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Natives live peaceably amongst themselves, their Law being for those that
have not, to ask, and for those that have, to give.</p>

<p class='c010'>They never Travel in the Night for fear of Serpents and other ravenous Beasts,
neither do they go any whither till the Sun has dry’d up the Dew.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>King <i>Janduy</i> his subtile Plot.</div>

<p class='c010'>King <i>Janduy</i> before-mention’d, being above a hundred years of age, desir’d the
Prince of <i>Juckers</i> fair Daughter to Wife,  but being deny’d, contriv’d a subtil Plot,
<i>viz.</i> he invited <i>Jucker</i>, with his Courtiers, to a Wresting; whither he coming with
his whole Train, was earnestly minding the Sport, when a considerable number of
<i>Janduy</i>’s Women falling upon <i>Jucker</i>’s Men, destroy’d a great many of them, and got
the desir’d Maid for <i>Janduy</i>, who at that time had fourteen Wives and sixty Children,
but had formerly enjoy’d fifty Wives and Concubines.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Arms.</div>

<p class='c010'>Not onely amongst the <i>Tapuyans</i>, but generally amongst the rest of the <i>Brasilians</i>,
their Arms are great Clubs call’d <i>Tacapes</i>; also sharp Darts, and strong Bowes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_598'>598</span>call’d <i>Orapares</i>, with Shields, which are made of the Skin of a Beast call’d <i>Tapiroussous</i>.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_694.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Women wear long Chains of Snail-shells, which hang down over their
Shoulders; their Faces are Painted with divers colour’d Rings, surrounded with
Specks; their Necks and Arms they adorn with Necklaces and Armlets of little
Bones: They carry their Husbands Provisions in time of War.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Army they order by blowing on the Horn <i>Inubia</i>; others play on Mens
Bones kill’d a little before: for going by Water they use Boats made of the Barks of
Trees, each whereof being able to carry fifty Men, go exceeding swift: The
strongest Men always march before, and as many as they take, whether Men, Women,
or Children, they are all kill’d and roasted in their <i>Boucans</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their manner of Fighting.</div>

<p class='c010'>Their Villages consist of Houses of eighty, ninety, or a hundred Paces long;
those that lie near the Enemy are fenc’d with Walls and Pallisado’s against any
Attempt. Their Field-Battels are very terrible; for as soon as they get sight of one
another, they howl like Wolves; which Tone they raise as they approach nearer
and nearer, and with their Horns and Pipes make also a mighty sound; then shaking
their former Enemies Teeth (which they wear about their Necks) at one another,
they cry, <i>That they shall immediately fall into each others hands for Food</i>: whereupon
they throw their Darts at one another, which are adorn’d with all sorts of Feathers,
and if any one be wounded, he pulls out the Dart, and bites the same like a mad
Dog; next falling to their Clubs, they knock one anothers Brains out: which
manner of Fighting lasts commonly some hours before the one or other Party leave
the Field. All their Prisoners they fatten, and eat them at a Merry-meeting; at
which when they have Danc’d seven hours together, three Men lead the Prisoner,
ty’d with a Rope made of the Bark of a Tree call’d <i>Juira</i>, through their Village,
whilest the Prisoner looking to and again, saith in a scornful manner thus unto
them, <i>You, do ye hear? I have eaten your Fathers</i>: and to others, <i>I have roasted your Brother;
your Nephew also tasted very well; my Death will be sufficiently reveng’d</i>: Having
carry’d him about for some time, they put the Rope so strait about his Middle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_599'>599</span>that he can neither stir one way nor other; then they give him Stones in his Hands,
and lay others at his Feet, saying, <i>Now take Revenge for your Death before you die</i>: then
he immediately throws at those who are nearest him; and when Stones are wanting,
he throws with Earth: at last comes the Executioner, adorn’d with Feathers,
with a black Club in his Hand, and asks, <i>Have not you at several times eaten of our Relations?</i>
to which the Prisoner undauntedly answers, <i>Pa che tan tan, ajouca, atoupave</i>,
that is, <i>Yes, I am he that have eaten several of your People</i>, and laying his Hands upon
his Head, cries out, <i>O how valiantly did I behave my self therein!</i> The Executioner replies,
<i>And therefore shall you be kill’d by me, and serve for Food for these Spectators</i>: Then
the Prisoner answers again, <i>What care I, since I know my Death will be reveng’d</i>: which
said, his Brains are dash’d out, and falling on the Ground, he is carry’d away by
his Wife (for the Conqueror commonly betroths his Sister or Daughter to the Prisoner,)
who seemingly bemoans the Body, of which she hath the first Cut when
it is Dress’d; then the old Women put the Corps into scalding Water, in which
they let it lie till the Skin comes off; then the Owner of the Prisoner quartering
the Body, distributes it amongst the Guests; the pieces laid on their Gridirons
call’d <i>Boucans</i>, are turn’d by the old Women, who lick up the Dripping, desiring
the By-standers to bring more such Food, and with the Blood anoint the Childrens
Faces; the Meat being broyl’d every one takes a piece, and eats it up to the Bones,
which are kept as Trophies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Brasilians</i> molested by an evil Spirit.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Brasilians</i> do not onely thus plague one another, but they are likewise tormented
by an evil Spirit, which they call <i>Aygnan</i> and <i>Caagerrel</i>, if credit may be given
to <i>John Leerius</i> a <i>Burgundian</i>, who relates, that he hath often seen them sweat
out of fear; and striking their Hands upon their Thighs, cry out, <i>Mair autourassap,
acequerey, Aygnan atoupave</i>, that is, <i>O my Fool, my Companion, I fear the Devil above all Evils</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Diseases peculiar to <i>Brasile</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Amongst several Diseases to which <i>Brasile</i> is subject, there is one call’d <i>Pians</i>,
as malignant as the <i>French <em class='gesperrt'>POX</em></i>, proceeding from libinousness, the whole
Body being full of Carbuncles, each about the bigness of a Man’s Thumb.</p>

<p class='c010'>Strangers in <i>Brasile</i> are also much troubled with a Giddiness, occasion’d by the
extream Cold in the Night; as also with sore Eyes, which they get by going
abroad before Sun-rising, or after Sun-setting.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Palsie is also very common there, taking People so suddenly, that falling
down stiff on the Ground, they are often in danger of losing their Breath.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides these there are several other Distempers that very much infest <i>Brasile</i>, as
the Bloody-flux, Dropsie, Rising of the Gall, Worms, Meazles, and St. <i>Anthony</i>’s
Fire.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Brasilians</i> success in curing of several Distempers by their knowledge in Herbs.</div>

<p class='c010'>The aged <i>Brasilians</i> have for the most part great skill in Herbs, which they gather
in the Woods, and apply them to the Sick both inwardly and outwardly;
and chiefly they know how to expel Poyson. None can perswade them against the
Medicines which they have learn’d from their Predecessors; nay, they will rather
chuse to lose their Lives than use any other: and indeed they do not always succeed
amiss, but often manifest that they understand the Vertue of Herbs better than our
<i>European</i> Physicians. The Learned <i>Guilielmus Piso</i> relates, That he hath seen several
times in the Army which <i>Grave Maurice</i> sent against the <i>Portuguese</i> in <i>Brasile</i>, that the
<i>Brasilians</i> in a short time cur’d those Wounds with fresh Gums and healing Herbs,
which the <i>Netherland</i> Chirurgeons judging past Cure, presently advis’d the cutting
off either the Arm or Leg of the wounded Person. <i>Piso</i> adds moreover, That he
himself us’d some of <i>Hippocrates</i>’s and <i>Galen</i>’s Prescriptions in Wine, for the curing
of Cancers and Swellings, which the <i>Brasilians</i> have made well onely with the Juice
of Tobacco. They also in a moment recover’d a Person given over by all <i>European</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_600'>600</span>Physicians, with the Juice of the Root call’d <i>Jaborandi</i>: Wherefore he always desir’d
their Company when he went to visit sick or wounded Men.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their manner of curing the Sick, and bewailing the Dead.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Distempers in <i>America</i> differ much from the <i>European</i>, not onely in the Signs
of any Distemper, but also in the Cure; for when a Distemper cannot be cur’d by
the prescribed Medicines, a Father or Mother sends for the Neighbors, to know if
they can find any means to cure the Disease: Which Custom was anciently observ’d
amongst the <i>Greeks</i>. They also strictly observe a Rule in their Diet, and
take care to keep the Patient out of the Sun in the Day, and cold Winds in the
Night: However, if their Fathers and Mothers be sick, nevertheless they leave not
off their usual Dancing and Singing; but if the sick Person die, especially a Father,
they lament and cry over the Corps like Wolves, calling to one another with a
quavering Voice, and uttering these Expressions, <i>The strong Man is deceas’d, who
carry’d so many Prisoners for a brave Dinner to his House. Oh what a quick Hunter and
subtil Fisher hath Death bereav’d us of! we shall see him no more till our Souls are carry’d beyond
the high Mountains, where our valiant Predecessors Dance in Rings.</i> The Women
make the greatest noise, and in the midst of their howling embrace one another,
which lasts six hours, and then they put the Body upright into a Grave made like a
Hogshead, hanging about it divers colour’d Feathers, and other things in which
the Deceased delighted most when living; upon the Grave the nearest Relations
place Dishes of Meat, both Flesh and Fish, and the Liquor <i>Cauou-in</i>, that their evil
Spirit call’d <i>Aygnan</i>, may be reconcil’d by these Offerings, and not carry away the
Body; but when they remove from thence they cover the Grave with the Herb
<i>Pindo</i>. This Custom is not observ’d by all <i>Brasilians</i>, for some eat up their deceased
Relations.</p>

<h4 id='c600' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. XIII.</span><br /> Grave Maurice <i>his Account of</i> Brasile, <i>so far as it concern’d the</i> West-India <i>Company</i>.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'><i>Brasile</i>, so far as it concerns the <i>West-India</i> Company, extends from the River
<i>Real</i>, which divides <i>Seregippa</i> and the Lordship of St. <i>Salvador</i>, to <i>Maragnan</i>:
<i>Seregippa</i> it self reaches along the Sea-Coast thirty two Leagues, and was
first brought under the King of <i>Spain</i>’s Jurisdiction by <i>Christovan de Barros Cardoso</i>,
who being order’d by the King of <i>Spain</i> to Plant this new Countrey, invited many
People from St. <i>Salvador</i>, who built four Sugar-Mills, and a Town consisting of
a hundred Houses, and four hundred Sheds for Cattel; but the Town being destroy’d,
hath nothing left but Heaps of Rubbish; and the Cattel either fell into the
<i>Netherlanders</i> hands, or were devour’d by Tygers; the Inhabitants fled back to
St. <i>Salvador</i>: Many troubles have prevented the re-building of it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The fertility of <i>Pernambuco</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Pernambuco</i> may for its fruitfulness stand in competition with any Place in the
World, except in those parts where the Soil is sandy and stonie. The Fields
feed abundance of excellent Cattel; the Woods, Deer and Fowl; the Ocean and
Rivers, all manner of good Fish. It is inhabited but eight Leagues into the Countrey,
because the nearer the Sea, the more convenient it is for Importing and
Exporting of Goods; neither could the <i>Portuguese</i>, by reason of their small number,
spread themselves farther, as also in regard they found great resistance from the
<i>Brasilians</i>. The <i>Negro</i>’s that work in the Sugar-Mills between the River <i>Grande</i>
and <i>Francisco</i>, amount to four thousand. The Cape <i>Verde</i>, <i>Mina</i>, <i>Angola</i>, <i>Ardra</i>, and
<i>Calabaria</i>, generally provide three thousand in a year, to supply the number of the
Sick, or those that run away.</p>

  <h4 id='c601' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. XIV.</span><br /> <i>The Councellor</i> Dussen’<i>s Relation of so much of</i> Brasile <i>as concerns the</i> West-India <i>Company</i>.</h4>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>That part of <i>Brasile</i> which the <i>West-India</i> Company have subdu’d by force of
Arms on the Continent of <i>America</i>, is divided into six Counties, <i>viz.</i> <i>Seregippa</i>,
<i>Pernambuco</i>, <i>Itamarica</i>, <i>Parayba</i>, <i>Rio Grande</i>, and <i>Siara</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Expedition undertaken by <i>Gysseling</i> and <i>Schuppe</i> made <i>Seregippa</i> desolate, the
Inhabitants whereof remov’d to the Coast <i>Todos los Sanctos</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Also <i>Siara</i>, which the <i>Portuguese</i> formerly possess’d, was thinly inhabited, and
had a mean Fortress there, whither some few <i>Brasilians</i> came now and then to the
<i>Netherlanders</i> assistance.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Pernambuco</i>, lying between the Rivers <i>Francisco</i> and <i>Tamarica</i>, excells the other
Countrey in fruitfulness and pleasantness. The <i>Brasilians</i> compare it to a hollow
Rock, under which fresh Water flows.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Havens of <i>Pernambuco</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, <i>Pernambuco</i> hath several Havens, <i>viz.</i> the outermost Road before <i>Reciffa</i>,
which being in the open Sea, is somewhat dangerous, but the innermost is
secure against all Storms; also at the Promontory St. <i>Augustine</i>, where the Mouth
of the Haven is narrow and dangerous, by reason of the Rocks and shallow Grounds;
the Island <i>Alexio</i> is very fit to Crain Ships in; <i>Barra Grande</i> hath a large and safe
Inlet, convenient for all manner of Vessels, yet it is inferior to <i>Cororipa</i>; lastly, the
Havens <i>Jaragoa</i> and <i>Franco</i> are very eminent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rivers.</div>

<p class='c010'>Amongst the Rivers, the chief are <i>Jangades</i>, <i>Serinhain</i>, <i>Formosa</i>, <i>Porto Calvo</i>, <i>Camarigibi</i>,
<i>Antonio</i>, <i>Michael</i>, and <i>Francisco</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Pernambuco</i> also is divided into six Jurisdictions; the first and most ancient is
<i>Igarazu</i>; the second and biggest, <i>Olinda</i>; the third, <i>Serinhain</i>; the fourth, <i>Porto
Calvo</i>; the fifth, the <i>Alagoas</i>; and the sixth, <i>Rio Francisco</i>, which is the Boundary
of <i>Pernambuco</i> on the South.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns of <i>Pernambuco</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Pernambuco</i> also boasts five Towns, <i>viz.</i> <i>Garasu</i>, <i>Olinda</i>, <i>Maurice-stadt</i>, to which
also belongs <i>Reciffa</i>, <i>Bella Pojuca</i>, and <i>Formosa</i>. The Villages <i>Moribeca</i>, <i>St. Laurence</i>,
<i>Antonio</i>, <i>Amaro</i>, and others are also not inferior to little Towns.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey is for the most part Hilly, but is exceeding fruitful in the Valleys,
and near the Rivers, especially in Sugar-Canes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here are also a hundred and twenty Sugar-Mills, of which a great number stand
still for want of <i>Negro</i>’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next <i>Pernambuco</i> lies <i>Tamarica</i>, which hath onely one Haven, one City, and
twenty three Sugar-Mills, of which thirty are onely employ’d. This Island produces
excellent Grapes and Melons, yet is for the most part barren, by reason of the
Pismires.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey <i>Parayba</i> hath its Denomination from the River which washeth
it, being deep, and without any Rocks or Sands; on the Banks thereof stand twenty
Sugar-Mills, two of which are still standing.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Lordship of <i>Rio Grande</i> stands the Town <i>Puntael</i>, whose Buildings were
ruin’d in the Wars; after which the Inhabitants had leave to build them another
City on a fruitful Soil.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey hereabouts us’d formerly to be very full of Cattel, but was not
onely bereav’d thereof by the <i>Hollanders</i> and <i>Portuguese</i>, but also for the most part
made desolate.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_602'>602</span>The River which washes the Castle Ceulen, affords a convenient and safe Harbor
for all sorts of Vessels.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Lordship of <i>Rio Grande</i> boasts onely two Sugar-Mills, of which one is decay’d;
so that in all those Parts in <i>Brasile</i> which belong to the <i>West-India</i> Company,
are a hundred and sixty Sugar-Mills constantly employ’d,  besides forty six which
are about repairing. It is scarce to be reckon’d how much Sugar they make yearly,
in regard, through the alterations of the annual Seasons, as also the more or less
fruitful Fields, they produce one year, and in one place, more than in another.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Inhabitants are of two sorts, <i>viz.</i> free People, and Slaves; the Slaves are
<i>African Negro</i>’s, and the others, <i>Netherlanders</i>, <i>Portugueses</i>, or <i>Brasilians</i>; which last
came in of their own accords, or else were absolv’d from their Oaths, and acquitted
from their Martial Offices; yet are ready to venture their Lives and Estates,
and to Serve either on Foot or Horseback for their Freedom against their Enemies.
Those that went from the <i>Netherlands</i> to <i>Brasile</i> on their own Accounts, drive a
Trade, or Serve the Traders, or else keep Inns, and follow Handicraft Faculties;
some of which, when grown rich, buy Parts in Sugar-Mills; others live on Tilling:
by all which several sorts of People <i>Reciffa</i> is very well inhabited, and full of Houses,
which yield great Rents, and are held at high Prices: wherefore <i>Grave Maurice</i>
thought good to mark out pieces of Ground on the Isle <i>Antonio Vaes</i>, which were
sold for a considerable Sum of Money, insomuch that in a short time a new City
call’d <i>Maurice-stadt</i> was built on the same, and inclos’d within strong Bulwarks;
yea, notwithstanding the Rumor of a great <i>Spanish</i> Fleet in some measure abated the
Courage of the Builders, yet the City was extended down to the Fort <i>Frederick
Henrick</i>, and a brave Bridge laid over the Stream <i>Biberibi</i>, cross which they go from
<i>Reciffa</i> to <i>Antonio Vaes</i>, where no People were in greater esteem than Handicraftsmen,
who could get their ten or twelve Shillings a day. The Labor which is requir’d
in the Sugar-Mills, no Men are able to undergo but the <i>Negro</i>’s. Of the
<i>Portuguese</i> some have liv’d here a considerable time; others lately came hither, being
most of them <i>Jews</i>, of whom there live a great many at <i>Reciffa</i>, and are very diligent
in promoting of Trade: They possess several Sugar-Mills, and are kept very
much under; their whole study and contrivance is for Gain; they conceal their
Hatred against the <i>Christians</i>, as also their Covetousness, yet are mortal Enemies to
the <i>Hollanders</i>. The <i>Brasilians</i>, who are the ancient Inhabitants, live apart from
other People in their Villages, consisting of long Straw Huts, forty or fifty of them
under one Roof sleeping on woven Hammocks; they esteem no Houshold-stuff but
Nets and <i>Calabashes</i>, using the first to fish with, and the other to drink out of; about
their Huts they plant <i>Mandihoka</i> and <i>Brasile</i> Trees; when they are not employ’d in
the Wars, they spend most of their time in Hunting, but many in Idleness; they
esteem wild Fruits better than those which are Planted; they Drink night and
day, making their Liquor of the chew’d Root <i>Mandihoka</i>, or the Apples <i>Tajovis</i>;
they esteem nothing so much as strong Drink, and to wear Linnen next their Skins;
they would not value Money, could they but get Brandy and <i>Spanish</i> Wine without
it; if they are not promis’d a Reward, they will not work. Each Village,
nay House, hath its peculiar Governor; but besides him there is a <i>Hollander</i>, who
stirs up the Idle to work, and takes care that the Owners of the Sugar-Mills do
them no injury: They never suffer themselves to be Hir’d for above twenty days,
at the end whereof they demand their Wages; they are commonly employ’d to
chop Wood to boyl the Sugar with; but by reason of the scarcity of <i>Negros</i>, they
are often made use of for other Business, which to avoid they hide themselves; as
also when they are to go to Fight; they are hard to be kept in Ranks, for they will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_603'>603</span>run out of their own Fyle into another on the least occasion; but if they put their
Enemy to flight, they pursue him, and spare none alive. They little regard the
<i>Christian</i> Religion, yet some of them have learn’d the <i>Lord’s-Prayer</i> and the <i>Creed</i> of
the <i>Roman</i> Priests. The Minister <i>Davil</i> having learn’d the <i>Brasilian</i> Tongue, Converted
very many of them, and Baptiz’d them in their Villages.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Brasilian</i> Women and Children usually go to Wars with their Husbands
and Fathers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Brasilian</i> Slaves were some years since bought of the <i>Tapuyans</i>, or made
Slaves, because they assisted <i>Boudewyn Henrickszoon</i>, when he Landed in the Inlet <i>Traluson</i>;
but they have since obtain’d their Freedom of the <i>Portuguese</i>. The <i>Angolan</i>
Slaves can undergo greater Labor than any other.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Brasile</i> Wood grows generally ten or twelve Leagues up in the Countrey
from the Sea, not in particular Woods, but amongst other Trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Negro</i>’s, when the Sugar-Mills work not, are employ’d in pulling off the
white Bark, three Fingers thick, from the Tree, which bears dark-green Leaves,
small and prickly at the ends, and hanging on thin Stalks, but bearing neither Blossoms
nor Fruit.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Osnabrig</i> Linnen is highly esteem’d amongst the <i>Brasilians</i>, as also colour’d Wax,
Copper, Tin, Wine, Beer, Butter, Cheese, Meal, Stock-fish, Pork, Hung-beef, and
Gammons of Bacon.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Papists</i> Teach and observe their Religion in publick, their Spiritual Men
being divided into Priests and Monks; the Monks consist of <i>Franciscans</i>, <i>Carmelites</i>,
and <i>Benedictines</i>; the <i>Franciscans</i> being the most eminent, possess six fair Cloysters,
besides which they have neither Land nor other Revenues, but live on what is given
them daily; their Cloysters stand in <i>Frederick-stadt</i>, <i>Iguaraca</i>, <i>Olinda</i>, <i>Pojuca</i>, <i>Serinhain</i>,
and <i>Antonio Vaes</i>. But the <i>Carmelites</i> have three Structures at <i>Parayba</i>, and as
many more in <i>Frederick-stadt</i> and <i>Olinda</i>, where they live plentifully on what they
reap from Tillage, Rents of Houses, and Legacies of deceased Persons. The <i>Benedictins</i>,
though they possess onely two Cloysters, one in <i>Frederick-stadt</i>, and the other
at <i>Olinda</i>, yet they have the greatest Income from the Sugar-Mills of <i>Muserapa</i>, and
the Countrey about <i>Parayba</i>, as also Cattel and Cane-Fields.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Reciffa</i>, the Seat of War, hath two Horn-works towards <i>Olinda</i>; the first rais’d
with Stone, defends the Haven with seven Brass Demi-Culverins; the other lies
opposite to the River <i>Biberi</i>, and hath five Brass and two Iron Guns. <i>Reciffa</i> also
hath a strong Rail about it, and many Guns plac’d in good order. Near the Powder-house
stand two Batteries with Guns.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the Shore towards <i>Olinda</i>, lies the Stone Castle <i>St. Joris</i>, on a Hill opposite
to the Haven, fortifi’d with a Bulwark and thirteen Iron Guns.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Water-Castle, built round, rises out of the Sea, and stands at the end of
the Stone Cliff, which makes an Inlet, through which the Ships Sail that come
to, and go from <i>Reciffa</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Fort <i>Bruine</i> hath four Points, seven Brass Guns, and Pallisados round
about.</p>

<p class='c010'>Somewhat farther is the Redoubt call’d <i>The Lady Bruine</i>, which hath two Brass
Guns.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Castle <i>Waerdenbergh</i>, built before the Mouth of the River <i>Capivaribi</i>, in the
Bay made by the River <i>Biberibi</i>, hath three Points, each rais’d square, because the
fourth Bulwark towards <i>Antonio Vaes</i>, cannot be finish’d, by reason the Earth is
sunk away.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_604'>604</span>Vaez</i>. That part of the City which respects the Fort, lies open, with five
Points and a double Horn-work; it is the more secure from any Invasion, because
the Countrey round about is overflow’d at High-water. On the Horn-work stand
eight Brass Guns; but the four Redoubts along the River <i>Capivaribi</i> are decay’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>The square Fort <i>Prince William</i>, standing in a low Ground not far from the River
<i>Afogados</i>, hath four Bulwarks, and is inclos’d with a high Wall and strong Pallisado’s:
the Church appearing above all other Houses in the Castle, may be seen at

<p class='c010'><i>Maurice-stadt</i> lies pleasantly along the River <i>Biberibi</i>, and is wash’d behind by the
River <i>Capivaribi</i>; It hath a large Wharf, a brave Magazine, a <i>French</i> Church, and
a Guild-hall: The Buildings are not altogether so high as those in <i>Reciffa</i>, where
they are commonly three Stories, because the Ground is very dear.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Grave Maurice</i>’s Court lying opposite to <i>Reciffa</i>, on the Shore of <i>Biberibi</i>, rises
from the middle of a Garden with two high Towers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not far from the Castle <i>Ernestus</i> is a Potters Kiln, and on the other side, near the
Fort <i>Frederick Henrick</i> seven Wells, and some Morasses, and towards the Water-side,
a Stone Battery.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Forts of <i>Brasile</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Fort <i>Orange</i> at the Southern Mouth of the Haven, hath, by reason of its dry
Moats, a strong Pallisado, four Bulwarks, and twelve Guns. The Bulwarks about
the Church, and the Battery before the Haven, also secures <i>Schuppen-stadt</i> against the
<i>Portuguese</i>. On the Battery stand nine Iron and two Brass Guns. At the Northern
Entrance of the Haven appears a Tower with three Guns.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Fort <i>Margareta</i> hath two Brass and forty Iron Guns.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Restringa</i>, surrounded with Pallisado’s, rises near a sandy Point in the middle of
the River.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Castle <i>Antonio</i>, wash’d by the Sea, hath onely one Tower, but that sufficiently
strong to defend it against an Enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Franciscan</i> Cloyster, strengthned by a Wall and Earthen Works, serve in
stead of a Castle to <i>Frederick-stadt</i>, and is the more secure by reason of a Half-Moon,
Moats, Rails, and a Battery at the Mouth of the Haven.</p>

<p class='c010'>The stonie Fortification of <i>Ceulen</i> lies near the Sea. All these are the Fortresses
of the Northern <i>Brasile</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>To the Southward of <i>Reciffa</i> appears the Promontory <i>St. Augustine</i>, where the
Haven is secur’d by the Forts <i>Vander Dussen</i>, <i>Domburgh</i>, and a Stone Battery.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Fort <i>Maurice</i> Commands the Ferry of <i>Rio Francisco</i>, and is built on a high
and steep Hill, with five Bulwarks; the lowermost Plain is overflow’d by the
River in the Summer Season. The Store-houses hereabouts are ill furnish’d, and
if not suddenly supply’d, ’tis to be fear’d, that a great Famine will follow, as already
it is begun, and we may thank the faint-heartedness of the Enemy that it
hath increas’d no more.</p>

three thousand Men, besides seven hundred which they brought from <i>St. Salvador</i>;
the Duke of <i>Bagnola</i> was also ready with two thousand <i>Portugueses</i>, and a

from <i>Parayba</i>, <i>Pernambuco</i>, <i>Seregippa</i>, <i>Itamarica</i>, <i>Rio Grande</i>, and <i>Siara</i>, contrary to the
Oath taken in <i>Reciffa</i>: But the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet keeping close to the Bay <i>Todos los Sanctos</i>,
hath hitherto done nothing, except the sending of several Companies into the
Countrey, to rob and pillage the <i>Brasilian</i> Villages. Moreover, the <i>Mulatto</i>’s and
<i>Negro</i>’s do great mischief up and down, and so much the more, because they go
and come along private Ways, through which none can follow them. Most of the
Ships being badly fitted, are scarce able to keep the Sea; and the Soldiers want
Clothes exceedingly. The City <i>St. Salvador</i> keeps the Countrey in a continual
Alarm, so that five thousand Men are requir’d to conquer it: Eighteen great
Ships, and as many Ketches, besides lesser Vessels, ought to be sent thither, the Sea
being full of Pyrats. The common Treasury is so much behind-hand, that none
can receive any Pay. The Owners of the Sugar-Mills will not deliver any Sugar
without ready Money, because of the <i>Netherlanders</i> removal from thence.</p>

<h4 id='c605' class='c013'><i>A Description, of the Palace</i> Freyburgh, <i>two Bridges, and a Banquetting-house, all built by</i> Grave Maurice.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'><i>Grave Maurice</i> before his coming away from <i>Brasile</i>, built a pleasant Palace
along the River <i>Biberibi</i>, before the Fort <i>Ernestus</i> on <i>Antonio Vaes</i>; the outmost
Work whereof was shaded by a double Row of <i>Coco</i>-Trees, and had
a Pond full of all sorts of Fish; and not far from thence, on one side, a second encompass’d
a Coney-Warren, which respected a pell-mell; near it a Garden, curiously
divided into round <i>Parterres</i>, which led into a long Park of <i>Bakkoven</i>-Trees;
and at the end a great Dove-house. Next the River stood a large Stable, on one
side whereof was a Field to whiten Linnen in, and a Kitchin-Garden wherein was
a large Spot full of Orange-Trees, a row of Vines, which bore Grapes every three
Moneths, and a delightful Walk, beset on each side with Lime-Trees. On the
other side of this Palace stood a Banquetting-house, near a row of Pome-granate-Trees,
and another of Fig and Cittron-Trees. Behind the Palace was a Fish-pond
with two Iles, for the Swans. A Dove-house also appear’d near the Fort <i>Ernestus</i>,
where the <i>Negro</i>’s watch’d the Horses, and led them to Water in a Fishpond in a
large Wood. Before the Palace appear’d a Stone Pallisado, which like a Half-Moon
ran into the River. The Palace it self rose with two Towers, one of
which serv’d for a Sea-mark.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_606'>606</span>Moreover, <i>Grave Maurice</i> extended his new City to the Fort <i>Frederick Henrick</i>, divided
the Morassie Grounds by several Moats, and laid a Bridge cross the River
<i>Biberibi</i>, between <i>Reciffa</i> and the City <i>Maurice</i>, another cross the Stream <i>Capivaribi</i>,
between the said City <i>Maurice</i> and the Main Land.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the time when <i>Albuquerque</i> Govern’d <i>Brasile</i> for the King of <i>Spain</i>, it was Disputed
among the <i>Portuguese</i>, whether it were not requisite to desert the City <i>Olinda</i>,
and causing the Inhabitants to remove to <i>Reciffa</i>, joyn the same with a Bridge to the
Isle <i>Antonio Vaes</i>, because those Places are almost invincible, and much more convenient
for Ships than <i>Olinda</i>? But the <i>Hollanders</i> surpris’d them on a sudden, before
they could bring the Business to pass, and after a while prosecuted the same Design
themselves.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Grave Maurice</i> his stately Bridge over the River <i>Biberibi</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Grave Maurice</i> spent twenty four thousand <i>Guilders</i> in laying a Bridge over the
River <i>Biberibi</i>, between <i>Reciffa</i> and <i>Antonio Vaes</i>. Having rais’d just fifteen Stone
Columns from the Ground, they came to the deepest part of the River <i>Antonio Vaes</i>,
when the Architect began to despair of accomplishing the same, because the
Ground lay deep under Water, and the Stream ran very swift: Those which dwelt
at <i>Reciffa</i> cry’d, <i>That they had undertaken a Business which was not in the power of Man to
effect, and that there was above ten thousand Pound already spent in vain on fifteen Pillars</i>:
In this sort they began to clamor against <i>Grave Maurice</i>, especially the Owners of
Houses in <i>Reciffa</i>, who foresaw that many would remove from thence to the pleasant
Isle <i>Antonio Vaes</i>, as soon as the Bridge was finish’d; after which the Houses in
<i>Reciffa</i> would be at low Rates. But <i>Grave Maurice</i> judging that the Disgrace would
fall upon him, if the Bridge should be left half finish’d, caus’d at his own proper
Charge, huge pieces of lasting Timber to be cut, forty and fifty Foot long, and so
ramm’d into the Ground, some streight, others sloaping, to support the rest, and
in two Moneths finish’d the same. On the first day after this new Bridge was
compleated, there went so many People over it, that the Toll which they paid,
amounted to above 60 l. <i>Sterl.</i> and was after that Farm’d for twenty eight thousand
<i>Guilders</i> yearly, a Citizen that pass’d over the same being to pay 2 <i>d.</i> and a
Negro or Soldier 1 <i>d.</i> but a Horseman paid 4 <i>d.</i> and a Cart or Wayn 7 <i>d.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Another over the River <i>Capivaribi</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Since this <i>Grave Maurice</i> built a second Bridge cross the River <i>Capivaribi</i>, which
joyn’d <i>Antonio Vaez</i> to the Main Continent. This Bridge being eighty six Rods
long of durable Timber, was finish’d in seven Weeks.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>His Pleasure-house <i>Bonavista</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover <i>Grave Maurice</i> built a pleasant Banquetting-house, call’d <i>Bonavista</i>, at
his own Charge before the said Bridge, from whence he could see the Palace <i>Freyburgh</i>,
<i>Olinda</i>, the Fort <i>Ernestus</i>, <i>Maurice-stadt</i>, <i>Reciffa</i>, the <i>French</i> Church, the Ships
in the Harbors, and also the Castle <i>Frederick Henrick</i>. This Banquetting-house
hath at each corner a Turret, and in the middle thereof a spacious Room, crown’d
with a fair Terrace.</p>

<h3 id='c607' class='c001'>CHAP. VIII.<br /> Guiana.</h3>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Description of <i>Guiana</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Northward of <i>Brasile</i>, over against <i>Maragnan</i>, the Countrey of <i>Guiana</i>,
not improbably suppos’d to be so call’d from the River <i>Wia</i>, one of the
principal Rivers of the Province, which yet is said to have more and fairer
than any other part of <i>America</i> besides: It is by some call’d <i>The Wild Coast</i>, for what
reason is uncertain, it being found to be a very fruitful and pleasant Countrey:
It is Bounded on the East with the <i>Atlantick</i> Ocean, or <i>Mare del Nordt</i>; on the
West, with some undiscover’d mountainous Countreys, which lie on that side of
the <i>Andes</i>, on the North it hath the great River <i>Orenoque</i>; and on the South
that of the <i>Amazons</i>, or <i>Orellana</i>; which last Name, as we have said before, it derives
from <i>Francisco Orellana</i>, who is said to have first discover’d it in the Year 1543.
It was anciently call’d <i>Tobo</i>, <i>Topoi</i>, and <i>Tapera</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey lieth on both sides of the <i>Æquator</i>, extended from the fourth
Degree of Southern Latitude, to the eighth Degree of Northern, yet enjoyeth a
temperate and good Air, not oppressed with any excessive Heat; which is chiefly
attributed to the Breezes or Easterly Winds, almost perpetually about Noon
blowing upon it. Towards the Sea-side it is for the most part a flat and level
Countrey, in the more Inland parts mountainous and swell’d with Hills, but in all
it is generally of such a rich and fertile Soil, that for Fruits, or any outward Commodities
of the Earth, it yields not to any other Province of the <i>New World</i>, but rather
far excelleth the most, having as it were a continual Summer, without Winter
or Autumn, the Trees never uncloth’d or made bare, Fruits always ripe, or
growing to maturity, the Meadows and Pastures always verdant and green, and,
as we said, so excellently well water’d with Rivers, that no Countrey in the World
seems comparable to it in this respect. But since the several Occurrences of <i>Orellana</i>’s
Expedition will give much light to the more particular knowledge of these
Parts, we thought good to insert this following Relation thereof.</p>

<h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. II.</span><br /> <i>A Relation of the Journey of</i> Francisco Orellana.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'><i>Francisco Orellana</i> travelling with <i>Gonsalvo Pizarro</i> from <i>Quito</i>, to find out the
Countrey <i>Cundirumarca</i> (where the Natives, according to the information of
a strange <i>American</i>, went Arm’d with Golden Plates) he came after a great
deal of hardship to the River <i>Maranon</i>, where <i>Pizarro</i> building a Brigantine, put all
his sick and maimed Men into the same, as also all his Baggage under the Command
of <i>Orellana</i>, whom he commanded to forage for some Provisions, of which
the Army, that was to follow along the Shore, had great want; but <i>Orellana</i> was in
few days driven down so far, that he saw no hopes of getting up again in a years
time, and Engag’d daily with the <i>Indians</i>, which came aboard of him in little Boats;
at last he went ashore and conquer’d a Village, in which he found Provisions, some
Gold, and Gems of great value: Not long after which he was in great danger, by
reason of a River, which with great force fell into the Channel in which he Sail’d,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_608'>608</span>and for the space of two hundred Leagues saw neither Man nor House: Next Landing
at a Village, he was by the Governor thereof Presented with Turtles, Partridges,
Fish, and other Provisions, and also forewarn’d of the valiant Women, the
<i>Amazones</i>, which they call’d <i>Camapuyara</i>. Going from hence, he met for eighty
Leagues together, nothing but steep and craggy Mountains on each side of the
Shore, insomuch that he could not Land any where for Provisions. Next coming
to the inhabited Province <i>Machiparo</i>, he was fiercely assaulted for two days and
two nights, by the Casique <i>Aomagua</i>, who pursu’d him with several Boats: Not
long after having conquer’d a Village, out of which ran several trodden Paths into
the Countrey, he came to a River, in the Mouth whereof there lying three Isles, he
gave it the Denomination of <i>La Trinidad</i>,  which washeth a fruitful Coast, along
which Sail’d divers small Vessels. Somewhat farther in the River <i>Trinidad</i> stood a
Village and Banquetting-house, where <i>Orellana</i> took abundance of Provisions, Silver,
Gold, and Earthen Ware curiously Glaz’d and Painted, but judg’d it very hazardous
to travel far into the Countrey by the common High-ways, in regard of the
multitudes of People that frequented them, to whose Civility he durst not trust;
therefore Sailing from hence a hundred Leagues farther, he came to the Countrey
belonging to the Lord of <i>Paguana</i>, who civilly Entertain’d him, and Presented
him with Sheep, not unlike the <i>Peruvians</i>, and all manner of good Fruit, which the
Countrey affords in great abundance. After this on his Lar-board side he discover’d
a River, whose being black like Ink, and disemboguing into another, discolour’d
the Water thereof for the space of twenty Leagues; he also saw several Villages,
and at last found the Stream to be so broad, that he could not see from one
Shore to the other: he took one of the Villages without any resistance, there being
none but Women in the Huts, whither the Men came towards the Evening. Near
another Village he espy’d seven Heads sticking upon Poles, from whence the Province
receiv’d the Denomination <i>De las Picotas</i>, from whence ran several pav’d
Ways, on each side planted with Trees, into the Countrey; where Landing, he
furnish’d himself with <i>Maiz</i>, Turtles, Geese, and Parrots, and at <i>Can</i> Island took
an <i>American</i> Prisoner, who inform’d him, that he was in the <i>Amazones’</i> Jurisdiction,
and that up in the Countrey liv’d a People not unlike the <i>Spaniards</i>, amongst whom
were two white Women, brought thither up the River by a Lord. Going farther
he saw divers Villages on each side of him, and at last Landing in a little Town,
he found plenty of Oats, Liquor made of Oats, Cotton, Linnen, a Temple hung
round about with Arms, and two Episcopal Miters of divers colours. Near a Promontory
jutting out into the River, the Tide went so strong, that he was not able
to Land; upon the Point stood several fair Buildings, where were also white
Women, of a big stature, with long Hair, who animated the Men to fight. This
Countrey, which extends it self a hundred and fifty Leagues along the Shore, with
Hills, Pasture-Grounds, and Champain, and well inhabited, being discover’d on
<i>St. John</i>’s Day, was call’d <i>The Province De San Juan</i>; which leaving, he came to several
Isles, the biggest whereof extended fifty Leagues in length, all of them standing
on high Ground, pleasant, and full of People, who in Boats, by them call’d
<i>Periagues</i>, valiantly Engag’d with the <i>Spaniards</i>; but one of them not long after being
taken Prisoner, inform’d them, that the <i>Amazones</i> dwelt in Stone Houses, Wall’d
Towns, had plenty of Silver and Gold, and four stately Temples enrich’d with
Plates, Dedicated to the Sun. But <i>Orellana</i> Sailing a hundred Leagues farther, along
a Coast belonging to the Lord of <i>Caripuna</i>, according to the Prisoner’s Relation, the
Inhabitants hereabouts shot abundance of poyson’d Arrows at the <i>Spaniards</i>, but
they made a shift to escape them, and Sailing within sight of Land into the Bay
of <i>Paria</i>, they came to an Anchor before the Island <i>Cubugua</i>, Anno 1541. after they
had been eight hundred Leagues.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>He dies with Grief.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_609'>609</span><i>Orellana</i> informing the <i>Spanish</i> Court of his Adventures, desir’d the chief Command
of the Province of the <i>Amazones</i>, which after earnest Sollicitations he obtain’d,
and accordingly setting Sail from <i>St. Lucar</i>, he went to the Island <i>Teneriff</i>
with three Ships and five hundred Men, where he stay’d three Moneths, and two
on <i>Cape de Verd</i>. On <i>Teneriff</i> several of his Men ran from him, and on <i>Cape de Verd</i>
he bury’d ninety eight, and left fifty sick behind him; yet he Steer’d to <i>Brasile</i>,
where, meeting with contrary Winds, he had undoubtedly perish’d for lack of
Water, if the great Showers of Rain had not supply’d his Wants, one of his Ships
carrying seventy Men and eleven Horses, was never heard of, with the other two he
Sail’d by <i>Baxos de San Roque</i>, and from thence a hundred Leagues Northwardly beyond
<i>Maragnan</i>, where a great way off at Sea they found fresh Water, in which
<i>Orellana</i> Steering, got between the Isles into the River <i>De las Amazones</i>, where he
Barter’d for Provisions, Sail’d two Leagues up the River, and came to an Anchor
before a few Huts, but slenderly stor’d with Provisions, where he spent three
Moneths in breaking up one of his Ships, and building a Ketch. In the mean time
fifty seven of his Seamen dy’d. Sailing twenty Leagues farther, he lost his best
Ship; whereupon he gave order to build a Barque of the Wreck. Thus he spent
thirty days in vain to find the fore mention’d Arm of the River <i>Amazones</i>: the
Barque being finish’d in ten Weeks, and going beyond the Isles <i>Maribique</i> and <i>Contan</i>,
found the three great Rivers to disembogue into the River <i>Amazones</i>, which there
was twelve Leagues broad; but wanting Provisions, and the Men being too weak
to go farther, they came back to the fruitful Island <i>Comao</i>, where a hundred <i>Spaniards</i>
setled themselves, the rest going down with the Barque to find out <i>Orellana</i>,
who, as his Wife inform’d them, dy’d with Grief.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>English</i> and <i>Netherlanders</i>, who Sail’d hither after the <i>Spaniards</i> left off, ascribe
a Breadth of fifty or sixty Leagues to the Mouth of the <i>Amazone</i> River, which discharges
its Water with such force into the Northern Ocean, that it keeps its colour
and taste above thirty Leagues, according to the ocular testimony of Captain <i>Harcourt</i>.
The Western Point, by the <i>Netherlanders</i> call’d <i>The North Cape</i>, runs with a
long Slip of low Land into the Sea, into which more North-Westerly fall the
Streams <i>Taponnowyny</i>, <i>Arowary</i>, <i>Arykary</i>, <i>Cassepouri</i>, and <i>Wiapoca</i>; some of them wash
great Wildernesses full of Trees; others glide between pleasant Meadows.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eighty Leagues up the <i>Amazone</i> River the <i>Vlussingers</i> have built a Fort call’d
<i>Nassaw</i>, on the narrow Island <i>Cogemines</i>, which is twenty Leagues long, and separated
from the Shore by a Creek, and seven Leagues farther, on another Isle, the Fort
<i>Orange</i>; from which two Forts they Trade with the Natives, <i>Arowaccas</i> and <i>Apehous</i>,
bartering <i>European</i> Trifles for Tobacco, Cotton, Sugar, Gums, and several
Tinctures.</p>

Ragapo</i>, some years before Baptiz’d in <i>England</i>, and then Governor of the Province

and conducted him fifty Leagues up into the Countrey, to the Mountain
<i>Cowob</i>, on whose top is a deep Pool, full of well tasted Fish, and surrounded with
the glittering Stones <i>Topaz</i>; which <i>Raleigh</i> took the more notice of, because the

Moreover, the Province <i>Cooshebery</i> rises with pleasant Hills, but consists

upon the Fish, that they suffer themselves to be caught with the Hand. The well-known
<i>American</i> Root <i>Cassavi</i> serves them for Bread, being bak’d in round Cakes
on hot Stones: of the Cakes they also make the Liquor <i>Perrinoe</i>, which tastes almost
like stale Beer, and is prepar’d by old Women and little Children, which
chew the <i>Cassavi</i>, and spit the same into a Pot full of Water, which having stood
a while, they strain the same through a Cloth, and set it a working with Potato-Roots.</p>

<p class='c010'>They are troubled with no Vermine, not so much as the little Fleas <i>Niquas</i>,
by the <i>Spaniards</i> call’d <i>Chigos</i>, which creep in between the Nails.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sheep and Oxen will not thrive here, but Swine would thrive exceedingly, if
their Dugs were not bit off in the Night by the Bats.</p>

<p class='c010'>The River <i>Wiapoco</i> hath many dangerous Water-falls, the one much higher than
the other; a little way beyond the first of them the Stream <i>Army</i> falls into <i>Wiapoco</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Marashewaccas</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Three days Journey Westerly dwell the <i>Marashewaccas</i>, whose Ears hang down
on their Shoulders; they worship for their Deity, an Image representing a Man,
who sitting flat on the Ground, with his Legs stretch’d out, leans with his Elbows
on his Knees, and holding up his Hands, gapes and stares up towards Heaven.</p>

<p class='c010'>North-West from <i>Wiapoco</i> rises the Mountain <i>Gomeribo</i>, which produces <i>Maiz</i>,
Tobacco, Cotton-Trees, and Vines.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the same place the Creek <i>Wainary</i> runs Westwardly with fresh Water a days
Journey into the Countrey; and from the said Creek a high Mountain, fit for the
production of Sugar and Tobacco, extends it self to the River <i>Apurwaca</i>, where the
<i>Wiopocaries</i> inhabit a great Tract of Land.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Harrithiahans</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>North-West from <i>Wiapoco</i> flows the River <i>Aperwacque</i>, whose mountainous Shores
bear <i>Brasile</i> Wood and wild Cinamon. The Stream it self takes its original out of
a large Lake, in the middle whereof lies a three-corner’d Isle. South-East from the
Lake dwell the <i>Harrithiahans</i>, beyond whose Countrey are the Rivers <i>Cauwo</i>, <i>Wia</i>, and
<i>Cajani</i>. On the Banks of the first dwelt, <i>Anno 1596.</i> according to the Relation of
<i>Laurence Keymis</i>, a People call’d <i>Jaos</i>, driven by the <i>Spaniards</i> from <i>Moruga</i>, and who
formerly possess’d the greatest part of <i>Guiana</i>; they distinguish themselves from
other People, by pricking their Faces full of Holes with the Tooth of a Beast not
unlike a Rat: But at present, the <i>Jaos</i> being departed from hence, the Countrey
lies desolate.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Wia</i>, which springs a great way up in the Countrey, hath a wide Mouth,
and near several Islands convenient Harbors: The biggest of the Isles, inhabited by
the <i>Shebaios</i>, is full of Provisions, <i>viz.</i> Fowl, Fish, excellent Fruit, wild Hogs, and
other Beasts.</p>

<p class='c010'>The triangular Isles, lying more Westerly, are also very fruitful, but not comparable
to <i>Gowatery</i>. So far as the Coast extends it self with high Mountains, it is
overgrown with <i>Brasile</i> Wood, but the lower Grounds produce Cotton, Pepper,
Silk, Balsam, and the Root <i>Wiapassa</i>, tasting like Ginger, and exceeding good against
a Lask, or the Head-ache.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_611'>611</span>Before the Mouth of <i>Cajani</i> appears the high Island <i>Mattoory</i>, surrounded by the

<p class='c010'>Between the Rivers <i>Cajani</i> and <i>Maccaria</i>, lies the low Island <i>Muccumbro</i>, out of
whose Center rise two Mountains, and which is inhabited, as the Main Coast by
<i>Caribbeeans</i>, whose General <i>Arrawicary</i> shew’d great friendship to the <i>Netherlanders</i>:
They observe no certain Laws for Government; Adultery and Murder they punish
with Death; they are very tyrannical towards their Wives, who for the least act
of incivility have their Brains beat out; they esteem one another according to the
number of their Wives, the eldest of which performs all Houshold-Offices.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Caribbeeans</i> the Inhabitants of <i>Guiana</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Caribbeeans</i> are accounted to have been the first Inhabitants of this Countrey,
for the <i>Jaos</i>, <i>Sappaios</i>, <i>Arowaccas</i>, and <i>Paragotos</i>, were driven hither by the <i>Spaniards</i>
from <i>Trinidad</i> or <i>Oronoque</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The wild <i>Caribbeeans</i> live farther up into the Countrey, and often fall with great
rage upon the other; but since the <i>Netherlanders</i> have furnish’d them with Arms,
they have not been so much molested by them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rivers.</div>

<p class='c010'>Beyond <i>Macavia</i> lies the River <i>Caurora</i>, which is very narrow and deep; and next
in order the Rivers <i>Manamonary</i>, <i>Sinamary</i>, <i>Cunanama</i>, <i>Juraca</i>, <i>Mawary</i>, <i>Amana</i>, and <i>Marawyny</i>,
full of Isles, and four Leagues broad at the Mouth; along the Shore grow
little Trees, whose Leaves wither as soon as touch’d by Mankind, but revives
again within half an hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next follow the Rivers <i>Sorrenam</i>, <i>Sorrenamme</i>, <i>Copanama</i>, <i>Marateca</i>, and <i>Curetiny</i>,
where the <i>Netherlanders</i>, by virtue of a Patent granted by the <i>States General</i>, drove a
Trade for several years.</p>

<p class='c010'>Somewhat farther the <i>Berbice</i>, <i>Apari</i>, <i>Maycawini</i>, <i>Mabeyca</i>, <i>Mirara</i> and <i>Essekebe</i>, discharge
their Waters into the Ocean, twenty days Journey from their Spring-Head,
where a great Lake (by the <i>Jaos</i> call’d <i>The Roponowini</i>, and by the <i>Caribbeeans</i>, <i>Parime</i>)
spreads it self a great way; and on its Northern Shore hath the Town <i>Manoa</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Along the River <i>Essebeke</i> is an excellent sort of Wood, the Dye call’d <i>Orellano</i>, and
abundance of <i>Cassavi</i>: In the Mouth of the River also lies the Isle <i>Ottoma</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, between <i>Essebeke</i> and the great River <i>Orinoque</i>, glide the lesser Streams
<i>Iwapoi</i>, <i>Pauroma</i>, <i>Gayni</i>, <i>Moruga</i>, <i>Ammacoura</i>, and <i>Parima</i>, before which lie several
nameless Isles.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Diego de Ordas</i> his Expedition.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Christopher Columbus</i>, in his third Voyage to the <i>West-Indies</i>, discover’d the great
Island <i>Trinidad</i>, where before the Mouth of the Bay <i>Vallena</i> he was in great danger,
as also the Ship Commanded by <i>Alonso de Ojeda</i>, by reason of the Waves, with which
the great River <i>Yuyapar</i>, otherwise call’d <i>Orinoque</i>, coming out of the High-lands of
<i>Paria</i>, falls into the Sea, which made him call the said Mouth <i>Bocca del Drago</i>; so
that <i>Columbus</i>, Anno 1599. discover’d the Main Coast of <i>America</i> to the Northward
of <i>Guiana</i>, as far as the Promontory <i>De la Vela</i>, before <i>Americus Vesputius</i>; whither
<i>Diego de Ordas</i> Steer’d with three Ships, Mann’d with four hundred <i>Castilians</i>, in the
Year 1531.<a id='t611'></a> and before <i>Guiana</i> took four <i>Caribbeeans</i> Prisoners in a <i>Canoo</i>, and finding
an <i>Emerauld</i> about them as big as a Man’s Hand, they inform’d him, that up the
River was a Rock all of such Stones, and a Mountain on which grew high Trees,
yielding store of Myrrh; but the strong contrary Tides and Water-falls prevented
<i>Ordas</i> from going thither; and being troubled at the loss of one of his Ships, he
ran along the Shore to <i>Paria</i>, and took the Fort which <i>Antonio Sedenno</i>, Governor of
<i>Trinidad</i>, had cast up there, and left the Command thereof to <i>Juan Gonsalvez</i>,
<i>Ordas</i> pretending that <i>Sedenno</i> had built it contrary to the Emperor’s Order, and that
he had made Slaves of the Natives. <i>Martin Jannez Tafur</i> stay’d in the conquer’d
Fort according to <i>Ordas</i> his appointment, who went up the River <i>Orinoque</i> not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_612'>612</span>without great hardship; for his Provisions were not onely short, but he was tormented
in the Day by the <i>Muschitoes</i>, and in the Night by the Bats; at last coming
to a Village Commanded by <i>Viapari</i>, he was kindly Entertain’d, which made <i>Ordas</i>
contrary to the will of his Men, who would willingly have gone farther into the
Countrey, stay there all the Winter; but as soon as the rainy Moneths were over,
<i>Ordas</i> went farther up the River <i>Orinoque</i>, where his Ship was stav’d against a sandy
Shelf, which forc’d him with two hundred Foot and forty Horse, to travel along
the Shore, where he was much scanted of Provisions, and for forty days together
met none but a few poor wild Fishermen, and at last stopt at an unknown River,
which fell into the <i>Orinoque</i>. The <i>Guianian</i> Guide which <i>Viapari</i> had given <i>Ordas</i>,
advis’d him to go along the Shore of the new River; because it would lead them to
a well Cloth’d and rich People: But <i>Ordas</i> went along by the River <i>Oronoque</i> till
he came where the Water falling from the Mountains makes it so terrible rough,
that <i>Ordas</i> his Vessels, which were Toed along, were not able to be got any farther,
so that after two hundred Leagues advance, he was necessitated, by reason of the
fore-mention’d Water-falls, to go aboard and Sail down the Stream: His Men being
weary’d with so troublesom a Journey, forsook him on the Island <i>Cubagua</i>,
which made him return over <i>Hispaniola</i> to <i>Spain</i>, where not long after he dy’d with
Grief.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Expedition of <i>Hieronimo Ortall</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>This unsuccessful Expedition of <i>Ordas</i> no way daunted <i>Hieronimo Ortall</i> from prosecuting
the same Design; for setting Sail from <i>St. Lucas</i>, Anno 1533. to the Fort
which <i>Ordas</i> had taken from <i>Juan Gonsalves</i>, he Steer’d from thence over to <i>Cubagua</i>,
to fetch some Men, and sent the Lieutenant <i>Alonso Herrera</i> with five Ketches, carrying
two hundred Men, the same way which <i>Ordas</i> had been. <i>Herrera</i> coming to the
fore-mention’d Water-falls where <i>Ordas</i> return’d, caus’d his Vessels to be unladen,
then Toed them by meer force over the Water-falls, where he discover’d plain
Fields without any Inhabitants, extending themselves to the Mouth of the River
<i>Meta</i>, where he quitted his Vessels, and with no small trouble got over Morasses
and Pools to the fruitful Countrey of the <i>Xaguas</i>, a People both cruel and valiant;
whom after a sharp Conflict vanquishing, he became Master of their Village, in
which he found plenty of Provisions, as also in another neighboring Town, where
his tir’d, and almost starv’d Army began to take Breath, being exceedingly refresh’d
with the delicious Meat of a sort of wild Dogs, which were here in great
abundance. Having spent the Winter Season here, they were often set upon by
the  <i>Caribbeeans</i>, by whose poyson’d Arrows several of them being shot, dy’d Distracted,
and amongst the rest <i>Herrera</i> himself; after which his Successor <i>Alvaro Ordas</i>
return’d to the Vessels, which were left at the Mouth of the River <i>Meta</i>, from
whence he Sail’d back without any other success, the Design being to find out the
Golden City <i>Manoa</i>, on the Banks of the great Lake <i>Parime</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Is follow’d by <i>Hermandes</i> and others.</div>

<p class='c010'>Not long after <i>Peter Hermandez de Serpa</i> undertook the same Work with three
hundred <i>Spaniards</i>, several <i>Brasilians</i> and <i>Negro</i>’s; but before he could reach the River
<i>Orinoque</i>, he was destroy’d by the salvage People <i>Wikiri</i>, eighteen of his Men
onely escaping to bring the news of this sad Disaster.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter de Orsua</i> following the footsteps of <i>Gonsalvo Pizarro</i>, went to seek for Gold
in <i>Guiana</i>; but being kill’d by <i>Lopes Agira</i> near the <i>Amazone</i> River, that Expedition
also prov’d fruitless.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Berreo</i>’s Relation of his Adventures to Sir <i>Walter Raleigh</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>With the same desire of finding Gold in <i>Guiana</i>, <i>Antonio Berreo</i> went from <i>New
Granada</i> thither; but being taken by Sir <i>Walter Raleigh</i>, was interrupted in his Design;
however, he gave him an Account of his Adventures, so far as he had gone, <i>viz.</i>
That he went to find out a Way along the River <i>Cassanor</i>, between <i>New Granada</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_613'>613</span>and <i>New Guiana</i>, went from <i>Cassanor</i> to the Stream <i>Meta</i>, and from thence to <i>Orinoque</i>,
where he was in great danger, by reason of sharp Rocks, over which the
Stream flowing, washes several Isles; That he spent a whole year before he came
to the utmost Borders of <i>Amapaia</i>; near which he lost several of his Barques, and
on the Shore, not onely divers Horses, but also many of his Men, who either dy’d
of hardship, or were kill’d by the Natives with poysonous Arrows, so that sixty
of his Men were kill’d in the Countrey of <i>Amapaia</i>, which extends along the River
Orinoque, besides a great many that dy’d there by drinking the Water, which was full
of poysonous Animals, and glided over a slimy and muddy Ground, which made it
thick and troubled: Six Moneths he stay’d in the Countrey <i>Amapaia</i>, where he
made Peace with the Inhabitants of <i>Anebas</i>, who gave him ten curious Images of
massie Gold. The River <i>Orinoque</i> is about four Leagues broad here, and about
seven hundred Miles long, before it fall into the Ocean, and is every where enrich’d
with the Waters of many Rivers which fall into it from the North and
South: He added moreover, that he endeavor’d to go down Southerly to <i>Guiana</i>,
but was prevented by steep Mountains, and therefore went on Easterly till he
came to the Countrey <i>Emeria</i>, where he found a courteous People, and plenty of
Provisions; that the Governor of <i>Caripana</i>, being about a hundred years of age,
had a long time Convers’d with the <i>Christians</i> on the Islands <i>Trinidad</i> and <i>Margareta</i>,
and learn’d a Form of Civil Government; that Sailing down the River <i>Orinoque</i>
between many Isles lying at the Mouth of the River to <i>Trinidad</i>, and from thence
to <i>Margareta</i>, he took sixty Men into his Service; but that he himself, being tir’d
with so great a Journey, and staying to refresh himself at <i>Trinidad</i>, fell into the
hands of another Party of the <i>English</i>; that before he was taken he sent several of
his Men to <i>Caripana</i>, to find the King of <i>Morequito</i>, who three years before had been
with abundance of Gold at <i>Cumana</i> and <i>Margareta</i>, and inform’d a <i>Spaniard</i> call’d
<i>Vides</i> so much concerning the Golden Countrey <i>Guiana</i>, that he obtain’d a Patent at
the <i>Spanish</i> Court to discover <i>Guiana</i>; but that <i>Vides</i>, jealous that he might be there
before him, had not onely incens’d <i>Morequito</i> against him, but so instructed him,
that he suffer’d his Men to pass through the Countrey to fetch Gold from the City
<i>Manoa</i>, and as they return’d, set upon them and slew them on the Borders of <i>Aromaia</i>,
together with a Monk that was in their Company, one Man onely escaping;
by whom being inform’d of the Murder, he immediately sent divers Soldiers to
take Revenge of <i>Morequito</i>, who flying to the Governor <i>Vides</i>, was nevertheless, upon
his demanding him in the King’s Name, deliver’d to him; and notwithstanding
he proffer’d a great Sum of Money for his Ransom, was cruelly put to Death;
but not satisfi’d with that Revenge, he over-run all the Countrey of <i>Aromaia</i>, took
<i>Morequito</i>’s Uncle, call’d <i>Topiawari</i>, Prisoner, who bought his Life for a hundred
Plates of Gold, and some Precious Stones; That Listing many Men in <i>Spain</i> for
the Gold which he sent thither, he Row’d with Barques up the Rivers <i>Barema</i>, <i>Pattroma</i>,
and <i>Dessequebe</i>, where he barter’d Trifles for Men, Women, and Children,
of whom he made great Sums of Money on the Island <i>Margareta</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Information which Sir <i>Walter Raleigh</i> got from his Prisoner <i>Berreo</i>, made
him desirous to make an Expedition to <i>Guiana</i>; to which purpose he sent Captain
<i>George Gifford</i> with a Ketch and a Barque to the River <i>Capuri</i>, where the Water fell
before the Vessels could get beyond the Sands in the Mouth of the River.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>John Donglas</i> had better success, being likewise sent out by Sir <i>Walter Raleigh</i>, for
he with his Boats found that <i>Orinoque</i> had nine Arms to the North Sea, and seven
to the South, which embrace divers Isles, of which those on the right side are call’d
<i>Pallamos</i>, and those on the left, <i>Horotomaca</i>. The Mouth of the River gapes a hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_614'>614</span>Leagues. On the fore-mention’d Isles dwell the <i>Titiriras</i>, a modest People,
who speak a bald Language; in the Summer they live under the open Skie upon
the bare Earth, and in the Winter (being there between <i>May</i> and <i>September</i>) on the
tops of the Trees, because during that time the River <i>Orinoque</i> rising thirty Foot
higher, overflows all the Isles thereabouts, which are very high and mountainous.
But <i>Raleigh</i> himself Rowing up the River <i>Amana</i>, endur’d great hardship, his Men
being most of them sweltred with the Heat, and great want of Provisions; and had
not their <i>Indian</i> Pilot shew’d them another Stream much easier to Navigate, he
would have been forc’d to return successless; but being stor’d with Provision out of
a Village built along the Shore, he chased four <i>Canoos</i>, of which he took one, and
also an <i>Atwaccas</i>, which in fifteen days time brought him into the River <i>Orinoque</i>,
where he saw the high Mountains of <i>Guiana</i>; afterwards Anchoring before a fair
sandy Bank, which lay near the Mouth of three Rivers, he took abundance of
Tortoises, and was furnish’d with plenty of all sorts of Provisions, sent him from
the Governor <i>Toparimaca</i>, who inhabited the pleasant Village <i>Arowocay</i>, built on a
little Hill, surrounded with delightful Gardens, and Fields till’d by the <i>Negro</i>’s;
who accommodating <i>Raleigh</i> with an experienc’d Pilot, he set Sail with a fresh
Easterly Wind, and Westward saw the Isles <i>Assapana</i>, twenty five Leagues long, and
six broad, and <i>Iwana</i>, of the same bigness. The River <i>Orinoque</i> hath here thirty
Leagues in breadth, and receives the Rivers <i>Arrawopana</i> and <i>Europa</i>: He Sail’d next
by the Isles <i>Ocaywita</i> and <i>Putayma</i>, opposite to which on the Main Land appears the
Mountain <i>Oecope</i>, whose top reacheth the Clouds; on the right side a Plain Countrey
discover’d it self a vast way, which the Pilot said was call’d <i>The Plain of Sayma</i>,
extending Northerly a hundred and twenty Leagues to <i>Cumana</i> and <i>Caracas</i>, inhabited
by four sorts of People, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Saymas</i>, <i>Assaways</i>, <i>Wikeries</i> and <i>Aroras</i>; which
last, being a Coal-black People, us’d poyson’d Arrows. <i>Raleigh</i> passing between
the two Mountains <i>Aroami</i> and <i>Aio</i>, came to an Anchor near the Island <i>Murscolima</i>,
and from thence into the Haven <i>Morequito</i>, where the King <i>Topiawari</i>, a hundred and
ten years of age, brought all sorts of Fruit, Poultrey, Fish and Flesh, and gave him an
Account of the Condition of <i>Guiana</i>, <i>viz.</i> That the whole Countrey from the Mountains
<i>Waccarima</i> to <i>Emeria</i>, bore the Name of <i>Guiana</i>, the Inhabitants calling themselves
<i>Orinoque Poni</i>; on the other side of the said Mountains lies the spacious Valley
<i>Amariocapana</i>, where the <i>Guianiatas</i> reside. Southerly the <i>Oreiones</i> and <i>Epuremei</i>, who
coming out of a strange Countrey, have destroy’d the ancient Inhabitants, leaving
onely the <i>Awaawaqueri</i> and <i>Cassipagoios</i>. The <i>Epuremei</i> built the stately City <i>Macurewarai</i>
there. But <i>Raleigh</i> going on his Journey saw the Island <i>Caiama</i>, and came
to the Mouth of the River <i>Caroli</i>, whose strong Current he was not able to stem,
wherefore he desir’d Aid from <i>Wanuretona</i>, Governor of <i>Canuria</i>, who furnish’d him
with Provisions, and Men to Toe him up the fore-mention’d Stream; and inform’d
him that the River <i>Caroli</i>, which sprung out of the Lake <i>Cassipa</i>, was inhabited on
one side by the <i>Iwarawakeri</i>, and the Lake <i>Cassipa</i> by three powerful People, <i>viz.</i> the
<i>Cassiapagotos</i>, <i>Eparagotos</i> and <i>Arawogotos</i>, all mortal Enemies to the <i>Spaniards</i>: whereupon
<i>Raleigh</i> sent some of his Men thither, who return’d with great hopes of finding
rich Gold-Mines. The fore-mention’d Lake also produces the Rivers <i>Aroi</i>,
<i>Atoica</i>, and <i>Caora</i>, near which dwell the <i>Ewaipanoma</i>, who have neither Necks nor
Chins, but their Mouthes just upon their Shoulders. Towards the North the River
<i>Cari</i> falls into the <i>Orinoque</i>, and on the West the Stream <i>Limo</i>; between both
which the <i>Cannibals</i> reside, whose Metropolis call’d <i>Acamacari</i> is very famous for
their strange way of Trading; for there the Women are brought to Market, and
bought by the <i>Arwaccas</i>: But because great Showers of Rain fell daily, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_615'>615</span>Stream <i>Caroli</i> glided downwards with extraordinary force, <i>Raleigh</i> return’d to <i>Morequito</i>;
from whence <i>Putima</i>, King of <i>Warapana</i>, conduced him to a rich Golden
Mountain in his Countrey, and along the Rivers <i>Mana</i>, <i>Oiana</i>, and <i>Cumaca</i>, to the
place where the <i>Orinoque</i> divides it self into three excellent Streams, the chiefest
whereof, call’d <i>Cararoopana</i>, washes the Province <i>Emeria</i>, out of whose Mountains
the Rivers <i>Waracayari</i>, <i>Coirama</i>, <i>Akaniri</i>, and <i>Iparoma</i>, glide to the Northern Ocean;
as also the <i>Araturi</i>, <i>Amacura</i>, <i>Barima</i>, <i>Wana</i>, <i>Morooca</i>, <i>Paroma</i>, and <i>Wyni</i>, all Branches of
the River <i>Orinoque</i>: From whence <i>Raleigh</i> return’d home to <i>England</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not long after he sent <i>Laurence Keymes</i> and <i>Thomas Masham</i> back to <i>Guiana</i>:
<i>Keymes</i> found out all the Rivers between the <i>Amazones</i> and the <i>Orinoque</i>, and <i>Masham</i>
the Stream <i>Wiapoco</i>; from whence both return’d without any farther success.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sir <i>Walter Raleigh</i> condemn’d for Treason.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>He is Repriev’d and sent again to <i>Guiana</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Raleigh</i> upon <i>Gundamor</i>’s Accusation Beheaded.</div>

<p class='c010'>After this the Business lay still for a while, in regard Sir <i>Walter Raleigh</i> being (together
with <i>Grey</i>, <i>Cobham</i>, and the <i>Romish</i> Priests, <i>Watson</i> and <i>Clark</i>) found guilty of
High Treason, was Condemn’d to die; but being Repriev’d by the King, was kept a
Prisoner in the <i>Tower</i> for the space of fourteen years; during which time he wrote a
Description of <i>Guiana</i>; which the King perusing, was so well pleas’d with it, especially
since he undertook to make out by several Reasons, that <i>England</i> might make
it self Master of divers Gold-Mines there, to which <i>Spain</i> could lay no manner of
Claim, that he discharg’d him out of Prison, and permitted him to make a second
Expedition: Whereupon with ten Ships, <i>Anno 1617.</i> he set Sail for <i>Guiana</i> again;
being toss’d with divers Storms, he at last came with five Sail to the River <i>Calliana</i>,
where he fell dangerously sick, and therefore sent Captain <i>Keymes</i> with five Sail to
the River <i>Orinoque</i>, to conduct the Men to the Gold-Mines; each Ship carrying
fifty Men, and the other Captains being <i>Parker</i>, <i>North</i>, <i>Thornap</i>, and Sir <i>Walter Raleigh</i>’s
Son. The <i>Spaniards</i> having a Garrison at <i>Orinoque</i>, fir’d very fiercely at the
<i>English</i>, who suffer’d great damage, and amongst divers others, Captain <i>Raleigh</i> himself
was slain, whilest the other five Sail lay near the Island <i>Trinidad</i>, under <i>John
Pennington</i>’s Command, who daily fear’d the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet. But <i>Keymes</i> found it
very difficult to Land in <i>Orinoque</i>, by reason of the Banks along the Shore, which
<i>Diego de Palameque</i> from <i>Puerto Rico</i> kept strongly guarded; therefore going to an
even Shore with intention to Land, he was so sharply receiv’d by a Body of <i>Spanish</i>
Musquetteers, that divers of his Men were mortally wounded; yet breaking in
amongst them, he went towards the Gold-Mines, to which the Way led through a
Wood where the <i>Spaniards</i> lay in Ambuscade; but he judg’d himself too weak to
do any good upon the Mines, one of which belong’d to <i>Peter Rodrigo de Parama</i>, a
second to <i>Herviano Frontino</i>, and the third to <i>Francisco Fashardo</i>: The <i>English</i> also
were fearful, by reason of the <i>Spaniards</i> Cruelties, who not long before had flay’d
several Merchants alive; so that <i>Keymes</i> contented himself with pillaging and burning
the Town <i>St. Thomas</i>, which the <i>Spaniards</i> had deserted. Soon after which
Captain <i>Whitby</i> ran away with a Ship from the Fleet, whilest <i>Keymes</i> return’d back
to <i>Raleigh</i>, who laid several things to his Charge concerning the unnecessary Expence
and shame of such an unsuccessful Voyage; which so wrought upon <i>Keymes</i>,
that he offer’d to lay violent hands on himself in his Cabbin. At length <i>Raleigh</i>
returning to <i>London</i>, was accus’d by the <i>Spanish</i> Ambassador <i>Gundamor</i> for the burning
<i>St. Thomas</i>, urging that his Master resented it so ill, that he threatned to wage a
War with  <i>England</i> if <i>Raleigh</i> was not Executed; who notwithstanding he alledg’d,
That the <i>Spaniards</i> shew’d the first Acts of Hostility against the <i>English</i>, who onely
defended themselves; and that <i>St. Thomas</i> was burnt without his knowledge or
Order; and that <i>Keymes</i> had not observ’d his Command in the discovering of the
Gold-Mines, (which Apologies were generally look’d upon as real Truths) yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_616'>616</span>the King esteeming the Peace with <i>Spain</i> of more value than one Man’s Life,
without taking notice of <i>Gundemor</i>’s Accusations, commanded that the Sentence
formerly pass’d on him for Treason should be Executed, and accordingly in the sixtieth
year of his Age he was Beheaded, discovering himself, by his Christian Behavior
and Profession at his Death, to be a far other kind of Person than what the
World had censur’d him to be.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since this last Expedition of Sir <i>Walter Raleigh</i>, we find not that there hath been
any great Resort or Trade unto this Countrey, except by a few <i>Netherland</i> Merchants,
who have yearly sent eight or nine Ships to the River <i>Orinoque</i> for Tobacco.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The temperature of the Air.</div>

<p class='c010'>As for the Air or Climate of <i>Guiana</i>, it is very differing, for about the <i>Amazone</i>
River, dry Weather begins about <i>August</i>, and the windy and rainy Season about
<i>February</i>; but Westward towards <i>Orinoque</i>, the Summer takes beginning in <i>October</i>,
and the Winter in <i>April</i>; the Days and Nights are almost of an equal length, and
the difference of Heat and Cold is but little.</p>

<p class='c010'>Burning-Feavers, Dropsie, and the <i>Jawnes</i>, destroy many People here; which last
is not unlike the <i>POX</i>, and proceeds from carnal Copulation with the <i>Guianian</i>
Women, who are naturally subject to this Disease.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Nature of the Inhabitants.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Inhabitants are divided into several sorts, the chiefest whereof being the
<i>Caribbees</i> go naked, covering onely their Privities with a Lappet. The Women,
though yellow, are very comely; and both Men and Women paint their Bodies
with <i>Netto</i>, which grows on little Trees in Cods: They make Holes through their
Noses, Lips and Ears, and hang Glass, Bells, pieces of Copper, or any other Trifles
that they get from the <i>English</i> and <i>Netherlanders</i>, in them: About their Necks, Arms
and Legs, they wear Strings of Beads, or Cockle-shells.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Houses with low Roofs, serve them onely to sleep in the Night upon
Cotton Hammocks, for in the day-time they sit under high Arch’d open places, that
the Wind may blow full upon them. Their Houshold-stuff consists of Earthen
Pots and Dishes neatly painted. They live in Tribes or Families together in a
Town, which is Govern’d by the eldest of them; and their <i>Militia</i> is Commanded
by one that is able to endure most Stripes with Switches without any shew of pain.
The chiefest of their Families have commonly three or four Wives, whereas others
are contented with one. The Men seldom do any toilsom Work, but make their
Wives do all, insomuch that as soon as a Woman is Deliver’d of a Child, she must
immediately go about her usual Employment, whilest her Husband lies lozelling
out his Moneth on a Hammock.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Language sounds not unpleasantly, but is hard to learn, because many
words differ but little in the pronunciation, and yet have quite another signification.</p>

<p class='c010'>When they march into the Field against their Enemies, then the General sends
a Stick to all the Villages under his Jurisdiction, on which are cut so many
Notches as there are Days appointed before he intends to set forth, which they cut
out again as the Days expire, and on the last they repair to the appointed place.</p>

<p class='c010'>A not much unlike Custom they observe in all Promises and Bargains; for they
give one another as many Sticks as they desire Days to perform the same in, and
so throw away every day one, till they have onely one remaining, and then they
begin to think of performing their Promise or Bargain.</p>

<p class='c010'>They know no word whereby to express any greater number than Ten;
Twenty they express by laying their ten Fingers on their Toes, and all that exceeds
Twenty, they compare to the Hairs of their Head, crying <i>Ounsa awara</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_617'>617</span>Some of the painted <i>Canoos</i> made of the Trunks of Trees, will carry five or six
Tuns.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their manner of Fighting, Religion, <i>&amp;c.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>In their Wars they use Bowes, poyson’d Arrows, short Truncheons of speckled
Wood, and Shields full of carv’d Images, and Fight without any Order. They go
upon no Design but in the Night, and upon certain advantages. All Women and
Children which they take Prisoners, are sold for Slaves, but the Men are cruelly
put to death.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is but little of Religion that can be ascrib’d to these People, onely that
some shew Reverence to the Sun and Moon, which they believe are both living
Creatures; but they make no Offerings to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Funeral-Feasts for great Persons are strangely kept, <i>viz.</i> all the Men making
themselves Drunk with the Liquor <i>Parranoro</i>, Dance three or four days one
after another, and he that drinks most, and is worst Drunk, gains the greatest Honor,
whilest the Women lament and mourn for the Deceased.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Priests, call’d <i>Peeaios</i>, are in great esteem amongst them, because they pretend
that they Converse with the Spirits <i>Wattipa</i> and <i>Yarakin</i>, which the <i>Guianians</i> exceedingly
fear, apprehending themselves often beaten black and blue by them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Peeaios</i> also profess themselves to be Chirurgeons and Doctors, but if they
cure not their Patients, they go in danger of their Lives, unless they speedily get
away.</p>

<p class='c010'>They burn their dead Bodies, together with those things the Deceased affected
most in his Life-time. A Prince or Governor also hath his Slaves put to death
at the time when he is burn’d, that they may serve him in the other World.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Bread-Corn.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Cassavi</i>-Root press’d, boyl’d with Pepper, dry’d and bak’d on hot Stones,
serves the Natives for Bread.</p>

<p class='c010'>Each Grain that is Sown here produces in Harvest above fifteen hundred.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Corn makes wholsom and well tasted Beer, call’d <i>Passiaw</i>, and of their
stamp’d <i>Cassavi</i> they make the Liquor <i>Parranow</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In hollow Trees, and Caves under Ground, they find abundance of Honey; and
their Vines afford them excellent Grapes twice a year.</p>

<p class='c010'>No Plant is ever seen here without either Leaf, Blossom, or Fruit, except the
<i>European</i> Apple-Tree, which never changes its nature, but blossoms and bears Fruit
at the same time of the year as in <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The wild Hogs <i>Pokkiero</i>, whose Navels grow on their Backs; and the <i>Pangio</i>,
not unlike our Swine, afford the Inhabitants excellent Food.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here are also Water-hogs, of a very delicious taste; but because they are very
apprehensive, and dive at the least noise, they are seldom taken.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Woods are full of Baboons and Apes, as also the slothful Beast <i>Ai</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Hares here, being of a brown Colour, with white Specks, and the red Rabbets,
are accounted great Delicacies.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is no Countrey in <i>America</i>, which breeds greater <i>Armadillo</i>’s than <i>Guiana</i>,
some of them weighing eighty Pound.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here are also Bears, which live on nothing but Pismires; they have long hairy
Tails, with which they cover their Bodies in rainy Weather; they put their
Tongues a Foot deep into the Pismires Nests, and so pulls them out.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Tygers here are either black, spotted, or red; but the black exceed the other
in cruelty, yet are seldom seen near inhabited places; the spotted and red devour
abundance of Cattel, but will seldom set upon a Man, especially in the day-time.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Woods are also full of Land-Turtles, which the Inhabitants take, and keep
till they have occasion to make use of their Flesh.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_618'>618</span>The Eagles that are here with their Claws, Engage with those that go about to
take them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Catamountains make such an exceeding noise at a certain hour, both in
the Night and in the Day, that it is heard two Leagues off.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Marmozets</i>, a little Beast, biting the Catamountains and Apes in the Ears,
forces them to leap from one Tree to another.</p>

<p class='c010'>The black Beast <i>Quotto</i> hath a Face like an old Woman, and hanging by the
Tail, swings from one Tree to another.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Cuscary</i> is a brown four-footed Creature, about the bigness of a little Dog,
but hath the shape of a Lyon.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Birds.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, <i>Guiana</i> produces Teal, Geese, Crains, Phesants, Partridges, Pigeons,
Marlins, Snipes, Falcons, Plovers, and Parrots of all sorts, besides many other
strange Fowls; amongst which the chiefest are a sort whose Feathers glitter like
Scarlet, and walk along in Rank and Fyle like Soldiers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fish.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Sea produces abundance of Turbots, Soals, Thornback, yellow Salmon,
Sturgeon, Black-fish, Gurnets, Crabs, and Oysters.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amongst other Fishes, the <i>Cassoorwa</i>, which is somewhat bigger than an Eel, is
very strange, having two Sights in each Eye, of which it always holds one above,
and the other underneath the Water when it swims.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here are also the great Fishes call’d <i>Manati</i> and <i>Num-eel</i>, by which if any part of
a Man be touch’d, it immediately becomes stiff.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Vermin.</div>

<p class='c010'>There are likewise divers Vermine, which trouble the Countrey <i>Guiana</i>, among
which are Serpents, of thirty Foot long, that come out of the Water and feed on
the Land; they do little hurt, as not being poysonous: but there are many of a
lesser size, whose biting is so venomous, that it causes the Flesh of a Man to rot in
twenty four hours time: others there are which have forked Tails, and Tusks in
the Roof of their Mouthes.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Crocodiles here also devour abundance of Cattel.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange kind of Scorpions.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Scorpions, which are black, and resemble a Lobster, breed under dry
Wood or Corn; their Stings are hid in their Tails, with which if any one be
touch’d, he is sure to endure an intolerable pain, but without danger of losing his
Life for the present, yet nothing can perfectly cure the same, except the Scorpion
kill’d and laid on the Wound.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Bats here are as big as Pigeons, and they suck the Blood of Men and
Beasts so gently, that they seldom perceive the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Pismires also do great mischief, especially in sandy Grounds; and likewise
the <i>Musketo</i>’s, whose Stings cause painful Swellings; but these most of all trouble
them that inhabit near the Sea side on low Lands, insomuch that the Fisher-men
bury themselves in the Night in Sand, leaving onely Holes to breathe at.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frogs and Toads also make a terrible noise here, and especially after Rain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Commodities of the Countrey.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Soil is inferior to none in the World, for the production of Sugar; but the
general Commodities of the Countrey are Flax, Cotton, Hemp, the Berry <i>Annoto</i>,
which Dyes an excellent Orange colour, another Berry which Dyes a deep Blue,
a Tree whose Leaves Dye a Red, and the Wood of another Tree whose Juice Dyes
a Purple and Crimson.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, <i>Guiana</i> produces the Gums <i>Lemnia</i>, <i>Barattu</i>, and <i>Carriman</i>, which being
black and prickly, smells very pleasantly, and cures the Head-ache, Bruises,
Pains in the Limbs, Gouts, and green Wounds. The same operation hath the
Gum <i>Baratta</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here are also good <i>Sena</i>, <i>Bolus Armenius</i>, <i>Cassia-Fistula</i>, <i>Terra-Lemnia</i>, the Berry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_619'>619</span><i>Kelette</i>, very effectual against the Bloody-flux, the Juice of the Leaf <i>Upee</i>, which
cures the Wounds of poyson’d Arrows, and a sort of somniferous Apples, whereof
the least bite occasions a deadly Sleep.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is also a Tree, generally growing about the Houses of the Natives, the
Boughs whereof bruis’d between two Stones, and thrown into the Creeks of deep
Water full of Fish, cause them to swim above Water upon their Backs.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Letter</i>-Wood call’d <i>Pira timinere</i>, turns also to a good account, much more
the excellent Stones, Jasper and Porphyr.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nor are there wanting Gold and Silver-Mines, which doubtless would yield
great profit, were they open’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Grain of the Countrey grows on Stalks seven Foot long, on the tops whereof
hang two Ears full of Kernels as big as Pease, which ripens in four Moneths.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Sugar-Canes, being of the bigness of a Man’s Arm, and about six Foot
long, are at the years end cut off, broken and press’d in a Mill; after which the
Juice boyl’d in Copper Kettles to a certain Substance, is put into woodden Tunnels,
square at the top, and narrow at bottom, with a small Hole, which is open’d
as soon as the Sugar is sufficiently hardned, to let out the Syrrup; after which it
is put into Hogsheads, and so Transported.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Negro</i>’s which are brought from <i>Angola</i> and <i>Guinee</i>, are so cruelly us’d, that
they oftentimes through despair destroy themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>The whole Countrey of <i>Guiana</i> is by several modern Writers methodically divided
into these inferior or lesser Provinces, 1. <i>Rio de las Amazones.</i>  2. <i>Wiapoco</i>, or
<i>Guiana</i>, properly so call’d. 3. <i>Orenoque</i>; and 4. The Islands of <i>Guiana</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Rio de las Amazones.</i></div>

<p class='c010'><i>Rio de las Amazones</i>, or the Countrey of the <i>Amazones</i>, contains all that part of
<i>Guiana</i> which lieth on both sides of the River <i>Orellano</i>, of a rich and good Soil, generally,
abounding with all sorts of Fruits, and especially with those which the
<i>Americans</i> call <i>Totok</i>, and love it extreamly, out of an opinion, they say, that it excites
them to Venery, whereunto they are of themselves but too much inclin’d;
and another which they call <i>Pita</i>, of a taste far more delicious and pleasing, and
not so hurtful as the other. The Countrey was first discover’d by the fore-mention’d
<i>Francisco Orellana</i>, a <i>Spaniard</i> from <i>Quito</i>, but it was onely by the River <i>Orellana</i>; and
though he be credibly reported to have Sail’d no less than eighteen hundred
Leagues down the Stream, and to have discover’d a rich and fair Countrey on both
sides the River, well peopled with Natives, and giving in divers places no small
Arguments of greater Wealth and Riches more within Land; yet such was the bad
success of his second Endeavors, and likewise of those that follow’d him, as is evident
from what hath been before related, that, as yet, there seems no farther Report
to be given, at least not of any thing special, concerning that part of the
Countrey.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Wiapoco</i>, or <i>Guiana</i>, properly so call’d.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Wiapoco</i>, or <i>Guiana</i>, properly so call’d, taketh up the middle part of this Province,
being divided, as the other, almost into two equal parts, by the River <i>Wiapoco</i>,
which runs through the midst of it. The Countrey on both sides of the River is
very rich and fertile, and so naturally apt, both for Sugar-Canes, Cotton-Wooll,
and Tobacco, that they are said to grow here (all of them very good) without
Planting, or any art of Husbandry. In this Countrey likewise should be the famous
<i>Dorada</i>, as the <i>Spaniards</i> call it, or <i>City of Gold</i> (if it could be found) with the
reports and hopes whereof some of our own Nation seem to have been not a little
possess’d as well as the <i>Spaniards</i>: nor can we much blame them; for if the Stories of
it had prov’d true, it must have been one of the goodliest and fairest Cities in the
World (not to speak of the Wealth.) <i>Diego de Ordas</i>, the <i>Spaniard</i> of whom we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_620'>620</span>lately had occasion to make frequent mention of, being reported by some to have
travell’d one whole day, and half another in it, before he could arrive at the King’s
Palace; which yet must be suppos’d to have stood but in the midst of the City.
Places of less Magnificence, but more Certainty, are 1. <i>Caripo</i>, which was once a
Colony of <i>English</i>, setled there by Captain <i>Robert Harcourt</i>, Anno 1608. upon the
Banks of <i>Wiapoco</i>, and not far from the Mouth of it; being a place, by the advantage
of a Rock, which it hath on the one side of it, of great strength and very difficult
access; the Air about it sound, and said to be very agreeable to <i>English</i> Bodies.
2. <i>Gomaribo</i>, a Colony formerly of the <i>Dutch</i>, on the North-West side of the Bay of
<i>Wiapoco</i>, but since deserted by them. 3. <i>Woyemon.</i> 4. <i>Crewinay</i>, both of them Towns
of the Natives, not far distant from the other.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Orinoque.</i></div>

<p class='c010'><i>Orinoque</i>, or the third Division of this Province, comprehendeth the most Northerly
parts of <i>Guiana</i>, lying upon, or towards the Banks of this famous River: a
Countrey likewise reported to be very rich, and comparable to <i>Peru</i> it self for hidden
Treasure, which, they say, is not yet discover’d, onely for want of diligent and
industrious searching. The Places in it already known are onely 1. <i>Coniolaba</i>, as
they call it, which seems to be some Town of the Natives, lying a few Leagues distant
from the <i>Orinoque</i>, towards the South. 2. <i>Morequito</i>, a known Port or Haven-Town
upon a Branch of the <i>Orinoque</i>, much frequented, and of great use to the <i>English</i>
when they discover’d these Coasts. 3. <i>Wenicapora</i>: and 4. <i>St Thomas</i>, the onely
Town which the <i>Spaniards</i> hold upon this part of the Continent, situate upon the
principal Channel of the <i>Orinoque</i>, and consisting of two hundred Families, or
thereabouts: It is now a fortifi’d Place, and was taken by Sir <i>Walter Raleigh</i>, in that
unfortunate Action of 1617. above related more at large.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Islands belonging to <i>Guiana</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Islands that belong to, and are commonly reckon’d as parts of <i>Guiana</i>, are
either such as lie scatter’d about the Shore of the Province, or such as are found at
the Mouth, and sometime far within the Channel of those great Rivers, which empty
themselves at several parts of this Countrey into the Sea, <i>viz.</i> <i>Orinoque</i>, <i>Wiapoco</i>,
<i>Rio de las Amazones</i>, &amp;c. There are many of them, but of any great name or esteem,
onely two, <i>viz.</i> <i>Trinidado</i> and <i>Tabago</i>, the Description whereof we shall here omit,
as having already taken notice of them amongst the <i>Sotaventi</i> and <i>Caribbee</i> Islands.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Situation and Description of <i>Nova Andalusia</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>VVestward of <i>Guiana</i> lieth the Countrey of <i>Paria</i>, so call’d from its chief
River: It hath also the Denomination of <i>New Andalusia</i>, but for
what resemblance with <i>Andalusia</i> of <i>Old Spain</i>, they do not tell us.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey lying as it doth, brings us back again by the Eastern Coast to
the <i>Isthmus</i> or <i>Strait</i>, which, as we have often said, joyns the two parts of the Continent
of <i>America</i> together, at least to those Countreys that lie next upon it to the
South, <i>viz.</i> the Kingdom of <i>Granada</i>, &amp;c. It hath on the East <i>Guiana</i>, and those
Islands which lie about the Mouth of <i>Orinoque</i>; on the West, the Gulf or Bay of
<i>Venezuela</i>, with some part of the new Kingdom abovesaid; on the North it is
wash’d with the <i>Atlantick</i> Ocean; and on the South hath some Countreys yet undiscover’d,
toward the <i>Andes</i>. The whole consisteth partly of Continent, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_621'>621</span>partly of Islands near adjoyning to it, and is commonly divided into five several
Precincts or Parts, which are 1. <i>Cumana.</i> 2: <i>Venezuela</i>, being upon the Continent,
3. <i>Margareta.</i> 4. <i>Cubagua</i>, two Islands above-mention’d, famous for Pearl-fishing;
and lastly, some lesser islands.</p>

<h4 id='c621' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. II.</span><br /> Cumana.</h4>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Bounds and Description of <i>Cumana</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'><i>Cumana</i> is bounded Eastward with the Gulf of <i>Paria</i> and the River <i>Orinoque</i>;
on the West, with <i>Venezuela</i>; Northward it hath the <i>Atlantick</i>; and on
the South, those undiscover’d Countreys above mention’d; extending along
the Northern Ocean, over against <i>Margareta</i> two hundred Leagues or more,
as some say, in length, and not much less than a hundred in breadth.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Coast of this Countrey, as well as of the Islands <i>Margareta</i> and <i>Cabagua</i>, hath
formerly been much fam’d for the rich Trade of Pearls and Pearl-fishing; which
failing, its principal esteem now is for an excellent Vein of Salt, which they dig
here as out of a Mine, and gather it naturally made ready to their Hands, not half
a Mile from the Sea side, on the back side of the Promontory or Cape, by some
call’d <i>Punto de Araya</i>, and by others for this reason <i>Cape de Salinas</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and Places of note.</div>

<p class='c010'>Places of chiefest consideration here, are 1. <i>Cumana</i> it self, a Colony of <i>Spaniards</i>
seated on the Banks of a little River two Miles distant from the Sea, where it hath
a good Harbor.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>St. Jago</i>, a very strong Fortress, which the <i>Spaniards</i> of late years have built,
for the defence and security of the Salt-works against the <i>Dutch</i>, who began to
Trade much that way, and in the Year 1622. had a Design to have made themselves
Masters of the Place.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>St. Michael de Neveri</i>, another Fortress of theirs, standing upon a River
bearing the same Name.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>Guaniba</i>, a Town of the Natives.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey of <i>Cumana</i>, being generally infested with terrible Crocodiles,
hath a large Inlet call’d <i>Cariaco</i>, which flows fourteen Leagues into the Countrey.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Manners and Customs of the People.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Men of this Countrey wear Cotton Cloaks, and anointing their Bodies
with Gum, stick the same full of Feathers.</p>

<p class='c010'>When they go to Wars, or to a general Feast, then they shave their Hair off above
their Ears, pull out their Beards, and black their Teeth with a certain Herb.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Princes and Grandees take as many Wives as they please, and give to those
of their Guests whom they intend most to oblige, their choice of the fairest of
them to lie with.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whoring is accounted no shame, except amongst Marry’d Women, who generally
live very Chaste, unless their Husbands consent to their Adultery.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Women also Hunt, Fish, Shoot, and Swim, and are diligent in Tilling
their Lands, and other Houshold Affairs. Most of them have sore Eyes, occasion’d
not so much (as some wrongfully suppose) by their drinking of the Water out of
the Stream <i>Cumana</i>, but proceeding rather from their unwholsom Food, as Spiders,
and the like.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amongst the several sorts of Trees that grow here, there are some that yield a
white well scented Gum, or delicious Juice like Milk, and produce a Fruit not unlike
a Mulberry, which may be boyl’d to an excellent Syrrup; the Wood also
strikes Fire: There are others, whose Timber is good for Shipping.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_622'>622</span>The Soil also produces <i>Cassia-Fistula</i>, Roses, and other strong smelling Flowers
and Herbs.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Beasts.</div>

<p class='c010'>For Beasts, besides Lyons, Tygers, and wild Hogs, there are several strange
kinds here, as the <i>Cappa</i>, which is bigger than an Ass, having shaggy and black
Hair; it runs away from Mankind, but devours whatsoever else it meets with.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Aranata</i>, which hath a Goats Beard, and is of the bigness of a Greyhound;
it howls very dreadfully, and feeds on Fruits.</p>

<p class='c010'>The wild Cats which breed here, leap, though great with Young, from one
Tree to another.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Evening a Beast like a lean Dog comes to their Huts, cries like a Child,
and devours all those it meets abroad; wherefore every one that goes out in the
Night carries a lighted Stick with him, for this Beast dreads the sight of Fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Trees give Harbor to great numbers of Parrots, and other fine Feather’d
Birds.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Bats here are very large and hurtful, sucking the Blood from Men and
Beasts.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Muschito</i>’s also do very much plague and vex the Inhabitants.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Dominicans</i> put to death by the Natives.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Alonzo de Ojeda</i> slain by <i>Gonzales</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Anno 1513.</i> two <i>Dominican</i> Fryers went over from <i>Terra Fiona</i> to <i>Cumana</i>, where
the Natives kindly Entertain’d them, till a <i>Spanish</i> Ship Anchoring there for the
Pearl-Trade, carry’d away by violence the Governor and seventeen of his Servants;
whereupon the Natives threatned, that unless their Lord was restor’d, they would
put the two <i>Dominicans</i> to death; the <i>Spaniards</i> promising restauration of him in four
Moneths time, inform’d the Council at <i>Hispaniola</i> of it, who not consenting to
his Releasement, the two Monks were, according the former threatning, presently
put to death. Yet after this the <i>Franciscans</i> and <i>Dominicans</i> built each of them a
Cloyster in the Province of <i>Chiribichi</i>, where they kept friendly Correspondence
with the <i>Cumana</i>’s, till <i>Anno 1520.</i> when <i>Alonso de Ojeda</i> coming to an Anchor before
<i>Maracapana</i>, under pretence of bartering <i>Maiz</i> for <i>Spanish</i> Goods with the <i>Tagarez</i>,
who came about fifty from the Mountains on which they liv’d, being three Leagues
up in the Countrey, and brought <i>Maiz</i> down to the Shore, the <i>Spaniards</i> took thirty
six of them Prisoners, and kill’d or wounded the rest: Whereupon the Governor
<i>Gonzales</i> being complain’d unto by the neighboring Prince <i>Maraguey</i>, and his
assistance desir’d in taking Revenge of the <i>Dominicans</i> and <i>Franciscans</i>, who had
urg’d and perswaded <i>Ojeda</i> to the fore-mention’d Act, <i>Gonzales</i> hereupon made an
Agreement with <i>Maraguey</i>, that he should destroy the Monks, whilest he himself
would kill <i>Ojeda</i>, which they accordingly perform’d. The Council in <i>St. Domingo</i>
inform’d hereof, immediately sent three Ships, Mann’d with three hundred Men,
under the Command of <i>Gonzalvo de Ocampo</i>, who Anchoring in the Haven of <i>Maracapana</i>,
feign’d as if he came newly from <i>Spain</i>, and that he knew nothing of
the Business between <i>Ojeda</i> and <i>Gonzales</i>, that so he might entice the Natives into
his Ship, and accordingly when divers of them came aboard, the Armed <i>Spaniards</i>
started from under the Decks, and hung them up at their Yard-arms, burnt the
Village <i>Maracapana</i>, and ruin’d the Countrey far and near with Fire and Sword.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Soto</i> with all his Men destroy’d by the <i>Indians</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Ocampo</i> also built the Town <i>Toledo</i>, about half a League farther into the Countrey,
where the Bishop <i>Bartholomew de las Casas</i>, making his Visitation, commanded
<i>Ocampo</i> to forbear his cruelty against the Natives, he having daily either burnt,
hang’d, beheaded, or made Slaves of some or other of them. <i>Casas</i> also caus’d a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_623'>623</span>little Fort to be built at the Mouth of the River <i>Cumana</i>, to be near to prevent the
inhumane Murders and Oppressions committed by his Countrey-men; but because
the Inhabitants of <i>Cubagua</i> bereav’d him of his chief Builder, his Fort was left
half unfinish’d; wherefore <i>Casas</i> leaving the Command of this Countrey to <i>Francisco
de Soto</i>, went back to <i>Hispaniola</i>, where in <i>St. Domingo</i> he made his Complaints
to the High Court of Justice of the <i>Spaniards</i> Cruelties; but being little regarded,
he went into the <i>Dominicans</i> Cloyster, till he was call’d out and made Bishop of
<i>Chiapa</i>. Mean while <i>Soto</i>, contrary to <i>Casas</i> his order, had fitted out two Ships to
Trade along the Coast of <i>Paria</i>; but the Expedition prov’d very unsuccessful, for
he and all his Men were destroy’d by the Natives; not without just reason, for the
<i>Spaniards</i> (according to the Relation of <i>Casas</i> from an Eye-witness) destroy’d this
Countrey after such a manner, that a Ship Sail’d between <i>Lucago</i> and <i>Hispaniola</i> sixty
Leagues without any Compass, finding the Way onely by the floating of dead
Bodies, thrown out of the <i>Spanish</i> Ships. Moreover, the Prisoners fainting, were
set ashore on <i>Hispaniola</i>, and divided into Companies, each Company consisting of
twenty; Parents separated from their Children, and Husbands from their Wives,
and Lots cast for them: those that had either sick, decrepid, or old People fall to
their share, us’d to cry (as <i>Casas</i> testifies he hath often heard,) <i>What do I do with this
sick, decrepid old Dog? give him to the Devil; I will not put my self to the trouble to kill and
bury him.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>But <i>Soto</i>’s Death was not left unreveng’d; for not long after <i>Jacob Castellon</i>
setting Sail from <i>St. Domingo</i>, left several Companies on <i>Cubagua</i>, to re-build the
Town <i>Cadiz</i>, and rais’d a Fort at the Mouth of <i>Cumana</i>, which hath ever since been
kept by the <i>Spaniards</i>, who made great slaughter amongst the Natives.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Hieronymo Ortall</i> deserted by his Men.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Hieronymo Ortall</i> Sailing up the Stream <i>Negeri</i>, sent his Lieutenant <i>Augustine Delgado</i>
through the populous Provinces <i>Guacharuco</i> and <i>Parimatuotu</i> to the River <i>Unare</i>,
where, not without a sharp Conflict, he took abundance of Provisions in a Village.
In the mean time <i>Ortall</i> travell’d to <i>Meta</i>, acting inhumane Cruelties all the way;
but approaching <i>Guiana</i> (where <i>Delgado</i> was kill’d) he was deserted by his mutinous
Men, who ran over to <i>Nicholas Federman</i>; so that he was forc’d to return back to the
new Fort <i>Miguel de Neveri</i>, and from thence to <i>St. Domingo</i> with ten Soldiers, fearing
that <i>Antonio Sedenno</i> (who judg’d himself wrong’d by <i>Ortall</i>, because <i>Cumana</i> belong’d
to his Lordship) would fall upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Sedenno</i> being five hundred Men strong discover’d the Sea-Coast all along to
<i>Patigutaro</i>; where Setling himself, he regarded no Discipline; which the Natives
observing, kill’d many a <i>Spaniard</i>, and others the Tygers also devour’d, especially
in the Night, they being forc’d to keep lighted Fires about them against the wild
Beasts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Death of <i>Sedenno</i> and <i>Juan Fernandez</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>About the beginning of the Year 1537. <i>Sedenno</i> travell’d to the Countrey <i>Anapuya</i>
and <i>Orocomay</i>, to the Province <i>Goioguaney</i>, where the Inhabitants defended themselves
very valiantly in a woodden Fort, before which many <i>Spaniards</i> were kill’d with
poyson’d Arrows, and those who were not mortally wounded, had no way to
escape but by burning the Poyson out with hot Irons; yet at last the Defendants
were forc’d to flie with their Wives and Children up to the Mountains, overgrown
with Brambles. <i>Sedenno</i> marching through barren Fields, and over troublesom Rivers,
came to the mountainous Countrey <i>Catapararo</i>, where he found abundance of
<i>Maiz</i>, and some little pieces of Gold, and was advanc’d about a League and a half
in <i>Cumana</i>, when dying, he made room for his Successor <i>Juan Fernandez</i>, who surviv’d
him not long; yet the Expedition was not left unprosecuted: for <i>Sedenno</i>’s
Men, after the Decease of him and <i>Fernandez</i>, went farther, and discover’d a low
<span class='pageno' id='Page_624'>624</span>Land, which in the Winter being overflow’d, forc’d the Inhabitants to remove to
the Mountains: But at last the <i>Spaniards</i>, being weary with travelling, fell out
amongst themselves, and dividing into several Parties, went several ways, some to
<i>Venezuela</i>, others to <i>Maracapana</i>, and the rest to <i>Cubagua</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and principal Places of <i>Venezuela</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The principal part of the Province of <i>Venezuela</i> is border’d on the East with
<i>Cumana</i>; on the West, with a great Gulf or Bay, call’d <i>The Bay of Venezuela</i>,
with the Lake <i>Maracabo</i>, and some part of <i>New Granada</i>; Northward it
hath the Ocean, or <i>Atlantick</i> Sea; Southward, some undiscover’d Countreys,
which, as we said, lie betwixt the <i>Andes</i> and it. It stretches out in length from East
to West, a hundred and thirty Leagues, or thereabouts, but in breadth little more
than half so much; it was nam’d <i>Venezuela</i>, or <i>Little Venice</i>, by <i>Alonso de Ojeda</i>, a <i>Spaniard</i>,
who at his first discovery of the Countrey fell upon a Town of the Natives,
which stood like another <i>Venice</i>, all upon the Water, and having no passage to it
but by Boats. It is a Countrey extraordinary rich in all sorts of Commodities, affords
good Pasture for Cattel, and abundance of fair Herds of them, Oxen, Sheep,
Swine, <i>&amp;c.</i> plenty of Corn, and other Grain, great store of Venison in the Woods,
of Fish in the Rivers, Gold in the Mines, and therefore not likely but to be well
peopled and inhabited, especially by the <i>Spaniards</i>, whose Towns and Places of
chief importance are these, 1. <i>Venezuela</i>, at the most Westerly Confines of the
Countrey, built upon the Sea, with the advantage of a double Haven, in a temperate
and good Air, and the Soil round about it the best in the whole Province: It
is now a Bishop’s See, who is Suffragan to the Arch-bishop in <i>Hispaniola</i>, and the
ordinary Residence of the Governor.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Caravalleda</i>, call’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>, <i>Nuestra Sennora de Caravalleda</i>, fourscore
Leagues distant from <i>Venezuela</i> towards the East, upon the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>St. Jago de Leon</i>, in the Countrey of <i>Caracas</i>, four or five Leagues Southward
of <i>Caravalleda</i>, and six or seven distant from the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <i>New Valentia</i>, twenty five Leagues distant from <i>St. Jago</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <i>New Xeres</i>, a Town but lately built, fifteen Leagues Southward of <i>New
Valentia</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <i>New Segovia</i>, but one League distant from <i>Xeres</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>7. <i>Tucuyo</i>, a Place well known and frequented, for the abundance of Sugar that
is made there, and in the Countrey round about it.</p>

<p class='c010'>8. <i>Truxillo</i>, or <i>Our Lady de la Paz</i>, eighteen Leagues Southward of the Lake <i>Maracabo</i>,
a Place of great resort, and much frequented for Trade both by <i>Spaniards</i>
and Natives.</p>

<p class='c010'>9. <i>Laguna</i>, a Town lying more towards the bottom of the Lake, said to be much
haunted with Tygers; and more than this, not much is said of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>According to the ancient Division of the Natives, this Province contains the
Countreys <i>Curiana</i>, <i>Cuycas</i>, <i>Caracas</i>, <i>Bariquicemeto</i>, <i>Tucuyo</i>, and <i>Carora</i>; in which there
are estimated to be about a hundred thousand Inhabitants that pay Taxes; which
Charge, according to a Law made at the <i>Spanish</i> Court, all Men above fifty, and
Youth under eighteen, are freed from: yet this Countrey had formerly much
more People, great numbers of them being destroy’d by the <i>Germans</i>, Anno 1529.
for the Bishop <i>Bartholomeus de las Casas</i> relates, That above fifty hundred thousand
of the Inhabitants were kill’d by them; nay, they rooted out whole Countreys,
notwithstanding the Natives were ready to Entertain them with all Civility imaginable;
the Particulars of the Story are as followeth:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Expedition of <i>Alfinger</i> and <i>Sayltar</i> to <i>Venezuela</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Alfinger</i>’s horrid Cruelties upon the Natives.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_625'>625</span>When the Emperor <i>Charles</i> the Fifth Marry’d with <i>Isabella</i>, Daughter to the King
of <i>Portugal</i>, Anno 1526. the <i>Welsares</i>, being <i>Dutch</i> Gentlemen in <i>Augsburgh</i>, made an
Agreement with him for a Sum of Money, to Conquer <i>Venezuela</i>; whither they
sent <i>Ambrosius Alfinger</i>, and <i>Bartholomeus Sayltar</i>, with four hundred Foot and eighty
Horse: These Forces Landing at <i>Venezuela</i>, drove away <i>Juan de Ampues</i>, who Sailing
from <i>St. Domingo</i> thither, had discover’d the Coast along <i>Coriano</i>, and already
made an Agreement with a mighty Prince of that Countrey, call’d <i>Manaure</i>. But
<i>Alfinger</i> marching to the Lake <i>Maracabo</i>, destroy’d all the Inhabitants of the Countrey
<i>Axaguas</i>, though they came to meet him Dancing, with rich Presents of Gold;
which he not regarding, kill’d them, drove some into a House, and there cut them
in pieces, and burnt those that were got upon the Roof. From hence going towards
the <i>Pocabuyes</i>, who dwelt on the West side of <i>Maracabo</i>, amongst high Mountains,
he was Entertain’d by them a considerable time very courteously, and Presented
with rich Gifts, for which at his departure he shut up both Men, Women, and
Children, into a high Wall’d Park, where they were all to perish, if they did not
every one pay a certain quantity of Gold to be releas’d, which not being able to
raise, they all dy’d for want of Food. After the same manner he dealt with the
neighboring People <i>Alcoholados</i>, of whom he got much Gold, but not without unheard
of Cruelties, for he burnt all their Villages and Houses, ruin’d the Countrey
with Fire and Sword from  <i>Thamaleque</i> to the River <i>Lebrixa</i>, carry’d away many
of the Natives coupled together with Chains about their Necks, and each of
them loaded with at least a hundred pound weight of pillag’d Goods; and as soon
as any of them began to faint under their Burthens for want of refreshment, their
Heads were immediately cut off. But <i>Alfinger</i> coming to certain cold Mountains,
was resisted by a valiant People; in which Conflict he receiv’d a Wound, of which
he dy’d at his return to <i>Coro</i>, Anno 1532. Upon which the <i>Welsares</i> sent <i>John Aleman</i>
to succeed him; but he also dying, made place for <i>George de Espoira</i>, and <i>Nicholas
Federman</i>, of which two <i>Espoira</i> being the chief, spent three years in ranging up and
down the Countrey, without any remarkable Transactions, being continually at
variance with his Lieutenant <i>Federman</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The afore-mention’d City <i>Venezuela</i>, otherwise call’d <i>Caro</i>, and by the Natives
<i>Corana</i>, was, <i>Anno 1559.</i> taken and burnt by the <i>English</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Provinces <i>Paragoana</i> and <i>Bariquicemeto</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Northward from the City, the Promontory <i>St. Roman</i>, in the Province of <i>Paragoana</i>,
runs into the Sea, opposite to the Islands <i>Aruba</i> and <i>Quuracao</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey <i>Paragoana</i> is low and full of Venison; out of the middle of it rises
a high Mountain, the Inhabitants whereof are very hospitable and courteous.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lyons that breed in this Countrey run away from Men; but on the contrary,
the Tygers are exceeding cruel.</p>

<p class='c010'>From <i>Coro</i> there leads a Way up into the Countrey over the Mountain <i>Xizaezaras</i>,
to the Province <i>Bariquicemeto</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Between both these Provinces very fruitful Valleys, which produce <i>Maiz</i> in
great abundance, are surrounded by wooddy Mountains, inhabited by Man-eaters,
call’d <i>Axaguas</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Segovia</i> built by <i>Juan de Villegas</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Anno 1552.</i> <i>Juan de Villegas</i> discovering the Province <i>Tucuyo</i>, he found several rich
Gold-Mines near the Mountain <i>Pedro</i>, out of which springs the River <i>Burio</i>. Near
this place he built the Town <i>Segovia</i>, which, by reason of the unwholsom Air, was
soon after transplanted, and built on the Shore of the River <i>Bariquicemeto</i>, so call’d,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_626'>626</span>because the Water when touch’d, turns to an Ash-colour. The Plain Countrey
round about would be intolerable hot, did not the cool Winds that blow from the
Mountains temper the same.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Natives of the Province <i>Bariquicemeto</i>, their manner of living.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Natives divided into Tribes that understand not one another, live on <i>Callibashes</i>,
Deers-flesh, Rabbets, and the Juice of the <i>Cocuy</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Rivers <i>Hacarigua</i> and <i>Boraute</i>, they throw the stamp’d Root <i>Barbasco</i>,
which causes the Fish to appear above the Water, and suffer themselves to be caught
with the Hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Summer they all store themselves with Venison, which they catch after
this manner: They set the dry Bushes and Brambles on fire, which makes the
wild Hogs, Goats, Deer, <i>Armadillo</i>’s, Tygers, the great Serpents <i>Bobas</i>, and other
wild Creatures, to leap forth from their Holes and Receptacles to shun the same,
whilest the Hunters standing ready with their Bowes and Arrows, seldom miss one
of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the hollow Trees near the Rivers, the Bees make abundance of Honey for
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Most of the Rivers here fall into the Stream <i>Huriapari</i>, which glides from the
<i>Peruvian</i> Mountains to the Northern Ocean.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Province <i>Chioas</i> produces plenty of Gold.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Also of the Natives about <i>Segovia</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Natives about <i>Segovia</i> go naked, are very ignorant, and much addicted to
Drunkenness; in which humor they kill one another: They live without care,
feeding on Roots till their <i>Maiz</i> is ripe, which in some places comes to its full maturity
in forty days time, and in others in three Moneths.</p>

<p class='c010'>Close by <i>Segovia</i> glides the Rivulet <i>Claro</i>, whose clear Water goes but a small
Course from its Fountain Head, before it sinks into the Ground; in the Summer it
is very high, and in the Winter almost destitute of Water.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Commodities of the Countrey hereabouts.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey breeds all sorts of Fowls, but especially Quails and Turtle-Doves.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cattel, Sheep, Goats and Hogs, increase wonderfully here, insomuch that many
of them are driven to be sold at <i>New Granada</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Cotton-Clothes that are woven here, also turn to a good account.</p>

<p class='c010'>From <i>Segovia</i> runs a Way through a Valley twelve Leagues long, to the Town
<i>Tucuyo</i>, which stands low, but in a healthful Climate, and surrounded with Mountains.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey hereabouts produces plenty of Corn, Pot-herbs, Sugar, and
Cotton; and feeds Oxen, Cowes, Horses, Sheep, Deer, and Goats, to which the
Tygers and Lyons do great mischief.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here are Gold-Mines, but they are not open’d by reason of the great want of
Men.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is likewise plenty of the <i>Bezoar</i>-Stones to be had here.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Cuycas, in whose Countrey stands the Town <i>Truxillo</i>, are a valiant, but very
cruel People.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lake <i>Maracabo</i>, running forty Leagues up into the Countrey, is ten Leagues
broad, Ebbs and Flows, and feeds the great Fish <i>Manati</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Westward dwell the <i>Pocabuyes</i>, and <i>Alcoholados</i>, both quiet and rich People.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Province <i>Xuruara</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Province <i>Xuruara</i> lies towards the South behind high Mountains, inhabited
by the valiant <i>Coromochos</i>; and towards the North from <i>Xuruara</i>, the <i>Bobures</i>, hard
by the City <i>Merida</i>; the Countrey about which is unhealthful and Morassy, and
the Inhabitants exceedingly plagu’d by the <i>Muschito</i>’s.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Havens of <i>Venezuela</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Haven <i>Maracapana</i> is the best in <i>Venezuela</i>, and lies in the Eastern part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_627'>627</span>Province, where the Mountains are inhabited by the wild <i>Chiugotos</i>, who kill and
eat all the <i>Spaniards</i> they can get.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other Havens Westward, not comparable to <i>Maracapana</i>, are <i>Flechado</i>, <i>Sardinas</i>,
and <i>Burburute</i>, where some <i>Spanish</i> Families have a Salt-pit.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Islands and Promontories.</div>

<p class='c010'>Six Leagues up in the Countrey you come to the fresh Lake <i>Tocarigua</i>, full of
little inhabited Isles; the People whereof live quietly, and barter Gold.</p>

<p class='c010'>Towards the North-West the Ocean makes the great Inlet <i>Triste</i>, before which
lies the Island <i>Bonaire</i>, very full of Cattel, and on each side appear the <i>Aves</i> and
<i>Quaraco</i>, which abound with Fowl.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Promontory <i>St. Roman</i> runs twenty Leagues into the Sea, and the Cape
<i>Coquibocoa</i> extends farther. Between both these runs the Channel of <i>Venezuela</i>,
which touches the Lake <i>Maracapabo</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before <i>Coquibocoa</i> are seen the four low Islands <i>Monjes</i>, with white sandy Creeks,
and full of Trees: out of the middlemost rises a high Mountain.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the Main Continent also the Mountains <i>De Azieyto</i> appear with scraggy tops
beyond the Point: And the Bay <i>Honda</i> affords a safe Road.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Cape <i>De la Vela</i> hath on one side the Inlet <i>Portete</i>, and on the other, the Villages
<i>Rancheria</i> and <i>Nostra Sennora de los Remedios</i>; between both which runs the
Stream <i>La Hacha</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>German</i> Commander, <i>Nicholas Federman</i>, intended to have built a City on
<i>Cape Vela</i>, Anno 1535. but finding the Ground too low and unfruitful, the Pearls
hereabouts very small, and the Natives living onely on Fish and wild Herbs, he
chang’d his Resolution.</p>

<h4 id='c627' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. IV.</span><br /> The Islands Margareta, Cubagua, and Coche.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>Notwithstanding we have already spoken something of the Islands <i>Margareta</i>,
and <i>Cubagua</i>, in regard they are by some reckon’d amongst the Isles of
<i>Northern America</i>; yet because they are by many accounted to make up a
part of the Division of <i>New Andalusia</i>, we shall add in this place what we have
found most worthy of Re-mention, though much to the same purpose as before.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Island <i>Margareta</i>, discover’d by <i>Christopher Columbus</i>, Anno 1498. contains
thirty two Leagues in circumference, hath many Woods and Pastures, yet little
fresh Water. To the Eastward of it lie the Cliffs <i>Testigos</i>, where it is very mountainous,
as also on the East. Round about the same are delicious Fish, without
which the Natives could not live, because the brackish Soil produces but little Provision.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Pearl-Fishing of <i>Margareta</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The chiefest thing for which this Island <i>Margareta</i> is famous, is the Pearl-Fishing,
for which in times past a great Trade was driven, though of late it is
come to little or nothing. The <i>Spaniards</i>, with inhumane cruelty, taught the <i>Negro</i>’s
to Dive for the Pearls, for those that were not nimble or dextrous enough,
they beat unmercifully, dropt scalding Wax or scalding Oyl upon them, or stigmatiz’d
them with hot Irons. The Pearl-Banks were cover’d with five, six,
seven, or eight Fathom Water; from whence the <i>Negro</i>’s pull’d the Oysters with
such force, that the Blood gush’d out of their Mouths and Noses when they came
above Water to breath; after which, to refresh them, they receiv’d a Glass of
Wine and a Pipe of Tobacco. The <i>Spanish Kiay</i> receiv’d a fifth part of the best
Pearls that were taken here; but whether the Oysters have forsaken this Place, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_628'>628</span>their growth hinder’d by often Fishing for them, we know not, but however it is,
few Pearls are found here of late years, which makes <i>Margareta</i> to be more and
more deserted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Nature of the Island of <i>Cubagua</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Between the Main Continent of <i>Paria</i> lie the Islands <i>Cubagua</i> and <i>Coche</i>; the first
whereof hath an unfruitful and sultry Soil, without either Trees, Birds, and four-footed
Beasts, except <i>Pock</i>-Wood, Sea-Fowls, or Parrots; and <i>Castilian</i> Hogs being
carry’d thither, change their Nature strangely; for in a short time their Claws
grow long and crooked.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The City <i>Nova Cadiz</i> built there, but at length totally deserted.</div>

<p class='c010'>The King of <i>Spain</i> us’d formerly to receive fifteen thousand <i>Ducats</i> yearly for
his fifth part of the Pearls that were taken; which Gain invited many thither, who
built the Town <i>Nova Cadiz</i> on <i>Cubagua</i> in the Year 1521. but when the <i>Arayans</i> demolish’d
the Monks Cloyster on <i>Paria</i>, the <i>Spaniards</i>, being three hundred in number,
fled from <i>Nova Cadiz</i> to <i>Hispaniola</i>, where the High Court, displeas’d at their
cowardly deserting the Place, gave them but cool Entertainment, and sent five
Ships under the Command of <i>Jacomo de Castellan</i> to <i>Cubagua</i>, to build new Store-houses
in <i>Nova Cadiz</i>, which was afterwards re-inhabited; but when the Pearl-Fishing
ceased, the Island and Town was at once deserted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Opposite to <i>Margareta</i> lies the Promontory <i>Araya</i>, behind which lies a salt Lake,
in which is found abundance of Salt, not onely above, but under the Water; with
which the <i>English</i>, <i>Spanish</i>, and <i>Dutch</i> Ships are fraighted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Du Verne</i>’s Description of the Salt-pans on <i>Araya</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Isaac du Verne</i> describes the Salt-pans on <i>Araya</i> thus: “Round about the same
(saith he) the Ground is craggy, barren, and of a brackish taste, and destitute of
fresh Water, which is therefore fetch’d three Leagues farther out of a Brook,
flowing from the Mountain <i>Bordones</i> into the Bay of <i>Comena</i>; likewise all manner
of Provisions are brought from other Parts. Westward from the Point <i>Araya</i> there
is a convenient Harbor where the Ships take in their Salt. Three hundred Paces
from the Shore lies a great Salt-pan, where the Salt being first beat in pieces, is
carry’d in Wheel-barrows to the Ships. The little Salt-pan produces less Salt,
and lies also out of the way, which makes few Ships take in their Lading from
thence.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey is every where overgrown with Brambles and Bushes, in which
breed Tygers and very poysonous Serpents. There are likewise abundance of
Stags, Bucks, Hares, and Coneys, besides other strange Beasts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Netherlanders</i> beaten out of their Salt-Trade here by the <i>Spaniards</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Till <i>Anno 1605.</i> the <i>Netherlanders</i> came hither unmolested for Salt, when eight
<i>Spanish</i> Gallions falling unawares upon them, strangely misus’d their Seamen; but
afterwards the <i>United Netherlands</i> having made an Agreement with <i>Spain</i> for a certain
time, renew’d their Trade to <i>Araya</i>, till the King of <i>Spain</i>, having for the better
security of the Place, built the Fort <i>St. Jago</i>, which Commanded the great Salt-pan,
forbad the <i>Netherlanders</i> from lading any more Salt; who thereupon Storm’d
the Fort, though to their cost, for several of them were kill’d, and the rest return’d
home empty.</p>

<h4 id='c628' class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sect. V.</span><br /> Of the Islands of Southern America.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>The chiefest islands of note in the Southern part of <i>America</i>, that is to say,
those that lie remote from the Continent in <i>Mare del Zur</i>, are <i>Los Ladrones</i>,
and the Islands <i>Fernandinas</i>; for the rest being, as we may call them, <i>Mediterranean
Islands</i>, fall naturally under the Description of the Continent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Isles <i>Los Ladrones</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_629'>629</span>1. <i>Los Ladrones</i>, in English, <i>The Islands of Thieves</i>, lie as it were in the mid-way
betwixt the Main Land of <i>America</i> and the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, but some hundreds of
Leagues distant from either, in the fourth Degree of Northern Latitude; so nam’d
by <i>Ferdinand Magellan</i>, from the pilfering disposition he observ’d in the Natives,
when he Sail’d that way for the <i>Moluccæ</i> Islands. They were a nimble and active
sort of People, yet light-finger’d, tall of stature, and going for the most part naked,
excellent Swimmers and Divers, and have not much more to be said in their commendation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Isles <i>Fernandinæ</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>2. The <i>Fernandinæ</i> are onely two Islands of no great bigness, lying over against
the Coast of <i>Chile</i>, in the three and thirtieth Degree of Southern Latitude, and
about a hundred Leagues, or three hundred <i>English</i> Miles from the Continent, yet
well stor’d with some lesser sorts of Cattel, as Goats, <i>&amp;c.</i> good plenty likewise of
Venison in the Woods, and Fish upon the Coasts; for which reason, though lying
at some distance, yet are they not a little frequented by the <i>Spaniards</i> of <i>Peru</i>, who
find many good Harbors and Roads for Shipping belonging to, and about these
Islands.</p>

The River <i>De la Plata</i>, by the Natives call’d <i>Paranaguazu</i>, is
next to the River of the <i>Amazones</i>, the greatest in the World,
and falls into the Northern Ocean between the Capes <i>Antonio</i>
and <i>Maria</i>, lying thirty Leagues one from another:
It receives from East and West divers Rivers as far as the
Lake <i>Xarays</i>, lying three hundred Leagues up in the Countrey
from the Mouth of <i>La Plata</i>. Also into the fore-mention’d
Lake fall several Streams, which spring out of the
<i>Peruvian</i> Mountains <i>Andes</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first that Sail’d into this great River, <i>Anno 1515.</i> to an Island lying in the
middle of it, was <i>John Dias de Solis</i>, who rashly going ashore, was kill’d and
eaten, together with several <i>Portugueses</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sebastian Gabottus</i> his Expedition.</div>

<p class='c010'>Eleven years after this Accident, <i>Sebastian Gabottus</i> set Sail from <i>Spain</i> to go to the
Spicy Islands through the Straights of <i>Magellan</i>, but was forc’d, for want of Provisions,
and the unwillingness of his Seamen, to put into the River <i>La Plata</i>; in
which being advanc’d thirty Leagues, he Anchor’d near an Island, which he call’d
<i>St. Gabriel</i>: from whence going seven farther, he discover’d a Stream which fell
into <i>La Plata</i>. This River he call’d <i>St. Salvador</i>, and cast up a Fort at the Mouth
of it, where an Inlet afforded a convenient Harbor for Shipping; he found the
River <i>La Plata</i> to be generally ten Leagues broad, and full of Isles; and to the Westward
of it, the River <i>Zaracaranna</i>, inhabited on the South side by a subtil People
call’d <i>Diagnitas</i>. At the place where <i>Zaracaranna</i> disembogues into <i>La Plata</i> he built
a Castle, and calling the same <i>Castello di Santo Spirito</i>, went up farther, leaving on
the West side the People <i>Tenbues</i>, <i>Mequaretas</i>, <i>Mepenes</i>, and <i>Aigais</i>; to the Eastward,
the <i>Quiloacas</i> and <i>Santana</i>, and struck up out of the River <i>La Plata</i>, North-East into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_631'>631</span>the Stream <i>Parana</i>, in which he had gone, two hundred Leagues, and pass’d by
many Isles, when he went out of the same into the Stream <i>Paraguay</i>; where being
set upon by the Countrey People, who were busie in Tilling the Ground, he lost
so many of his Men, that he was forc’d, without any farther Exploit, to return
with the <i>Portuguese</i> Pilot, <i>Diego Garcia</i>, who Sailing up the same River, had met
with <i>Gabottus</i> in <i>Paria</i>; and because both had gotten some Silver, they call’d the
River, from that Metal, <i>De la Plata</i>. The farther Discovery whereof lay neglected
nine years after, when <i>Peter Mendoza</i> Sailing with eleven Ships, carrying eight hundred
Men, to the Island <i>Gabriel</i>, built the Fort <i>Buenos Ayres</i>, on the South side of it,
where many People dying of Hunger, little was done.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Alvares Cabeca</i> not long after following <i>Mendoza</i>’s footsteps, discover’d and peopled
the Province <i>Rio de la Plata</i>. The Mouth of the River <i>La Plata</i> <i>Laurence Bikker</i>
describes thus:</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Laurence Bikker</i>’s Description of <i>Rio de la Plata</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>“Beyond the Cape <i>Santa Maria</i> (saith he) lies the flat Island <i>Castilhos</i>, having
scarce a Tree upon it; but on the North side a Rock, not unlike a decay’d Castle;
to the Southward of which appear two other Cliffs; directly before the Mouth
lies the stonie Island <i>De Lobos</i>, on which nothing is to be found but Sea-Wolves;
towards the East a stonie Bank runs a good way into the River, known by the
breaking of the Water upon the same.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Promontory <i>Maria</i> is low and barren, but within the same the Land rises
high before the Isles <i>Flores</i> and <i>Maldonado</i>, which last hath a good sandy Shore, Harbor,
and fresh Water between the Rocks; but <i>Flores</i> rising with two Hills, produces
nothing but Brambles.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Stream <i>Solis</i> also discharges its Waters in <i>La Plata</i>, near the Place where the
Mountain <i>Seredo</i> lies.</p>

<p class='c010'>The left Shore of <i>La Plata</i> begins at the Promontory <i>Antonio</i>, and is cut through
by the Rivers <i>Ortis</i> and <i>Los Sanctos</i>, where the Town <i>Buenos Ayres</i> is built on a
smooth Shore.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Martin del Barco</i>’s Description of the same.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Martin del Barco</i> proceeding in the Description of <i>La Plata</i>, saith that it is dangerous
by reason of the many Shelves that are in the same. The Isles in the River
are as followeth: those that bear the Name of <i>St. Gabriel</i> are five in number;
<i>Garcia</i> Isle is full of Trees, and for its fertility was peopled by <i>Peter de Mendoza</i>,
and afterwards by <i>Juan Ortiz Carate</i>: But less fruitful are the Isles <i>De Lazaro</i>, where
the River <i>Vrayg</i> unites with <i>La Plata</i>, being before fill’d with the Waters of <i>Salvador</i>,
which receives the black Stream <i>Negro</i>, which gliding slowly from Morasses, is very
full of Fish. Moreover, <i>La Plata</i> hath eleven Arms, each very deep and full of
Isles, inhabited by the <i>Guaranins</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>About a hundred Leagues farther the <i>Cherandies</i> have setled themselves on pleasant
Isles, lying not far from the City <i>St. Fe</i>, built on the Point which makes the
River <i>Bermeio</i>, where it falls into <i>La Plata</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Farther up lies the Province <i>Ana</i>, partly well inhabited for its fertility, and
partly overflow’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next appears the Rock <i>Pennapobre</i>, and not far from the Town <i>Guayra</i>, <i>La Plata</i>
falls very high from the Rocks.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The several People of this Countrey.</div>

<p class='c010'>But as concerning the Natives of this Countrey, it is inhabited by divers sorts of
People, differing from one another both in Customs and Language. On the South
side of the fore-mention’d River, from the Promontory <i>Antonio</i> to <i>Buenos Ayres</i>,
dwell the <i>Quirandies</i>, a stout, but cruel People, who with the Flesh of many a <i>Spaniard</i>
oftentimes keep a merry Feast. Farther into the Countrey run the <i>Juries</i> and
<i>Diagnitas</i>. Along <i>La Plata</i> lie also scatter’d the <i>Tenbues</i>, a civil People, who live
<span class='pageno' id='Page_632'>632</span>by Fishing. Near the River <i>Paraguay</i> the <i>Ameguaes</i> observe the same manner of Life;
But the <i>Carioes</i> keep Cattel, and Till their Lands. A hundred Leagues farther
dwell the <i>Payaguaes</i>; and yet farther into the Countrey the <i>Chames</i> and <i>Carcares</i> possess
much Gold and Silver, with which <i>Juan d’ Ayola</i> having enrich’d himself here,
was destroy’d with all his Men by the <i>Chames</i>, Anno 1541.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Nunnez Cabeca</i> his Journey.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Alvarez Nunnez Cabeca</i> came from <i>Spain</i> to be Governor here, but was not able, by
reason of contrary Winds and Tydes to reach <i>La Plata</i>; wherefore Landing at the
River <i>Itabucu</i>, and spending nine days in cutting a Way through thick Brambles,
he came to the Jurisdiction of <i>Armiriri</i>, and a days Journey farther to <i>Cipoyay</i>; and
not long after to <i>Tocanguazu</i>, where the <i>Guaranies</i>, who are the Natives, have two
Harvests every year of <i>Maiz</i> and <i>Cassavi</i>, and breed and keep Geese, Hens and Parrots
in their Houses: They are Man-eaters, and very revengeful. <i>Cabeca</i> having
given this Countrey the Name of <i>Vera</i>, he proceeded on his Journey over the Rivers
<i>Ignazu</i>, <i>Tibagi</i>, and <i>Taquari</i>, on whose Shore appears the Village <i>Abangobi</i>, and
somewhat farther <i>Tocanguzir</i>. The Countrey hereabouts is very fruitful, and hath
many delightful Plains, pleasant Rivers, and Woods; but beyond appear Hills,
Mountains, deep Morasses, dangerous Cane-Fields, Receptacles for wild Beasts,
and great Wildernesses. <i>Cabeca</i> having pass’d through them all, came into the
fruitful Countrey of the <i>Guaranies</i>, who are a wild People, and possess many
large Fields of <i>Maiz</i> and <i>Potato</i>’s, also several Silver Mines. From hence travelling
Westwardly over the River <i>Piqueri</i>, he spent eighteen days before he came to the
Stream <i>Ignazu</i>, which falls into the <i>Parana</i>, and at last came to the River <i>Paraguay</i>;
along whose Shore he found a People of a gigantick Stature, call’d <i>The Agazes</i>, who
regarded no manner of Husbandry, but went out continually a robbing in their
<i>Canoos</i>. These People, as <i>Martin del Barco</i> relates, were not long after all destroy’d
by the <i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not far from the <i>Agazes</i> dwell the <i>Guaycurues</i>, a valiant People; and somewhat
farther the <i>Cacoves</i>, whose Countrey produces Gold and Silver; and yet farther in
the Countrey reside the <i>Guaxarapos</i>, who remove yearly to the <i>Paraguay</i> to Fish there
when the Water is low; for in the beginning of <i>January</i> the River swells so exceedingly,
that the Countrey about it being overflow’d, is cover’d with above six Fathom
Water. The <i>Paraguay</i> discharges its Waters into the great Lake <i>Xarayes</i>, full
of Islands.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amongst other Rivers that spring out of the Mountains <i>Andes</i>, the <i>Ignazu</i>, along
whose Shore the People <i>Xacoaes</i>, <i>Xaquesses</i>, and <i>Chanesses</i> dwell, falls also into the
foremention’d Lake. Somewhat farther lies a great piece of drown’d Land, beyond
which the <i>Xarayes</i> have convenient Habitations, plant <i>Maiz</i>, and spin Cotton:
Their Countrey borders a great Wilderness, which ends about the Province <i>Tapuaguazu</i>,
the Inhabitants whereof, call’d <i>Tarapecocies</i>, are furnish’d with plenty of all
sorts of Provisions. The <i>Payzunoes</i>, dwelling on one side of them, are not well
known as yet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Beyond the Town <i>Assumption</i> dwell the <i>Mayaes</i>, in the Way to <i>Peru</i>, and border at
the <i>Tamacoaes</i>, both which possess Silver-Mines.</p>

<p class='c010'>Between <i>Buenos Ayres</i> and <i>Corduba</i> lies the Plain-Countrey <i>Despoplado</i>, ninety
Leagues long, without Trees or Houses, but is most Pasture-Ground, which feed
many thousands of wild Horses. From hence glide the Streams <i>Luchan</i>, <i>Los Arrechivos</i>,
<i>Arreca</i>, <i>Zaracaranna</i>, and others, into <i>La Plata</i>. It is very dangerous for a
small Company to travel through this Countrey, because the ranging <i>Furies</i> spare
none alive they meet with.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, the River <i>Grande</i> flows with a wide Mouth into the Sea, and spreads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_633'>633</span>it self within against the Countrey <i>Patos</i>. Also the Rivers <i>Tamandabug</i>, <i>Ararungo</i>,
and the Lake <i>Alagoa</i>, disembogue into the Ocean.</p>

<p class='c010'>North-East beyond <i>Alagoa</i> lie the Islands <i>Catharina</i> and <i>Gale</i>; and in the Bay <i>Tojuqua</i>
appear several Isles.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Streams <i>Tajahu</i> and <i>Ytabuca</i> spring out of high Mountains, inhabited by the
People <i>Anniriri</i> and <i>Cipopoy</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, the Countrey wash’d by the Stream <i>Ararapira</i>, produces all sorts of Provisions.</p>

<h3 id='c634' class='c001'>CHAP. II.<br /> Chili.</h3>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Cammel-Sheep</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>There are in this Countrey both tame and wild Sheep; the tame ones are
call’d <i>Cammel-Sheep</i>, being cover’d with long fine Wool, having Necks four
Foot long, their fore Feet cloven into four parts, their hindermost into
two, their Mouths very wide, which they open at those that vex them, and make
such a stink, that no body is able to abide near them; when tir’d, they fall under
their Burdens, and will not rise, though beaten never no much: Their Flesh is tough
like that of Horses. The wild Mountain-Sheep are red, and have soft glossy Wool,
which makes a Stuff like that of a Chamlet: These Sheep run swifter than a Horse;
the <i>Chileses</i> lead them by a Rope put through their Ears.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Grain <i>Teca</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey of <i>Chili</i> not onely produces Wheat, Barley, <i>Maiz</i>, and all manner
of Fruit, but also the <i>Teca</i>, which growing half a Yard high, is not unlike
Barley; the Grain thereof being dry’d in the Sun, is thresh’d, and parch’d in hot
Sand, then ground on a square flat Stone with a round Rowler. This Meal,
which is both exceeding wholsom and very nourishing (for a small Measure thereof
sufficeth a Man a whole Week,) serves also both for Meat and Drink: for being
infus’d in a greater quantity of Water, it becomes a pleasant Drink, and kneaded
with a lesser proportion, it is made into Cakes or Loaves.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fruit <i>Unni</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Fruit <i>Unni</i>, by the <i>Spaniards</i> call’d <i>Murtilla</i>, is like a little red Grape, and
hath a tart taste. The Wine press’d out of this Fruit is clear to the Eye, pleasing
to the Palate, and good for the Stomach, never causing any Head-ache: It also
makes good Vinegar.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the chiefest Benefit of <i>Chili</i> is the rich Gold-Mines. The Countrey for the
most part lies desolate, occasion’d by the continual Wars which the valiant People
<i>Arauco</i> maintain’d against the <i>Spaniards</i> after such a manner, that in no place of <i>America</i>
they met with such resistance, or sustain’d such Losses. They speak an elegant
Language, according to the testimony of <i>Elias Herkmans</i>, who having committed to
Writing all the most significant Words thereof which were taught him by the
<i>Chileses</i>, it will not be altogether amiss to set down some of them, which are these
following:</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The Seamen who went under <i>Hendrick Brewer</i>’s Command, <i>Anno 1643.</i> from
<i>Brasile</i> to <i>Chili</i>, brought the fore-mention’d Vocabulary along with them.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Chili</i> is look’d upon as no way inferior to any Countrey in <i>America</i>, enjoying
a wholsom Air, fruitful Soil, and abundance of Inhabitants, who often furnish
<i>Peru</i> with Provisions; which are the speedier convey’d thither, because the South-Winds
always blow along the Coast.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Peruvian</i> Vice-Roy keeps a Deputy to Govern here. It hath two Bishopricks,
<i>viz.</i> St. <i>Jago</i> and <i>L’ Imperial</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Nature, Customs, and Manners of the <i>Chileses</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Some of the <i>Chileses</i> are under the <i>Spaniards</i> Jurisdiction, and live in Huts;
others being wilder, defend their Freedom with the Sword. They have great
Heads and flat Noses: The Men continually pull out the Hair on their Faces and
Privities with Shells, which they carry about their Necks for that purpose, having
beforehand rubb’d the Hair with warm Ashes; the Hair of their Heads hanging
downwards is cut close as far as their Ears, the rest growing long, is ty’d with the
Ribbon <i>Tariwelonco</i>, to which Persons of Quality fix Silver Plates and <i>Turkoises</i>:
Some also cover their Heads with the Skins of Weazels, or the like Beasts, putting
the Head over their Foreheads, and the Tail down their Neck; which kind of Covering
they call <i>Maniewelonco</i>: Others wear Caps made after some strange manner
or other.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Chileses</i> are not the tallest, but strong and well set, betwixt a white and
sallow colour: Those that are in the <i>Spaniards</i> Service, wear long Hair, by which
they are distinguish’d from the shorn <i>Ucais</i>, who do the <i>Spaniards</i> all the mischief
imaginable. The Women are for the most part low of stature, but of a strong
Constitution, they go bare-headed, letting their Hair hang loose over their Shoulders,
except when they are indispos’d, and then they tie it up: But those that dwell
about <i>Castro</i> wear Locks like our <i>English</i> Ladies. In <i>Coquimbo</i> and <i>Loquimbo</i> they go
after the same manner as the <i>Peruvian</i> Women: All of them have thick black Hair.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Apparel, though mean, is neat: The Men wear wide Breeches girt about
their Wastes, and a piece of woollen Cloth, three Yards long and two broad, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_640'>640</span>having a Hole in the middle, they put over their Heads, and so let it hang on
their Shoulders, leaving their Arms and Legs bare; but on Festival Days they wear
curious embroider’d Stockings. The Women likewise cover themselves with the
same piece of Cloth, but after another manner, tying it first about their Middle,
then let it down to the Ground, pinn’d before with Silver or Golden Pins; their
Heads, Breasts and Legs are uncover’d; the Cloth it self is strip’d with red, white,
blue, and yellow, and fring’d at the edges. For an Example of their quick and
easie Labor, <i>Hendrick Brewer</i> relates, That a Woman being Deliver’d in his Ship,
within an hour after walk’d up and down the Deck, and gave the Child suck.
Some of them have such great Breasts, that throwing them over their Shoulders
they suckle their Children, being ty’d at their Backs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Huts being low, are made of Straw, Canes, and Boughs, and not built
for one single Family; for often thirty, fifty, a hundred, or a hundred and twenty
dwell under one Roof, and have a Governor, by them call’d <i>Caruca</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Housholdstuff is little and mean, <i>viz.</i> two or three Cans to keep their Liquor
<i>Chica</i> in, Horn Cups, a Stone whereon they grind their Corn, and one or two
woodden Stools: The chiefest of them also use Sheep-skins, which they spread on
the Ground before their Guests. They live without care, for they neither Sowe
nor Plant any more than will serve them a Year.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their Riches consist in Cattel, of which they have no great plenty.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the beginning of <i>October</i> a whole Town meets together to Plough and to
Sowe, which the Men perform in two days time, the rest of the Work being left
to the care of the Women; for the Men never meddle with Reaping or Harvest.</p>

<p class='c010'>They eat and drink from Morning to Evening, when they do not travel, for
then they eat at set-times. Their Liquor is made of Barley-Meal, or Wheat
boyl’d in Water. On Festival Days they drink <i>Chica</i>, Brew’d of <i>Maiz</i> chew’d by
the Teeth of old Women. They likewise make a Liquor of the Fruit <i>Unni</i>, which
tastes like <i>Madera</i> Wine.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Marriages.</div>

<p class='c010'>Every Man Marries as many Wives as he can buy and maintain, for Maids and
Widows must be sold by the Parents, who set not a Price upon them according to
their Beauty or Quality, but their skill in managing Houshold Affairs. Their
Marriages are perform’d after a strange manner: A Son having no Inheritance,
lives on the Charity of his nearest Relations, who Present him, one with a Hog,
another with a Cow, a third with a Sheep, and a fourth with somewhat else: thus
enrich’d, he goes to his Mistresses Father, and hangs some <i>Turkoises</i> and Plates of
Silver about his Neck, and acquainting him with what Estate he can make his
Wife, he agrees as well as he can with his intended Father-in-law, to whom he
gives ten, fifty, or a hundred Sheep, Oxen, Cows, Hogs, Horses, Poultrey, a Coat,
and some Vessels full of <i>Chica</i>; which done, the Father leads his Daughter to the
Bridegroom’s House, where he is Entertain’d with Meat, but finds the Drink at his
own Cost. Some days after the Celebration of the Wedding, the nearest Relations
come to congratulate the young Marry’d Woman, and at Dinner sing an <i>Epithalamium</i>
to their Nuptial Deity <i>Maruapeante</i>, all of them sitting on the Ground on
Sheep-skins. The Allies often take away a Woman from her Husband, especially
when he misuses her; and if a Man kill his Wife, her Death is reveng’d by her Relations.
Persons of Quality build a Hut for every one of their Wives, sending word
to her whom they have a mind to enjoy: They respect one above the rest, who
are in a manner but Slavesses, being forc’d to do all the Drudgery. The Men are
exceeding jealous and chollerick, cruelly beating their Wives, if they chance but to
look on another Man; and if they take them in the Act of Adultery, they immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_641'>641</span>kill them; yet for all this they are not Chaste, but very Libidinous. As
soon as a Woman is Deliver’d of a Child, she washes her self and the Child in cold
Water; then kills a Lamb call’d <i>Chiluraque</i>, makes a Feast; at which she her
self eats and drinks freely amongst the rest, and the next day goes about her usual
Employment.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spaniards</i> tell us, that their Women, if they continue long in this Countrey,
are more and more hardned by the Air, and are as little concern’d at the Birth of a
Child as the Natives.</p>

<p class='c010'>A Widow hath free leave to Marry again, provided she hath given to her Children
part of what she hath; but if she Marry not, but return to her Parents, then
she is highly esteem’d of.</p>

<p class='c010'>Both Men and Women wash themselves in the Rivers in the coldest Weather.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Religion, and manner of burying their Dead.</div>

<p class='c010'>They adore chiefly their Deity <i>Pillan</i>, and the Devil, who doth them much hurt.
They acknowledge no Resurrection, accounting long Life in this World the greatest
Good; wherefore when any one dies, the Friends and Relations make a doleful
Cry, and suffer the dead Body to lie three, nay, four Moneths before they bury
them, stuffing them full of strong smelling Herbs, to keep them from putrifying:
Three days before their Interrment the nearest Allies meet, kill a Sheep, make
Merry, and throw the Body into a Hole near the Hut in which the Deceased dwelt,
putting also a piece of the slain Sheep, and a Jug full of the Liquor <i>Chica</i>, into
the Grave.</p>

<p class='c010'>Concerning their Idol <i>Pillan</i>, to whom with strange Gestures they Sing divers
Songs, they believe that he is a Spirit of the Air, and Governs all things on Earth.
Some suppose him to be Thunder, and therefore they worship him in a most particular
manner when they hear it Thunder; for then they stick an Arrow and
Stone Ax into the Ground, and take Arms into their Hands, putting themselves
into a posture as if they should suddenly be set upon by a mighty Enemy, and
look’d upon it heretofore as a fore-running of the <i>Spaniards</i> approach, whose Cruelties
they exceedingly dreaded.</p>

<p class='c010'>They call all their Hero’s <i>Pillans</i>, and ascribe Divine powers to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>They take very much strong Tobacco, the Smoak whereof puffing in the Air
with strange Gestures, they cry, <i>Receive this, O Pillan</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their cruel usage of Prisoners.</div>

<p class='c010'>When they return home Conquerors from any Victory, they put a Stone Ax
into the Ground, and standing Arm’d round about the same, Drink exceedingly,
and sing a Song in honor of <i>Pillan</i>. They use their Prisoners very cruelly, for
forcing them to Dance and make Merry amongst them, they on a sudden cleave
their Heads with an Ax, pull their Hearts out of their Bodies, and bite the same
with their Teeth. After the same manner they punish their Robbers and
Traitors; but those that have good store of <i>Chica</i> to Present the Governors with,
escape the Execution: Yet this cannot buy off Sorcerers or Witches, who are
without mercy burnt alive, with all they enjoy’d.</p>

<p class='c010'>They have no Priests, nor any that pretend to any religious Function; onely
those that can Sing the <i>Pawary</i> well, are in great esteem amongst them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their second Deity <i>Maruapeante</i> (they say) informs them in a Dream when they
must Marry; but he doth not do them this kindness before they have made themselves
Drunk, and sung Sonnets to his praise.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The manner of chusing the <i>Nentoque</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey is Govern’d by prime Persons, call’d <i>Ulmen</i>, or peculiar Lords,
call’d <i>Curacen</i>. The <i>Ulmens</i> and <i>Curacens</i> Command twenty five, sometimes fifty,
a hundred Families: Their Power consists in calling all the People together, and
consulting with them about State-Affairs, which they dare not do with any particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_642'>642</span>Person, nor Levy any Tax without extraordinary occasion. They are bound
to march in the Front of their Subjects against an Enemy, and are under a Governor-General
call’d <i>Apocurace</i>, or under a <i>Nentoque</i>. Other lesser Offices are dispos’d
of by the <i>Curaces</i>, or <i>Pulmenes</i>; but their <i>Netonques</i> are chosen after this manner, <i>viz.</i>
When that honorable Place is vacant, then whoever aims at it, computes with himself
whether his Means will extend so far as to treat the <i>Curaces</i> and <i>Pulmenes</i> with a
noble Treat; which if he is able to do, then he sends for them to an appointed
place, whither they all go Arm’d, and whilest they are eating and drinking, he that
desires the Place begins to tell them of his noble Extract, valiant Exploits, Riches,
and eminent Relations, and therefore desires the Place of the deceased <i>Nentoque</i>:
then the <i>Curace</i> rising, the intended <i>Nentoque</i> hangs a Chain of <i>Turkoises</i>, or Cockle-shells
about his Neck; whereupon the <i>Curace</i> moves the rest to the Election,
without any Articles, the new <i>Nentoque</i> onely promising to Govern all things for
the best advantage and benefit of the common State: which done, the <i>Curace</i> takes
the Chain of <i>Turkoises</i>, and distributes them amongst the primest Persons of Quality,
and so they end the Day in Drinking, Dancing and Singing.</p>

<p class='c010'>After the same manner they chuse an <i>Apocurace</i> or prime Governor; which of
late the <i>Uca</i>’s, that they may enjoy the more Priviledge themselves, have not
elected.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Arms.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Chileses</i> Arms consist of Lances as long again as the <i>Europeans</i>, made
sharp at the Points. They all use Clubs plated with Iron, and <i>Spanish</i> Swords.
The <i>Pulches</i>, who dwell behind the high Mountains <i>Cordilbra</i>, use poyson’d Arrows,
make Helmets and Breastplates of Ox-hides, which neither Sword nor Arrow can
enter: they all know how to manage a Horse, and the use of a Lance, but are
very much afraid of Musquets or Fire-locks.</p>

<p class='c010'>Because they can neither write nor read, the Governor by a faithful Messenger
sends to his inferior Officers such Commands as he judges may tend to the most
advantage of the Publick both in Peace and War. This Messenger carries an
Arrow with a Ribbon, as a Sign of his Employment; the Arrow is held in the
Right-hand, and if he who receives it will answer the Message, then he sends back
the same Arrow with another; but if he judges it convenient to acquaint any other
<i>Curaces</i> and <i>Pulmenes</i> with the same Message, then he sends one of his own Servants
to them with the same Arrow.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A particular Account of <i>Chili</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>As touching the Climate and Production of <i>Chili</i>, this Account is given by an
Eye-witness: “The Winter Season (saith he) is so tempestuous, that sometimes
the Trees are not onely blown up by the Roots, but the Earth it self is rent asunder;
some Valleys being fill’d with Snow, swell the Rivers exceedingly when
it melts, which overflowing part of the Countrey, makes the same very fruitful.
It is also extream cold here, because such sharp Winds blow from the Mountains,
that they pierce through the Skin and Flesh of a Man: and indeed these
Winds would make the whole Countrey desolate, were not the Mountains overgrown
with great Oaken Trees, against which the Wind breaks. Moreover, the
Valleys produce Coals, which serve the Inhabitants for Fewel. The Winter bereaves
the Trees of Leaves; but not those which grow in the Wildernesses. In
<i>March</i> the Fields are full of innumerable sorts of sweet-smelling Flowers; out of
some whereof are boyl’d the <i>Angel-Water</i>, so call’d for its smell and wholsom
taste. The Grass grows in <i>November</i> and <i>December</i> as high as our standing Corn.
Turnips, Mint, Clover, and Mustard-seed, grow naturally for several Leagues
together. Likewise excellent Physical Herbs grow here, whose power and operation
their Doctors, call’d <i>Maci</i>, keep from the <i>Spaniards</i>. These <i>Maci</i> are in great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_643'>643</span>esteem, not onely amongst the <i>Chileses</i>, but also the <i>Spaniards</i>, for their great skill
in Physick. Amongst these Herbs the chiefest is call’d <i>Quincia-mali</i> which grows
but half a hands-breadth above the Ground, and spreads into several Stalks
like a Nosegay; and on each Stalk is a Saffron-colour’d Flower. This Herb
pull’d Up with the Root, and boyl’d, and the Decoction given to any one that is
bruis’d within, works most wonderfully, for it draws out the putrifi’d Blood,
though sunk never so deep in the Wound. Moreover the Juice of <i>Culen</i> is also
very healing, if us’d for an Ointment, or pour’d on any Wound. This Herb, by the
<i>Spaniards</i> call’d <i>Albaciga</i>, hath sweet-smelling Leaves, and a tall Body. In some
places also grows an Herb, not unlike Grass, which boyl’d in Water, immediately
cures the Feaver and Spleen, and cleanses the Blood. There are likewise
Medicines here, which dissolving the Stone in the Bladder or Kidneys, cause it to
be urin’d forth. The Plant <i>Luce</i>, which grows out of rented Rocks which are
often overflow’d by the Sea, makes a sort of well tasted Bread.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Wilderness <i>Atacama</i>, which makes a Boundary betwixt <i>Peru</i> and <i>Chili</i>, extends
Northward ninety Leagues, is dry and barren in Summer, and in the Winter exceeding
cold, and cover’d with Snow. No Provision is to be found upon it, except
a few wild Sheep, call’d <i>Guanacos</i>. About the middle thereof the Brook <i>La Sal</i>
rising in the Eastern Mountains, flows Westward through a deep Valley to the
Southern Ocean.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Troublesom Passage from <i>Peru</i> to <i>Chili</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Water of the fore-mention’d Brook put into any Vessel, immediately turns
to Salt, and all along the Shore lie greater or lesser pieces of Salt; so that the Way
from <i>Peru</i> to <i>Chili</i> through <i>Atacama</i> is very troublesom: but that which leads thither
over the snowy Mountains <i>Andes</i>, is much worse, because it is farther about,
and threatens the Traveller with Destruction, if he observe not the right Season of
the Year; for in the Winter there blows such a cold Wind on these Mountains, that
a Man, being suddenly benumm’d, falls down dead on the Ground, and grows stiff
against all putrefaction. <i>Joseph de Acosta</i> tells us, that Bodies have been found there
as firm and sound, as if they had been living, which had some years before breath’d
their last on the said Mountains.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Valley <i>Copayapo</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>But <i>Diego Almagro</i>, who first discover’d <i>Chili</i>, Anno 1536. went thither with two
Companies of Horse, and five hundred Foot, through the Countreys <i>Charcas</i>, <i>Chicas</i>,
<i>Xuxayes</i>, and <i>Chaquana</i>, and having pass’d over a craggy Soil and the snowy Mountains
<i>Andes</i>, he entred into the first <i>Chilean</i> Valley <i>Capayapo</i>, having lost no small
number of Men and Horses with Hardship and Cold; the inconvenience therefore
of both the fore-mention’d Ways between <i>Peru</i> and <i>Chili</i>, forc’d Travellers to
go along the Shore wash’d by the Southern Ocean. <i>Copayapo</i> bears that Denomination
from the <i>Turkoises</i> which a Mountain produces there in great abundance.
The Valley it self is the fruitfullest of all <i>Chili</i>; for in no place the <i>Maiz</i> grows better,
and in greater abundance than here, the Ears being half a Yard long, and the
Stalks the length of a Lance; each Grain that is Sow’n, yields at least three hundred
in Harvest. All <i>Spanish</i> Fruits grow better here than in <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Through the midst of <i>Copayapo</i> runs a River of the same Denomination, and
twenty Leagues in length from the <i>Andes</i>, and at its Mouth hath a convenient Harbor
before the South Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>The South part of <i>Copayapo</i> borders the Valley <i>Guasco</i>, which is less fruitful than
the first, but hath a convenient Haven, into which falls a fresh River, penn’d in by
Sluces for the watering of the Cane-Fields. Moreover, there are plenty of Partridges;
also wild Sheep and grey Squirrel-skins are of a great value. To the
Southward flow also the Rivers <i>Maypo</i>, <i>Chacha</i> Pool, <i>Loro</i>, and <i>Moule</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_644'>644</span>Beyond these Streams Eastward, the <i>Promouca</i>’s dwell near the Mountains <i>Andes</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Valley <i>Chili</i>, which gives Denomination to the whole Countrey, were
formerly the famous Gold-Mines <i>Quillatas</i>, from whence <i>Valdivia</i>, Anno 1544. carry’d
an invaluable Treasure. The South Sea makes here a large and convenient
Harbor for all manner of Vessels, built two Leagues below the City <i>Serena</i>, at a little
River, which so moistens the low Countrey, that it produces all manner of
Plants. It rains here not above three times a year.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the Entertainment which Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> met withal here, may sufficiently
be conjectur’d the Power of <i>Serena</i>; for when the <i>English</i> Landed here for
Water, they were driven away not without great loss by three hundred <i>Castilian</i>
Horse, and two hundred Foot that Sally’d out of the City. The Mines, though
they inclose much Gold, yet they produce but little, because the <i>Spaniards</i>, according
to the testimony of a <i>Chilean</i> Pilot, whom <i>Oliver Van Noort</i> took Prisoner, destroy’d
all the ancient Inhabitants that should have help’d them to dig the Gold.</p>

<p class='c010'>The City <i>St. Jago</i>, lying near the Stream <i>Topocalma</i>, receives great benefit by the
Haven <i>Valparayso</i>, which makes the fore-mention’d River, because in that Haven
all Goods that come from <i>Lima</i> are unladen, and the Goods shipp’d aboard. The
Countrey about the same produces plenty of Wines, Apples, Corn, and all sorts of
Cattel, and especially Horses in such abundance, that thousands of them run wild.</p>

<p class='c010'>In <i>Valparayso</i> Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> took a Ship from <i>Valdivia</i>, laden with two thousand
five hundred Bars of fine Gold. But the <i>Netherland</i> Admiral, <i>Joris Spilbergen</i>,
had not such good success, who Sailing thither with five Ships, <i>Anno 1615.</i> discover’d
a <i>Spanish</i> Ship in the Harbor; where sending his Boats well Mann’d to fetch
off a Vessel that lay hal’d on the Shore, they found it burning, and thereupon Steer’d
their Course into a little Inlet full of Rocks, which serv’d the <i>Spaniards</i> in stead of
Breast-works; for lying behind them, they fir’d continually on the <i>Hollanders</i>; yet
<i>Spilbergen</i> Landing with two hundred Men, met a considerable number of <i>Spanish</i>
Soldiers, and Horses drawn out on the Shore, from whom they soon fled.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before the City <i>La Conception</i> lies the Island <i>Quiriquyna</i>, whose Straw Huts <i>Spilbergen</i>
laid in Ashes.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the time when <i>Oliver Van Noort</i> came to an Anchor here, the Governor <i>Franciscus
de Quinones</i> Commanded seven hundred <i>Spanish</i> Soldiers to reduce the revolted
<i>Chileses</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Four Leagues from <i>Conception</i> lie the rich Gold-Mines <i>Quilacoya</i>, which formerly
produc’d great Riches.</p>

<p class='c010'>Over against the Valley <i>Arauco</i>, which rises out of the Sea, lies the Island <i>Maria</i>,
in a large Inlet made by the force of the Waves.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here grows abundance of Wheat and Barley. The Rivers also afford plenty
of Fish, amongst which there is one call’d <i>The Lake-Spider</i>, in whose Eyes are to be
seen little Specks, which would exceed Pearl, if they were but hard enough.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two <i>Spaniards</i> Command forty Natives on <i>Maria</i>, and keep them in such slavery,
that they may neither eat Apples, Pears, Grapes, Poultrey, or Sheep, though they
are there in great abundance.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Elias Herkmans</i> was once in probability to have taken possession of this Island for
the <i>Netherland</i> State, had he not been prevented by an extraordinary occasion.</p>

<p class='c010'>Between the Towns <i>Conception</i> and <i>Imperial</i> lie the Provinces <i>Arauco</i>, <i>Tucapel</i>, and
<i>Puren</i>, inhabited by a valiant People, that often alarm the <i>Spaniards</i>. In each Province
<i>Valdivia</i> built a Fort in the Year 1551. eight Leagues distant from one another.
He also discover’d the rich Gold-Mines <i>De Ongol</i>, and built the Fort <i>Confines</i> there.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Valdivia</i> taken Prisoner and cruelly put to death by the <i>Indians</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Natives hereabouts being exceedingly opprest by the <i>Spaniards</i>, fell upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_645'>645</span>the Fort in <i>Puren</i>, where those in the Garrison, unable to defend themselves, went
to <i>Tucapel</i> and from thence to <i>Arauco</i>, to Settle there. <i>Valdivia</i> marching with three
hundred Men to the Castle in <i>Tucapel</i>, was so fiercely assaulted at the River <i>Leto</i>,
that all his Men were kill’d, and he himself being taken Prisoner, had melted Gold
pour’d down his Throat: One Boy onely escaping, brought the news to those in
Garrison in the Fort <i>Arauco</i>, who fled to <i>La Conception</i>, as those from <i>Puren</i> to <i>Imperial</i>.
Not long after the Lieutenant <i>Francisco de Villagra</i> went with a hundred and sixty
Soldier’s to <i>Raquetta</i>, a Promontory against the South Sea in <i>Arauco</i>, to take Revenge
for the Death of his General <i>Valdivia</i>; but he also had like to have follow’d
the same fate, for he left ninety six Men behind him, and with much ado recover’d
<i>La Conception</i>: By which means the victorious <i>Chileses</i> came to be so much fear’d,
that the <i>Spaniards</i> forsook the Towns <i>Rica</i>, <i>St. Jago</i>, and <i>Confines</i>, and fortifi’d themselves
strongly in <i>Imperial</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of <i>Arauco</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Concerning <i>Arauco</i>, it is a small County, twenty Leagues long and seven broad.
The Inhabitants thereof are strangely valiant; those that inhabit the Mountains are
call’d <i>Pulches</i>, and are generally of a duller Spirit than those that dwell in the Valleys;
all of them use long Pikes, Halberds, Bowes and Arrows, Helmets, and
Breastplates of Deer-skins, in the Wars; they know when to close and open their
Ranks, and stand in good order according to Martial Discipline, which makes the
<i>Spanish</i> King receive little benefit from <i>Arauco</i>, though it is full of rich Mines, because
those in Garrison being five hundred in number, dare not come out of their
Fort.</p>

<p class='c010'>To <i>Arauco</i> belongs the Island <i>La Mocha</i>, low on the North side, and rocky on the
South; against which the Ocean breaks its Billows: in the middle of it rises a
split Mountain, out of whose Gap flows a fresh Brook; the fruitful Soyl produces
abundance of Pumpcons, Maiz, Potato’s, and all manner of delicious Fruit, as
also Oxen, Sheep, and other Cattel, which go grazing up and down in great
Herds; the Village that is upon it boasts about fifty Huts, built long of Straw,
with a Door in the middle, and round like an Arch on the top.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Van Noon</i>’s and <i>Spilbergen</i>’s Entertainment in <i>Mocha</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> and <i>Candish</i> were formerly somewhat roughly Entertain’d here
by the Inhabitants: but they shew’d themselves somewhat more civil to the <i>Dutch</i>
Admirals, <i>Oliver Van Noort</i> and <i>Joris Spilbergen</i>: The first coming to an Anchor here
<i>Anno 1600.</i> put one <i>John Claeszoon</i> (Condemn’d for some great Crime to be Landed
on some strange Place) ashore on <i>La Mocha</i>, with a few Trifles; for which being
kindly Entertain’d, the Seamen resolv’d to go ashore the next day, who were likewise
civilly Treated. The Governor of <i>Mocha</i> coming aboard, Lodg’d a Night in
the Ship, and afterwards conducted the Admiral through the Village, but forbad
the Seamen from entring any of the Huts; out of which the Women upon the
hearing of a sudden noise, came running out, and kneel’d down on the Ground in
three Parties, whilest an old Matron came forth with a Pitcher full of <i>Chica</i>, and
gave each of the <i>Netherlanders</i> a Cup full to drink, sitting on Blocks in the Fields.</p>

<p class='c010'>A Man Marries as many Wives here as he can maintain. They all live peaceably
one with another, and go Cloth’d with a pair of Breeches, and Frock without
Sleeves. The Women tie their Hair in Braids about their Heads, but the Men let
it hang down carelesly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fifteen years after <i>Spilbergen</i> Landing here with four well Mann’d Boats, found
the Shore full of People, who had brought all manner of Provisions to barter
against Axes and Knives. The Islanders going aboard, wondred to see the Soldiers
drawn out in order, and much more when a Gun was fir’d: They furnish’d the
<i>Hollanders</i> with a hundred Sheep, amongst which was one with an extraordinary
long Neck, and Legs, Hair, Mouth, and Back like a Cammel.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_646'>646</span>The  <i>Netherland</i> Admiral, <i>Hendrick Brewer</i>, coming to an Anchor on the Coast of
<i>Guadalanquen</i>, Anno 1643. was inform’d by the <i>Chileses</i>, that about four years before
they had burnt <i>Baldivia</i>, murder’d the <i>Spaniards</i> that were in Garrison, and
pour’d melted Gold down the Governor’s Throat and into his Ears, and made a
Drinking-Cup of his Scull, and Trumpets of his Shin-bones. <i>Brewer</i> also found
some Ruines of the City, which formerly boasted four hundred and fifty Houses,
and was not yet so utterly defac’d, but that the two Markets and cross Streets were
plainly to be seen, and the Walls gave sufficient testimony of its ancient lustre.
The Countrey round about produces Wheat and Barley; neither are there any
Mines to be found that produce finer Gold than those which are hereabouts. In
the Mouth of the River which runs to <i>Baldivia</i>, lies a small Isle, the Men whereof
are gross and fat, and spend their time in Drinking and Dancing, whilest the Women
do all the Work.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the City <i>Osorno</i>, though lying under a cold Climate, is a Soil full of
Gold-Mines, where above two thousand <i>Chileses</i> are under the subjection of the
<i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since  <i>Teunis Swarte-Teun</i> conquer’d and ruin’d this Place with small Forces under
<i>Spilbergen</i>’s Command, it hath not yet repair’d its Losses: The Ruines of great
Buildings are sufficient testimonies of its former splendor.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the utmost Point of the Island, on which <i>Osorno</i> is built, lies the Village <i>Carel-Mappo</i>,
burnt by <i>H. Brewer</i>, An. 1643. for he Landing sixty six Men here, under the
Command of the Ensign <i>Blauewenhaen</i>, they Engag’d with ninety <i>Spaniards</i> who betook
themselves to the Woods, leaving six Men and fifteen Horses behind them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the Sea-Coast of <i>Chili</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Sea-Coast of <i>Chile</i> lies as followeth: It begins on the North with the Valley
<i>Copayapo</i>, runs Southerly to the Haven <i>Coquimba</i>, and makes the large Inlet <i>Atongayo</i>;
the convenient Harbor <i>Quintero</i>, at the Mouth of the River <i>Concagua</i>, is also to
the Southward.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next <i>Quintero</i> follow the Havens <i>Valparaysa</i>, <i>Topocalma</i>, and <i>Penco</i>, known by several
Mountains cover’d with Snow.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Stream <i>Labapi</i> disembogues also in the Bay <i>Arauco</i>, where the Sea washing
over the Shore, makes good Salt.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the Shore of the River <i>Lebo</i>, <i>Garcias Mendoza</i> built the Town <i>Canete</i>, which
not long after was deserted, by reason of the Wars with the <i>Chileses</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the Haven <i>Carnero</i> a Channel runs to the City <i>Confines</i>: also the River
<i>Cauten</i> makes a convenient Harbor before the City <i>Imperial</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next appear the Streams <i>Tolten</i>, <i>Queule</i>, <i>Valdivia</i>, <i>Chabin</i> and <i>Bueno</i>; and near
the Promontory <i>Gallego</i>, <i>Chili</i> ends to the South.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Province <i>Tucuman</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Eastward up into the Countrey lies the great Province <i>Tucuman</i>, inhabited by
three sorts of People, <i>viz.</i> <i>Juries</i>, <i>Diagnitas</i>, and <i>Tucumans</i>, from whom the Countrey
receives its Denomination, and juts Northward against the <i>Chicas</i>, belonging to the
rich Plate-Countrey <i>Potosi</i>, Eastward towards the Province <i>La Plata</i>, and Westward
towards the South Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Ground about the City <i>St. Jago del Estero</i>, formerly call’d <i>Vares</i>, being the
Bishop’s See, and Residence of the Governors, is brackish and sandy. The Citizens
are most of them Weavers; the Natives go Cloth’d, and are of an affable
Temper and Disposition.</p>

<p class='c010'>The River <i>Estera</i> yearly overflows the Countrey, which being dung’d with
Mud, produces abundance of <i>Maiz</i>, Barley, Wheat, and all manner of Fruits.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Stream <i>Salado</i> runs the same Course as the <i>Estera</i>, from the West to the East
through a Plain-Countrey, but hath brackish Water, and abundance of Fish. Between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_647'>647</span>both these Rivers the Inhabitants get plenty of Honey, Wax, Cotton, and
<i>Cochenile</i>. Cattel also increases in abundance, as likewise Deer, and other Venison;
and for Fowl, Partridges, Pigeons, and the like;  but the Tygers and Lyons do
much mischief to the Inhabitants. Their chief Commodities for Trade and Merchandise
are Cloth, Cotton and Salt.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Garcias Mendoza</i> built the Towns <i>Neuva Londres</i> in the Province <i>Calchaqui</i>, and <i>Gorduba</i>
in the Territory of the <i>Juries</i>, but they were both of them soon deserted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Behind <i>Peru</i> and <i>La Plata</i> the Plains <i>Omaguaza</i> extend themselves along the Rivers
<i>Paraguay</i> and <i>Bermeio</i>, under a temperate Climate, where the Inhabitants go
Clothed, and keep abundance of Cattel.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Productions of the Countrey, and Nature of the People.</div>

<p class='c010'>In most places hereabouts breed wonderful large Baboons, with long Tails and
Beards; which being wounded, pull the Arrows out of the Wound, and throw
back the same with a grim Countenance at those that shoot them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Serpents are likewise so big here, that they swallow whole Deer.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Rivers breed horrid Crocodiles, and the Woods, Lyons and Tygers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Inhabitants differ both in their Customs and Language: the generality of
them are continually Drunk. They keep yearly a great Feast, to reconcile the
Souls of their Predecessors to them; to which purpose they bring as many roasted
Ostriches as they have Souls to Offer to; then Drink three days after, and on the
last they carry the Head of a fair Virgin (who freely offers her self to be kill’d)
about the Town, making a sad and lamentable noise for the space of an hour; at
the end of which they all begin to laugh, and oftentimes fall a killing one another:
which Custom is most observ’d amongst the <i>Matarani</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Abipones</i> go naked in Summer, and in the Winter Clothe themselves with
Furrs; they Paint their whole Bodies with Spots like the Tygers, Carve their Bodies
all over, making Cut-work of their Skins, into which they stick Ostriches
Feathers, as also through their Nostrils, Lips, and Ears, and account Baldness the
greatest Beauty. They honor those for their Gods, who patiently endure unsufferable
Tortures. The Women hang their Faces and Breasts full of Pearls: They
never bring up above two Children, for they kill all above that number.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Planies</i> range up and down without Habitations under the open Skie.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Giants <i>Tobae</i> speak a curious Language, but are very salvage and cruel.
<i>Anno 1571.</i> <i>Erouaca</i>, a prime Man amongst them, devour’d his own Sister, Wife,
Mother, and Children. When they design to go a Journey, they roast their Sons
and Daughters, to serve them for Provisions in stead of other Flesh; and their Sick
are upon the least Complaint bury’d alive.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Caaguiaares</i>, who dwell in Huts in great Woods, feed on Woorms, Mice,
Apes, Tygers, and wild Honey; most of them are bunch-back’d, and go clad
with the Skins of wild Beasts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Several Voyages to <i>Magellanica</i>.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Northward against <i>Chili</i> and <i>Rio de la Plata</i> juts the Countrey, which from
<i>Ferdinand Magaglianus</i> is wrongly call’d <i>Magellanica</i>; to which several Voyages
have been made by sundry People from the North-Sea to the Southern
Ocean, divers Steering still new Courses: for some follow’d the <i>Straights</i> of
<i>Magellan</i>; others Sail’d more or less South-West: By which means <i>Le Mair</i> open’d
a new Passage between <i>Mauritius</i> and the <i>States-Island</i>; and <i>H. Brewer</i>, a Way below
the <i>States-Island</i>; yet all Steer’d their Course Westerly, so that none of them return’d
the same Way, except <i>Elias Herkmans</i> and Capt. <i>Ladrillero</i>, the last of whom coming
from <i>Chili</i> to go to the North-Sea, met with such Storms, that he was forc’d to
Tack about, and stand back again to <i>Chili</i>, as <i>Herkmans</i> did from <i>Chili</i> to <i>Brasile</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Pedro Sarmiento</i>’s Expedition.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Anno 1579.</i> <i>Peter Sarmiento</i> weigh’d Anchor with two Ships, and Sailing from
<i>Callao de Lima</i> through the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i> to <i>Spain</i>, ran by the Isles <i>Felix</i> and
<i>Amber</i>, discover’d in one Inlet eighty five Isles, most of them desolate, sounded all
the Havens, found abundance of Oysters with Pearls in them, call’d an Inlet <i>Francisco</i>,
and a Mountain on the right-hand, <i>Punta de la Gente Rubra</i>, because the Inhabitants
thereof painted their Bodies red, found the Havens <i>Misericordia</i> and <i>Candelaria</i>,
and the Island <i>Sataynes</i>, where five of the Natives gave him an Account of
Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>, for whom he Cruis’d, and had sight of a snowy Mountain,
whose top vomited Fire. On the Promontory <i>Ana</i> he erected a woodden Cross,
and laid a Writing under the same, wherein he advertis’d all Persons to take notice,
that Pope <i>Alexander</i> the Sixth had freely given the King of <i>Spain</i> all the Countreys
thereabouts. Not long after he Steer’d through the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i> along
the Coast of <i>Brasile</i>, to <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Sea-Coast from <i>Chili</i> to <i>Magellanica</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Concerning the Sea-Coast, which extends from <i>Chili</i> to <i>Magellanica</i>, it is as followeth:
Next to the Promontory <i>Felis</i> lie <i>Cypriaen</i>, <i>Clara</i>, <i>Cabo de las Islas</i>, the Island
<i>Socora</i>, the Haven <i>Domingo</i>, the Point <i>Gallego</i>, the Road <i>Stevan</i>, the Cape <i>Andres</i>, and
<i>Ochavario</i>, and the Valley <i>Nuestra Sennora</i>, between two Hills. Along the Southern
Ocean lie <i>Abra de San Guillen</i>, <i>Punta del Gada</i>, <i>Los Reyes</i>, <i>Innocentes</i>, <i>Augustine</i>, <i>Roia</i>, <i>Catalina</i>,
<i>Amaro</i>, and <i>Victoriano</i>; before which the three Isles call’d <i>The Sorlings</i>, are seen
in the Mouth of the <i>Straights</i> against the South Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Magaglianus</i> Steering hither, Winter’d within the <i>Straights</i> in an Inlet call’d <i>St. Julian</i>,
stay’d two Moneths before the Mouth of the River <i>Santa Cruiz</i>, where he took
abundance of Fish, and from thence ran along the Shore to the Promontory <i>Las
Virgines</i>, which receiv’d that Denomination, because it was discover’d on the Day
Consecrated to <i>St. Ursula</i> and her eleven thousand <i>Virgins</i>: Going a League up into
the Countrey, he found a Hut, in which above two hundred dead Bodies were bury’d
after a strange manner, and on the Shore a great Whale, driven on the Sands by a
Storm. He nam’d the Countrey to the Southward, <i>Terra del Fuego</i>, because from the
Promontory <i>Severino</i> in the Night he espy’d several Fires. He was exceedingly delighted
with the pleasant Coasts on each side of the <i>Straights</i>, which were the more
pleasant, by reason of several Hills overgrown with sweet-smelling Trees, whose
tops lay cover’d with Snow.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Expedition of <i>Garcias Loaysa</i>, <i>Alcazova</i>, and others.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_649'>649</span><i>Magaglianus</i> was follow’d, <i>Anno 1525.</i> by <i>Garcias Loaysa</i>, who Sailing into the
<i>Straights</i> near the Promontory <i>Virgines</i>, endur’d great Colds; in the Haven <i>St.
George</i> he found store of green Cinamon: The People he reported to be of
so monstrous a stature, that they might well be accounted Giants; some of
whom went naked, others wore a Net of Feathers made fast about their Wastes,
and others a loose Garment all over their Bodies. <i>Loaysa</i> gave this Countrey,
inhabited by Giants, the Denomination of <i>Terra del Patagoni</i>. He judg’d the
<i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i> to be a hundred and ten <i>Spanish</i> Miles long between the two
Promontories, <i>Virgines</i> at the North Sea, and <i>Deseado</i> at the Southern Ocean.
Within lie three Inlets, which have seven Leagues in breadth.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Simon Alcazova</i> Sailing hither nine years after <i>Loaysa</i>, shunn’d the Land on the
left-side of the <i>Straights</i>, because it lay most under Water, and was forc’d by his
Men to return to the Haven <i>Leones</i>, where he and all his Seamen were put to
death.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not long after the Bishop of <i>Placentia</i> fitted out three Sail, which entring the
<i>Straights</i>, Anno 1540. lost their Admiral; the Vice-Admiral Wintering at the Inlet
<i>Las Zorras</i>, (so call’d, because they took many Foxes on a Champain Countrey
without Trees) return’d to <i>Spain</i> without any farther success: the third Ship with
much ado arriv’d also at <i>Arequipa</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Voyages of <i>Hawkins</i>, <i>Drake</i>, and <i>Candish</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>English</i> Captain, <i>Richard Hawkins</i>, also Sailing hither, found the Land on
the South side of the <i>Straights</i>, most broken, and in some places a few Huts.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Anno 1578.</i> Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> Sailing hither along the Coast of <i>Brasile</i>, Landing
on an Island in the Mouth of the <i>Straights</i>, kill’d above three thousand Birds. Sailing
from hence he was miserably toss’d in the South Sea, and discover’d about the
middle of the <i>Straights</i>, that the Current out of the Southern and Northern Ocean
met at the place where a great Bay bends Southwardly: To three Isles he gave
the Name of <i>Elizabeth</i>, <i>Bartholomew</i>, and <i>George</i>, and drove three Weeks without
making any Sail, in snowy, misty, and rainy Weather, falling amongst dangerous
Rocks, and at last Anchor’d in the Haven <i>Health</i>, which he so call’d, because his sick
and wearied Men being refresh’d there, he set Sail from thence and return’d home.</p>

<p class='c010'>Captain <i>Thomas Candish</i> following Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> eight years after, found near
a Creek within the City <i>Philip-stadt</i>, built there by the <i>Spaniards</i>, to secure the Passage
out of the Northern to the Southern Ocean for themselves; to which purpose
they held four hundred Men in Garrison in the said City, which lying near a pleasant
Wood, was defended by four Bulwarks, each fortifi’d with a Brass Gun: But
the <i>Spaniards</i> not being able to endure the Cold, nor get in their Harvest, which
was continually spoil’d by the Natives, were so pinch’d with Hunger, that after
three years stay many of them dy’d in their Houses, which caus’d a filthy Stink,
and consequently a vile Distemper, not unlike the Small-pox; at last twenty three
of them, amongst whom were two Women, judg’d it convenient to bury their
great Guns, and march away with their Musquets; a whole Year they travell’d in
great want, feeding on the Leaves of Trees, wild Roots, and Fowls which they
now and then kill’d; at last they resolv’d to travel by Land to <i>Rio de la Plata</i>, but
never any news was heard what became of them, onely one <i>Spaniard</i>, call’d <i>Ferdinand</i>,
being stray’d from the rest, was taken by <i>Candish</i>, to whom he gave the foremention’d
Relation. <i>Candish</i> entring <i>Philip-stadt</i>, found a Gibbet, on which hung a
Malefactor in Chains, a Church, the Houses full of famish’d Bodies, and four
Brass Guns, which he digg’d out of the Ground. From hence he ran to a fresh-water
River (which disembogues into the <i>Straights</i>,) whose Banks are inhabited by
cruel Cannibals, and the Countrey all about plain Pasture Grounds, whereas most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_650'>650</span>part of the Shore in the <i>Straights</i> is very mountainous. <i>Candish</i> Landing, found
<i>Spanish</i> Knives and Stilletto’s amongst the Man-eaters, and lay a whole Moneth at
Anchor in the western Mouth of <i>Magellanica</i>, by reason of great Storms, feeding on
Mussles, Cockles, and Fowl; and from thence Sail’d about the World, returning
home at last with a Booty of twenty Tun of Gold.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Anno 1599.</i> <i>Simon de Cordes</i> Commanding five <i>Netherland</i> Vessels, entring the
<i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>, found in the green Bay, Mussles of a Span long, abundance of
Ducks and Geese, and a great many Trees not unlike Laurel, they being onely
bigger, and had a sharp biting Shell. The Wind blew exceeding hard here over
the Rocks, insomuch that they were sometimes driven from four Anchors.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Bird <i>Pinguyn</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>A few Moneths after <i>Oliver van Noord</i> follow’d <i>Cordes</i>, and Anchor’d near the
<i>Pinguyn</i> Isles, the biggest whereof is call’d <i>Castemme</i>, and the least <i>Talke</i>; the Inhabitants
thereof dwell in Caverns under Ground, and feed on the Birds <i>Pinguyns</i>, of
whose Skins they make Mantles. These Birds weigh generally fifteen or sixteen
Pound, have black Backs, white Bellies, very thick Skins, long Bills like Ravens,
short thick Necks, two plum’d Fins in stead of Wings, black Feet like a Goose, and
delicate Flesh, notwithstanding they feed on Fish, after which they swim very
swift with the fore-mention’d Fins, which hang down on each side along their Bodies
when they walk upright on the Shore; they sit generally four together in their
Holes, made after such a manner, that a Man which knows not of them, may ere
he be aware, sink up to the Knees in the same, and be bitten terribly by the Legs.
<i>Cordes</i> his Seamen got in two hours time above nine hundred of these Birds, whilest
he discover’d the salvage People <i>Enoo</i>, which inhabit the Countrey <i>Cossi</i>, and are divided
into the Families <i>Kemenetes</i>, <i>Kennekas</i>, and <i>Caraike</i>; the first inhabited the
Territory <i>Carray</i>; the second <i>Caramay</i>; and the third, <i>Morine</i>: all of them Paint
their Cheeks and Forehead. Farther into the Countrey dwell the <i>Trimenes</i>, a gigantick
sort of People, eleven Foot high, who maintain continual Wars with their
Neighbors.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Great Discoveries of the <i>Netherlanders</i> about the <i>Magellan Straights</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, <i>Noord</i> discover’d several Inlets full of Ice and fresh Water in the
<i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>, whither the <i>United Netherlands</i> have since sent the Admirals
<i>William Schouten</i>, <i>Joris Spilbergen</i>, and <i>Jaques le Heremite</i>. The common opinion, that
the Countrey on the South side of <i>Magellan</i> is of the Main Continent, Experience
hath manifested; for <i>Schouten</i> found the same, <i>Anno 1616.</i> who Sailing from <i>Porto
Desire</i>, left the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i> on the right-hand, and Sail’d Southerly through
whitish Water, and in fifty four Degrees discover’d a Channel eight Leagues
broad, through which ran a strong Current. The Coast rose with high Mountains,
whose tops were cover’d with Snow. The utmost Point was call’d <i>Mauritius</i>,
from the Prince of <i>Orange</i>; the broken Coast on the other side, <i>The States-Island</i>;
and the <i>Straights</i> it self, <i>Le Maire</i>, upon the Request of the Merchant <i>Jacob Le Maire</i>,
whose Father <i>Isaac</i> was chief owner of the two Ships of which <i>Schouten</i> was Commander,
who found so many Whales here, that he could scarce Steer clear of them,
they swimming by hundreds in a Shoal. The Sea-pies, much bigger than Swans,
suffer’d themselves to be caught by the Hands of the Sea-men. Moreover he call’d
the barren grey Rocks, and others lesser, lying North-East from the Promontory
<i>Hoorn</i>, <i>Barnevields Isles</i>. Sailing beyond the Point <i>Hoorn</i>, he was toss’d by the vast
Billows that came rowling out of the West.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was no sooner nois’d abroad, that the <i>Netherlanders</i> had found the Straights
<i>Le Maire</i>, but the <i>Spanish</i> King <i>Philip</i> immediately sent two Carvels thither, under
the Command of <i>Garcias de Nodal</i>, who took an exact Account of the Heads, Roads,
and Inlets belonging to the fore-mention’d <i>Straights</i>, and return’d without performing
any other Exploits.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Diego Flores</i> his unsuccessful Voyage to the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Diego Flores</i> Steer’d four years before <i>Candish</i> to the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i> with
twenty three Sail of Ships, Mann’d with three thousand five hundred Seamen,
besides five hundred old <i>Netherland</i> Soldiers, with which he unhappily weigh’d Anchor
from <i>Cales</i>; for before he got out of sight of the <i>Spanish</i> Coast, he lost five
of his Ships and eight hundred Men; yet prosecuting his Voyage, he stay’d during
the Winter Season on the Coast of <i>Brasile</i> and was surpris’d by so vehement a
Storm, near the Island <i>Catalina</i>, that a company of Women, sent under the Charge
of <i>Peter Sarmiento</i> to Settle in the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>, were all cast away, with the
greatest part of the Ammunition and Provisions. The <i>English</i> Admiral <i>Fenton</i>
took three Ships of this Fleet from <i>Flores</i>, two were cast away in the River <i>La Plata</i>,
and one ran back to <i>Spain</i>, whilest <i>Flores</i> came into the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i> on the
last day of <i>March</i>, at which time the whole Countrey lay cover’d with Snow;
wherefore seeing no hopes of finding out any place to Settle <i>Sarmiento</i> upon, he
stood back with eight Sail to <i>Brasile</i>, and in his Return burnt three <i>French</i> Ships,
took two more, and Sail’d home. But his Lieutenant <i>Diego Ribera</i>, and the Governor
<i>Peter Sarmiento</i>, Landed the Year after <i>Flores</i> his departure, with four hundred
Men, thirty Women, and Provisions for eight Moneths, in the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>;
from whence <i>Ribera</i> Sail’d back, whilest <i>Sarmiento</i> built on the North side of the
Mouth of the <i>Straights</i>, the Town <i>Nombre de Jesus</i>; and fifty Leagues farther in the
narrowest place, <i>Philip-stadt</i>, with four Bulwarks; the Inhabitants of which (as is
before related) were destroy’d by Famine.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of <i>Terra del Fuego</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Terra del Fuego</i>, already mention’d, opposite to the Countrey of the <i>Patagones</i>, lying
the South between the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>, is a broken Countrey, with high
Mountains full of Trees, and wash’d by pleasant Rivulets: four Foot deep in the
Ground it begins to be all Rocky. The Air is troubled with exceeding great
Winds out of the West. The Inhabitants are pale Countenanc’d, but Paint their
Bodies with divers Colours; they have long, thick, and black Hair, and very sharp
Teeth; the Men go stark naked; the Women cover their secret Parts with a piece
of Leather, and wear Strings full of Shells about their Necks; some also Mantle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_652'>652</span>themselves with the Skins of wild Beasts, which affords but little warmth against
the Cold that is here in Winter. Their Huts consist of Trees, and are made round
at bottom, and sharp on the top like a Tent, having onely a Hole for the Smoak
to go out at; they are digg’d three Foot deep into the Ground, and also heap’d
round with Earth; within the Huts nothing is to be found but Baskets with Fishing
Utensils and Stone Hooks. Their offensive Arms the Men always carry about
with them, because they always maintain Wars with their Neighbors. They handle
a Quarter-staff very dexterously, are good Slingers and Bowemen; they also
use Lances with sharp Stone Points. Moreover they make Boats of the Bark of
Trees, which they first cut out into a Form, then sewing it together, bow the
same after the manner of a Boat, which rises before and behind, and being fifteen
or sixteen Foot long, can carry eight Men, going exceeding swift. These People
are not onely beastial in their Practices, but also Murderers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, besides the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Le Maire</i>, <i>Henrick Brewer</i> hath found a new Passage
to the Eastward above the <i>States-Island</i>, out of the Northern Ocean to the
South Sea.</p>

<h3 id='c653' class='c001'>CHAP. IV.<br /> The unknown South-Land.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>The unknown <i>South-Land</i> extends with several Points to the Southern
Ocean, which have been more seen than discover’d by divers Nations.</p>

<p class='c010'>Opposite to the <i>East-India</i> Island <i>Gilolo</i>, lies <i>Terra des Papous</i>, to which
<i>Jacob Le Maire</i> gave the Denomination of <i>New Guinee</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>English</i> Commander, <i>Richard Hawkins</i>, Sailing to the Southward behind
<i>Papou</i>, found the Inhabitants black like <i>Negro</i>’s: round about appear several Isles
and convenient Harbors. <i>Herrera</i> places here on the East, the Countrey <i>Agnanda</i>,
the Road <i>St. Jago</i>, the Island <i>Los Crespos</i>, the Haven <i>Andreas</i>, the River <i>Virginum</i>, and
the little Isle <i>La Vellena</i>, before the Mouth of the Stream <i>Augustine</i>. Next you meet
Easterly with the Rivers <i>St. Peter</i> and <i>St. Paul</i>, the Havens <i>Hieronymus</i>, the Isles <i>Punta
Salida</i>, <i>Abrigo</i>, <i>Malagente</i>, and <i>Maure de Dios</i>, inhabited by white People.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Discoveries in <i>Terra Australis incognita</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The first that discover’d <i>New Guinee</i>, Anno 1529. was <i>Alvares de Savedra</i>, who,
as also several others besides him, suppos’d that some of the Islands <i>Solomons</i> border
<i>New Guinee</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eighteen of the many <i>Solomon</i> Isles exceed the rest, of which some are three hundred
Leagues in circumference, some two hundred, others one hundred, and some
fifty: All that are inhabited have a fruitful Soil, producing all manner of Provisions,
particularly Hogs and Poultrey. The Natives differ very much one from
another, for some are black, others white or tawny.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fore-mention’d <i>Hawkins</i> in his Voyage towards the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i>,
supposing it by estimation to be fifty Leagues from the Main Coast of <i>America</i>, discover’d
forty Degrees to the Southward of the <i>Equinoctial Line</i>, with a Westerly
Wind, the unknown <i>South-Land</i>; which he found to consist of low Land, and to
be inhabited, by reason of the many Fires which he saw ashore in the Night.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Spanish</i> Commander, <i>Peter Fernandes de Quiro</i>, and the Admiral <i>Lodowick Paes
de Torres</i>, have made a farther Discovery of this Countrey; for Landing on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_653'>653</span><i>South-Land</i>, they met with several People, some whereof were brown, others
white, and others sallow; some had long and lank, others short and curl’d Hair:
They acknowledg’d no King or supream Governor, nor were Govern’d by any
Laws, neither had they any Wall’d Towns or Forts; but being divided amongst
themselves, they continually Encountred one another with Darts, Clubs, and
Staves. Their Houses built of Wood, were cover’d with the Leaves of Palm-Trees.
Their Housholdstuff consisted in Earthen Dishes, Pots, Ropes, Fish-nets,
Flutes, Drums, and varnish’d Spoons. Their Gardens were neatly kept. Near
their Temples were Burying-places. They Row’d very swift in little Boats. Their
Bread, well tasted, was made of long thick Roots, either roasted or boyl’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fertility, Plenty, and Riches of the Countrey.</div>

<p class='c010'>Here also grow sorts of <i>Platano</i>’s, great abundance of Almonds, Oranges,
Citrons, thick Sugar-Canes, Palm-Trees, which yield Wine, <i>Cocoa</i>’s, and <i>Obos</i>, in
taste not much unlike Quinces; but the greatest benefit which they receive, is from
the <i>Cocoa</i> Nuts, the Pulp whereof is delicious Meat and Drink; the outermost Shells
whereof serve for Cups or Dishes, the inner for Ropes and Cordage; of the
Leaves they make Sails and Mats, and cover their Houses with the same; of the
Body, Oars, Clubs, Pikes, and Props for their Houses.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides several sorts of Pot-herbs, here grow very high Coleworts and <i>Bledo</i>’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Countrey also abounds with Pigeons, Partridges, Ducks, Goats, Hogs,
and other ordinary Cattel and Fowls.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Rivers afford them Souls, Salmon, Thornback, Sea-Cocks, Eels, Gurnets,
and several other unknown Fishes, very delicate and wholsom.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey also produces Nutmegs, Mastick, Peppers, Ginger, Cinamon,
Gold, Silver, Pearls, Silk, Sugar, Anniseed, Honey, Wax, Ebony-wood, Turpentine,
Lime-pits, and Marble.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Philips-Bay</i> bends twenty Leagues into the Countrey, hath a safe Harbor, and
excellent Ground, consisting of black Sand. Two great Rivers discharge their
Waters into the said Bay, round about which are pleasant Woods, full of Quails,
Parrakito’s, Parrots, Nightingales, and Bulfinches, which Sing very sweetly. The
Blossoms, especially of Orange-Trees, and the Herb <i>Alvaca</i>, yield an odoriferous
smell. The wholsom Air adds vigor to aged People.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Abel Tasman</i>’s Expedition to <i>Terra Australis Incognita</i>.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Southlander’s desperate Attempt upon Tasman’s Ships.</i></div>

<p class='c010'><i>Fernandes de Quir</i> delivering the fore-mention’d Account to <i>Philip</i> the Second,
King of <i>Spain</i>, mov’d him to Plant the unknown <i>South-Land</i>, and the rather, because
he had not found any snowy Mountains, drown’d Land, Crocodiles, <i>Muschito</i>’s,
or any hurtful Creature, yet was not regarded; so that no <i>Spaniard</i> hath
since that time set Foot on the unknown <i>South-Land</i>. But the <i>East-India</i> Company
undertaking the Design with great eagerness, sent thither two Ships, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Hemskerk</i>
and <i>Sea-Cock</i>, under the Command of <i>Abel Tasman</i>, to make a farther Discovery
of the said <i>South-Land</i>: <i>Anno 1642.</i> on the twelfth of <i>August</i>, they weigh’d
Anchor from <i>Batavia</i>, Sail’d through the <i>Straights</i> of <i>Sunda</i> to <i>Maurice-Island</i>, where
they Anchor’d in the North-West Haven before the Castle <i>Frederick-Henrick</i>, on the
fifth of <i>September</i> in the fore-mention’d Year. On the eighth of <i>Octob.</i> <i>Tasman</i>
stood over to the <i>South-Land</i>, near which he was surpris’d by a violent Storm; afterwards,
on the twenty fifth of <i>November</i>, he discover’d a barren Shore, against
which the Sea beat very furiously; and Steering along this Coast, he found a convenient
Inlet, but was forc’d by the hard Weather to stand off to Sea again; yet
not long after approaching the Shore, he saw great hollow Trees, and round about
them abundance of Mussle-shells, and from the Wood heard a shrill noise of People
Singing: Going to the same place again, he put the Orange Flag on a Pole,
Carv’d with the <i>East-India</i> Companies Arms, and call’d the Inlet <i>Frederick-Henrick</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_654'>654</span>the whole Coast, <i>Anthony van Diemen</i>. Sailing from thence Eastward, he on the
eighteenth of <i>December</i> discovered a convenient Haven, where sending his Sloop to
discover the Shore, he came back in the Evening, being follow’d by a Boat, which
approach’d nearer and nearer, but Night coming upon him, he could not well
discern what they were that pursu’d him, but heard the cry of hoarse Voices, and
a shrill noise like that of a Trumpet, which the <i>Netherland</i> Seamen answer’d by
hollowing, and blowing on their Trumpets, and at last firing a Gun, the <i>Southlanders</i>
made a hideous noise, and blowing their Horns, return’d ashore. <i>Tasman</i>
hereupon call’d his Watch, laid Hangers, Pikes, and Musquets ready Charg’d, upon
the Decks. The next day the <i>Southlanders</i> came in several Boats, two and two
ty’d together, and cover’d with Planks, towards the Ships; the Gunner of the
<i>Hemskerk</i> going with six Men in a Boat to help mount some Guns in the <i>Sea-Cock</i>,
were betwixt both Ships set upon by the <i>Southlanders</i>, who approacht with a hideous
noise, kill’d four of the <i>Hollanders</i> with long Poles, and forc’d the other three to
save themselves by swimming; which they had no sooner done, but they Row’d
with incredible swiftness towards the Shore, insomuch that they were out of the
reach of their Guns before they could make ready to fire at them. <i>Tasman</i> finding
that there was no good to be done here, since he hazarded the Lives of his Seamen
against a company of wild People, he set Sail, but was follow’d by divers Boats,
at which he fir’d his After-Guns with pieces of Iron and Stones, which killing some
of them, made the rest return. In the midst of the Boats, which were ty’d two and
two together, sat the Commander, who encourag’d the Rowers; they all us’d
Clubs without Points.</p>

<p class='c010'>These People were gross of Body, undaunted, strong, and of a tawny colour;
the Hair of their Heads stroak’d up round, was ty’d up on their Crown, on which
stuck a stiff white Feather; about their Necks hung a square Plate; they wore in
stead of Cloaks, square pieces of Cloth, made fast before on their Breasts.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Tasman</i>, by reason of his rough Entertainment call’d this Harbor, <i>Murderers-Bay</i>,
and afterwards Sail’d along the Shore till the fifth of <i>January 1643.</i> on which Day
he dropt Anchor near a little Rocky Island, from which fell two Streams, with a
great noise into the Sea. The Inhabitants, a strong People, beckned to the Seamen
to come on Shore; some lean’d on thick Clubs, others Fenc’d one with another. <i>Tasman</i>
sending his Sloop ashore for Water with two Drakes, return’d without any,
not being able to Land, by reason of the hollow Sea near the Shore; wherefore
Sailing from thence he discover’d two low Isles, which were full of Woods of very
tall Trees; from the biggest whereof came a little Boat, sharp before and behind,
in which three sallow Men, sitting behind one another, Row’d with great swiftness
towards the <i>Hemskerk</i>; whereupon <i>Tasman</i> commanded all his Men to go under
the Hatches, that the three <i>Southlanders</i> might not be afraid to come aboard;
he also threw a piece of Linnen out of his Cabbin Window, which one of them,
leaping into the Sea, took up, and as a sign of thankfulness, laid the same on his
Head, and being hereby emboldned, they came nearer the Rudder, where they took
up a Knife, ty’d to a piece of Wood, out of the Water, and return’d the Seamen
a Fishhook of Mother-of-Pearl, ty’d to a Cotton Line. Approaching the Shore,
they saw abundance of People running along, with two little Flags on Sticks.
Some of the Natives came in their Boats close up with <i>Tasman</i>’s Ship; and one more
bold than the rest entring the same, was found to be a tall Man with a broad
black Beard, and green Leaves about his Neck, who sat down on the Deck with
his Legs under him, and bow’d down his Head oftentimes very low: <i>Tasman</i> returning
his Civility, took him by the Hand to Treat him in his Cabbin, but a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_655'>655</span>Dog which was in the Ship Barking, he grew fearful, and went into his Boat
again. Several other <i>Southlanders</i> swam aboard, and others brought <i>Pisang</i> and
<i>Clappes</i> in their Boats. Against the Evening a great Vessel, surrounded with lesser
Boats, came Rowing towards the <i>Hemskerk</i>, the Men making a great noise; the
Seamen fearing some Design, ran all to their Arms, but were convinc’d of their
Friendship by the Gifts they Presented them with from the Governor of the Island.
The next day a strange Boat came near the <i>Sea-Cock</i>, <i>viz.</i> two Sloops, which
being ty’d together, and cover’d with Boards, carry’d several Men, Commanded
by a Captain, by them call’d <i>Orangkay</i>: On the midst of the Boards which cover’d
the two Boats, stood a Hut made of Rushes, and cover’d over with <i>Pisang</i>
Leaves; the Sails being made of Mats, caus’d it to Sail very swiftly. Round
about this Sloop Row’d lesser Boats, out of which loud Acclamations were heard,
every one crying out, <i>Hael, Hael</i>: during which noise, those <i>Southlanders</i> which
were already come aboard, sat still on the Decks, which made <i>Tasman</i> think that
their King himself was coming to give him a Visit, which accordingly fell out,
for he came and Presented him with several Hogs, Poultrey, <i>Clappes</i> and <i>Pisang</i>,
all cover’d with white Cloths.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Interview between <i>Tasman</i> and the <i>Southlander</i> King.</div>

<p class='c010'>This  <i>Southlandish</i> King was Habited in a Suit, the Stuff whereof resembled <i>Chinese</i>
Paper, doubled and pasted together, and was attended by a great Train of
Men, Women, and Children, all of them as black as a Coal; some of them swam
after, and others follow’d him in Boats.</p>

<p class='c010'>These <i>Southlanders</i> barter’d their Clothes and Necklaces, which consisted of
Mother-of-Pearl and white Cockles, and Fishhooks made also of Mother-of-Pearl,
against Nails, Knives, and the like Trifles.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Tasman</i> caus’d a Shirt, Breeches, Doublet, and Hat, to be put on an old <i>Orangkay</i>;
who being thus Cloth’d, stood a considerable time admiring of himself, and
was also much wonder’d at by his Subjects; but going into the Countrey, he
came back without his Clothes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another <i>Orangkay</i> being Presented with a Rummer of Wine, pour’d out the
Wine, and setting the Rummer on his Head, went away with great joy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some of the Governors view’d the Ships, not onely above, but also below the
Decks, and being brought to the Guns, they desir’d to know the use of them;
whereupon one being Discharg’d, it so affrighted them, that had they not been
held, they had all leap’d overboard.</p>

<p class='c010'>Provisions were daily brought by the <i>Southlanders</i> to the <i>Hollanders</i> in great Vessels,
surrounded by many lesser; still as they put their Oars into the Water, they
made a hideous noise.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Tasman</i> bringing some empty Vessels upon the Deck, thereby to make them understand
that he wanted fresh Water, the <i>Orangkays</i> pointed to the Shore; whither
they went with two Boats, which return’d without Water, the Inhabitants themselves
being forc’d to dig Pits to get the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mean while other <i>Southlanders</i> coming aboard, the Pilot and Boatswain’s Boy
blow’d on their Trumpets, another play’d on a Flute, and a fourth on a Violin,
whilst some of the Seamen Dancing, so amaz’d the Natives, that they stood
like senseless Creature, gaping with open Mouth upon them.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Tasman</i> looking into a Grammar which contain’d the Language of the <i>Solomons</i>
Isles, found that many words which were us’d by these People, had a great similitude
with those of that Language.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides these Men, there came likewise a great many Women aboard, all of
them extraordinary tall, especially two, who might justly be stil’d Giantesses;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_656'>656</span>one whereof had Mustacho’s; both ran, and embracing the Chirurgeon <i>Henrick
Haelbos</i>, desir’d carnal Copulation with him, and seem’d to quarrel one with another
about him: Others confidently put their Hands into the <i>Hollanders</i> Breeches,
their Husbands giving consent thereunto: All of them had thick, curl’d, black
Hair, which they colour’d red, and comb’d with ten little round Sticks ty’d together
on the top, and left wide like Teeth at the bottom; yet some of them let
their Hair hang down in long braided Locks; they shave their upper Lips, but
keep a square Beard on their Chin; yet amongst the old People there were
some whose Cheeks were overgrown with Hair: Their manner of shaving is with
the Teeth of certain Fish made fast to a Stick; they all went bare-headed, except
some few, who ty’d a square piece of Stuff, wrought of Leaves or Feathers, above
their Eyes against the Sun; the upper parts of their Bodies were all naked, but
about their Middle some wore a Girdle, others a Mat of <i>Clappes</i> Leaves, others a
Cloth not unlike <i>Chinese</i> Paper, about the lower parts of their Bodies. The Womens
Apparel differ’d little from the Mens, excepting that their Aprons reach’d
farther down, <i>viz.</i> to their Knees. They barter’d their Clothes against Nails. Some
of the <i>Orangkays</i>, being Entertain’d in the Cabbin, wonder’d to see a Bullet that
was Discharg’d from the Quarter deck, fall into the Water at so great a distance.
They wore about their Necks Mother-of-Pearl, white Cockles, sweet-smelling
Flowers, green Leaves, or the Nails which they had gotten of the <i>Hollanders</i>: Some
of the aged Women wanted both their little Fingers, and the young ones the upper
Joints of them, which the old Men also wanted: <i>Haelbos</i> pointing at the Stump,
ask’d the reason of it, but one of them laying his Hand under his Chin, made strange
Signs, out of which he could apprehend nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the twenty third of <i>January</i>, a second time <i>Tasman</i> went ashore for Water,
carrying Spades and Pick-axes with him, to dig Pits with. Two of the <i>Hollanders</i>
Boats going close together, in each of which were three <i>Southlanders</i>, <i>Tasman</i> call’d
to his Rowers to pull stoutly; which the <i>Southlanders</i> in <i>Tasman</i>’s Boat observing to
tend to their Rowing the swifter, laugh’d and hooted at their Countrey-men that
were in the <i>Sea-Cocks</i> Boat, when they chanc’d to get beyond them. <i>Tasman</i> in his
going ashore discover’d several Isles at a distance, was kindly Entertain’d, and
towards the Evening carry’d by four Men through the Water, on a Mat made fast
betwixt two Poles, to his Sloop, whither they also brought nine Hogs, and fresh
Water digg’d out of Pits.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Tasman</i> being got about the Point of the Island, saw the <i>Hemskerk</i> under Sail;
wherefore Rowing aboard the <i>Sea-Cock</i>, he was inform’d that she had slipt her Anchor;
whereupon following her, he got sight of another green Island the next day,
along the Shore whereof ran several People with Sticks, on which hung white
Cloths: some of them came aboard, and brought with them what Provisions the
Island afforded. The Inhabitants barter’d <i>Clappes</i>, <i>Pisang</i>, Fowls, Hogs, Mother-of-Pearl
Fish-hooks, Stone Axes, little Stools, great Clubs, with a black Point as
long as a Man’s Arm, and hooked, against Trifles. The <i>Hollanders</i> were also stor’d
here with fresh Water. The People both in Language, Habit, and Customs, were
very like those of the first Island, but were not altogether so courteous. One of
the <i>Southlanders</i> stealing a Half-pike out of the Boat was forc’d by his Companions
to restore the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fore-mention’d <i>Haelbos</i> relates, That going ashore with some Soldiers, he
saw their Houses, which he found to be built after a strange manner, <i>viz.</i> some of
them were round like Towers, Wider at top than at bottom, and without any
Holes for Air, but all built close of Canes, which were stuck in the Ground; other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_657'>657</span>Huts were cover’d with a long Roof of <i>Pisang</i> or <i>Clappes</i> Leaves, resting on Posts;
under which kind of Building <i>Haelbos</i> shelter’d himself against a mighty Shower
of Rain, found divers young Men and Women sitting on Mats, and an old Woman,
blind through Age, lying by them on the Ground, and Fanning her self with <i>Pisang</i>
Leaves: The Men going away, signifi’d thereby a kind of Invitation to the
<i>Hollanders</i> to go to the Women, who not receiving the Entertainment they expected,
rose altogether on a sudden, and Singing, Danc’d about the <i>Hollanders</i>.
The Men had on their Shoulders and Breasts, Scars of half an Inch deep, and an
Inch long; upon some of which, being fresh and bleeding, the Flyes sat. They
eat after a strange manner, for stripping off the outmost Rinds of the <i>Clappes</i> with
their Teeth, and breaking the hard Shell against their Elbows, they pull out the
Kernel, and eat the same. Whatever Flesh-meat they eat, they never throughly
boyl or roast it, but make it onely just warm. They sleep on the Ground upon
Mats, and lay their Heads on a little woodden Cricket with four Feet. They take
great pride in their Hair, and those that have not long Hair of their own, use
Perukes.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Tasman</i> steering his Course towards the high Coast that lay before this Island,
was follow’d by several small Vessels from the adjacent Shore, of which some carry’d
a Bough of <i>Clappes</i> or <i>Pisang</i>, with white Veins at the ends; but seeing the
Ships Sail from them, they threw the same overboard. <i>Tasman</i> standing Westerly,
discover’d three Isles, near the last whereof the Sea broke exceedingly, which the
<i>Hollanders</i> not without great danger had approached in the Night: after which
they discover’d to Leeward of them, a high Coast, which extended it self a great
way, but the Sea went so rough, that they durst not venture near the Land; besides,
the Sea went very high on a Bank, first ten, then five, three and a half, and
again ten, fourteen, and seven Fathom deep; and oftentimes a Man might see the
Ground, insomuch that they kept out the Boats belonging to the <i>Hemskerk</i>, which
was in most danger, to carry them aboard of the <i>Sea-Cock</i>, if the first should chance
to split. Lastly, getting over the Bank, they saw very high Land to Windward, and
many hilly Isles to Leeward; the Sea also was full of blind Rocks and Shelves, so
that they were in danger every hour, and the rather, because the Wind blew hard
every day; yet at last losing sight of Land, they steer’d their Course Westerly
in five Degrees Southward of the <i>Line</i>, towards <i>New Guinee</i>. On the two and
twentieth of <i>March</i> they discover’d low Land full of Woods of tall Trees, surrounded
with a company of Isles, against some of which the Sea brake with great
violence, insomuch that they were again in great danger, especially when they
were got amongst eighteen Isles, between which the Water being shallow, and the
Current running very strongly, drove the Ships towards the Shore: Whilest they
were Tacking to and again to get beyond the Shelves, a little Vessel, carrying a great
Weathercock on her Star-board, came from the Shore, Row’d by seven Men, who
sat on Boards which lay over the same; they were of a brown Complexion, onely
girt about with a hairy Girdle, made fast on the top of their Heads; under their
Feet they also wore something in stead of Shoes, about their Necks hung Flowers,
and their Bodies were Painted black: Among the seven, one who was very fat,
and whose Head was adorn’d with two Feathers, stood up and proffer’d the
Seamen two <i>Clappes</i>, in return whereof <i>Tasman</i> gave them a Box of Nails and a
piece of Sail-cloth, which sinking under Water, an aged Man div’d for the same,
and bringing it up, gave it to his six Companions, who made no shew of thankfulness.
Their Arms consisted in Bowes and Arrows. Their <i>Clappes</i> they call’d
<i>Anieuw</i>, as the other Islanders had done.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_658'>658</span>Sailing from hence, they discover’d two low Islands full of Trees; and three
Leagues from them, on their Star-board, a high Coast, and on the other side a great
Island, whither they drove with a small Gale; approaching the same, two very
small Boats came towards the <i>Hemskerk</i>; the biggest of the two carry’d six Men,
and the least three, all of them very deform’d; they went stark naked, onely their
Yards were ty’d up with a String on their Bellies, and about their Arms hung
Chains of Mother-of-Pearl; they were Coal-black, onely red about the Mouth,
which redness was occasion’d by the chewing of <i>Pisang</i>; in their Hair stuck woodden
Combs, and on their Foreheads green Leaves; but in each Boat was one who
had a bruised Reed made fast in his Neck like a Plume; the biggest Vessel was
Painted with strange Shapes of Men and Beasts; they us’d red Bowes and Arrows,
and having call’d to the Seamen, they Row’d back again to the Shore; which
<i>Tasman</i> left a Stern of him, and ran between the Main Coast (by all suppos’d to be
<i>New Guinee</i>) and several great Islands, that lay scatter’d along before the Main
Coast; from whence came four small Boats, adorn’d with Imagery like Serpents,
but kept without Gun-shot from the Ships; at last one leaping overboard, swam to
the smallest Boat, out of which one swam back in his stead to the other, and afterwards
came to the <i>Hemskerks</i> side; he was a black Man, wore Leaves before his
Privities, and Armlets about his Elbows; through the Gristle of his Nose stuck a
white Bone Bodkin, sharp at the ends, and of a Fingers length, and about his
Neck a String full of Cockle-shells.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Tasman</i> Sailing on along the Main Coast, met with eighteen Boats more, the
Rowers whereof laid their Oars upon their Heads, and not without strange Gestures
call’d aloud, and invited the <i>Hollanders</i> to come ashore: On the Sterns and
Heads of these Boats were likewise divers Shapes Painted, upon a white Ground;
in some were two, and in others three, four, and five Men; eight of them going
into the <i>Hollanders</i> Boats, were made Drunk with <i>Arrack</i>. These <i>Southlanders</i> went
stark naked, some onely covering their secret Parts with Leaves; their Skins were
black, onely on their Foreheads they drew a red Stroke, which reach’d to their
Ears; their brown curl’d Hair was by some colour’d grey, by some red, some let
it hang loose over their Sholdiers, others ty’d the same in a Tuft on their Crown,
cover’d with a Cap of <i>Pisang</i> Leaves, others wore their Hair scarce two Fingers
long, and through the Gristle of their Nose, a piece of Cane or Quill, and a broad
Beard without Mustacho’s; they had nothing to barter but large Snail-shells, on
which they made a strange noise; and whatsoe’re they receiv’d, they first smell’d
on it like Dogs: they fancy’d not Nails, as all the other <i>Southlanders</i> had done.
Their manner of Fishing was thus: They ty’d several half <i>Clappes</i>-shells, made
fast like a Chain, to a long Reed, shook the same to and again on the Water, to gather
the Fish together. In the Boats lay Planks of an oval fashion, which by Ropes
ty’d in the middle they held before them in stead of Shields. When these <i>Southlanders</i>
went from the Ships, one of them threatned to beat the Seamen, shaking his
great Club at them; whereupon they all Row’d with great speed to the Shore,
whilest one in every Boat knockt with a Staff against the sides, just as if they had
beat an Alarm. Amongst them one had barter’d for an old Doublet, with which
he shew’d many antick Tricks, putting it on the wrong way, sometimes on his
Head, then his Feet into the two Arm-holes, and anon the Button-holes behind on
his Back.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Ships Sailing from hence, ran along a broken Coast, and on the twelfth of
<i>April</i> were so terribly shaken by an Earthquake, which lasted an hour and a half,
that they seem’d shivering to pieces in the Water, as if they had ran against a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_659'>659</span>Rock, notwithstanding they could not fathom Ground with their longest Line.
Somewhat farther they discover’d a burning Mountain on an Island, between
which and the Main (on which stood also a very high Mountain) they steering their
Course, came into a white Water, mov’d by a strong River from the Continent;
and coming to an Anchor before the Island <i>Jamna</i>, they saw the Isles <i>Moa</i> and <i>Arimoa</i>
before them. The <i>Jamneans</i> calling <i>New Guinee</i> by the Name of <i>Belah</i>, inform’d
the <i>Hollanders</i>, that they Warr’d continually with the Inhabitants thereof. These
People being also Coal-black, some of them had loose curl’d Hair, hanging down
over their Shoulders in long Braids, and others had onely two thick Locks, which
cover’d their Ears; all of them wore four Feathers on their Heads: the Men pull’d
out their Beards, and hung a great Bone Ring through their Ears, at which also
hung a Shell like a Spur; most of them had red Roses ty’d about their Heads, and
a Necklace of Hogs Teeth about their Necks; under their Navels they wore Girdles,
a handful and a half broad, and about their Wastes Strings full of Shells, or
Sea-Cockles, to which a small Lappet was ty’d, and hung down before their Privities;
but because it was but two Fingers broad, and mov’d to an again by the
Wind, their Nakedness appear’d to those that took notice thereof; through the
Gristle of their Noses they wore a Hogs Tooth, or the Splinter of a Cane. Upon
the Stern of their small Boats was the Shape of a little Lyon. One of these Islanders
imitated the <i>Hollanders</i> when they spoke, endeavoring to repeat their words
after them, and therefore was call’d <i>Parrot</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Tasman</i> Sailing from hence to <i>Moa</i>, came to an Anchor before the Coast, ten
Leagues beyond <i>Jamna</i>, where a great Boat, carrying seventeen Men, coming near
the Ship, let flie a great many Arrows at the Seamen; but the next Morning being
better reconcil’d, they came aboard, where the Chirurgeon of the Ship gave a Cap
to one of the <i>Jamneans</i>, who, as a testimony of his thankfulness for the Present, requested
him to sit down; which done, he began to braid his Hair from his Forehead
to his Neck, tying the same with a String.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Tasman</i> weighing Anchor, Sail’d between <i>New Guinee</i> and the Island <i>Insou</i>, having
got nothing but a few <i>Jamnean</i> words from the Islanders, who call’d a Bone, <i>Vertilia</i>;
a Hog, <i>Paro</i>; a Knife, <i>Sapera</i>; Beads, <i>Sassera</i>; a Nail, <i>Tortor</i>; Sleep, <i>Moeni</i>;
and a Rat, <i>Asphoo</i>. So steering his Course along <i>Arimoa</i>, which is both higher and
larger than the neighboring <i>Amoa</i>, and resembles a Seaman’s Cap, he left <i>New
Guinee</i> a Stern of him, and Steering on Northerly, Sail’d by <i>Schoutes-Island</i>, where
eight large Boats came within Gun-shot of him, each of which had on each side a
Wing, under which sat four Rowers, two and two together, with their Feet hanging
in the Water; at their approaching near the Ship they put out a long Pole,
with a white Flag upon it; whereupon <i>Tasman</i> also commanded his white Ensign
to be put forth, and threw a String of Beads, ty’d to a piece of Wood, out of his
Cabbin Window; which the <i>Southlanders</i> had no sooner taken up, but in testimony
of thankfulness they all broke their Arrows over their Heads, and kept near the
sides of the Ship, till such time as the Boatswain thereof sounded a Trumpet, upon
the hearing of which they all Row’d away with as much speed as they could
possibly. These People were of a sallow Complexion; they broke their Arrows
with great Ceremony; for first they pointed with them towards the Skie, then put
them into the Water, and breaking each Arrow in two pieces on their Heads, they
threw one over the Larboard, and the other over the Starboard; he that broke
the Arrow, made a long Speech to the <i>Hollanders</i>, who took the same for an Oath
of their Fidelity toward them. In every one of these Boats were twenty eight or
thirty Men.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Tasman</i>’s farther Voyage into <i>New Guinee</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_660'>660</span><i>Tasman</i> prosecuting his Voyage farther, discover’d the following day another
Island, and a crooked Arm of <i>New Guinee</i>, near which he judg’d might be an Opening
betwixt <i>New Guinee</i> and <i>Gilolo</i>; then leaving on his Starboard a great many
blind Cliffs, dangerous Shelves, and uneven Grounds, he cast Anchor near a Rock,
which at high Water was overflow’d. A Boat coming near the Ship, in which
were six Men, whose long Hair hung down their Backs, one of them amongst the
rest standing up, call’d to the <i>Hollanders</i> in the <i>Ternaren</i> Language, saying, <i>What
People?</i> to which a Seaman, who understood and spake the said Language, answer’d,
<i>Spaniards</i>: whereupon he ask’d, <i>From what Countrey, and whither bound?</i> to
which he was answer’d, <i>From Moa to Ternata</i>: The <i>Southlander</i> hereupon reply’d,
<i>You are Deceivers,  the Ship is not Spanish, but Holland make</i>; whereupon <i>Tasman</i> caus’d
the Prince of <i>Orange</i>’s Flag to be put out, which the <i>Southlander</i> no sooner saw, but
he cry’d, <i>It appears by your Flags that you are Hollanders, who are always more welcom to us
than Spaniards</i>: However, though the Seaman acknowledg’d his mistake, in saying
they were <i>Spaniards</i>; yet the <i>Southlanders</i> would not stay within shot of them, but at
their Rowing away cry’d aloud, <i>Here is abundance of Pisang, Clappes, Potato’s, Sugar-Canes,
and other Fruits on Shore</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>From hence <i>Tasman</i> Sail’d Northerly between many Isles, and a Channel that
separates <i>New Guinee</i> from <i>Gilolo</i>, by <i>Cerani</i>, <i>Manipe</i>, <i>Bolao</i>, and <i>Burro</i>, to a narrow
Opening, where <i>Pangesane</i> being on his Larboard, rose with exceeding high
Rocks, as <i>Botton</i> on the Starboard. These Rocks are most of them overgrown
with Trees and Brambles. In the middle of this Channel also lies a Rock, for its
shape call’d <i>A Galley</i>, by which <i>Tasman</i> Sailing, bent his Course homeward, and at
last, on the fifteenth of <i>June</i>, Anno 1643. cast Anchor before <i>Batavia</i>.</p>

<h3 id='c661' class='c001'>CHAP. V.<br /> Terra Borealis, or The Artick Region.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>Having spoken something of the <i>Terra Australis Incognita</i>, or <i>Unknown South-Land</i>,
there remains something to be said of the opposite part, namely, the
<i>Terra Borealis</i>, or the <i>Artick Region</i>; which is call’d <i>Incognita</i> in like manner
as the <i>Terra Australis</i>, in regard, though very much, as well of the one as of the
other, hath been search’d into, and in part discover’d by several Voyagers, yet
doubtless there is a very vast Tract of Land, in the <i>Artick Region</i> especially (if it be
not rather Sea,) which is altogether unknown, and those parts which have been
discover’d, as  <i>Groenland</i>, <i>Iseland</i>, <i>Nova Zembla</i>, <i>Spilbergen</i>, <i>Hudson’s Straights</i> and <i>Bay</i>, &amp;c.
so imperfectly known, that they may well deserve the Title of <i>Unknown</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The several parts of this <i>Artick Region</i> are, 1. <i>Terra Subpolaris Incognita</i>, or that part
which lies directly under the <i>Pole</i>, and is otherwise call’d <i>Orbis Arcticus</i>. 2. <i>Groenland.</i>
3. <i>Spilbergen</i>, or <i>Nieuland</i>. 5. <i>Iseland.</i> 6. <i>Nova Zembla.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Description of <i>Terra Subpolaris</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Terra Subpolaris</i> is describ’d by a certain Seaman of <i>Bosleduc</i>, to be a great
black Rock, about thirty five Leagues in compass, and of an extraordinary heighth;
through the Land adjoyning to which the Sea violently breaking, makes four
great and violent <i>Euripi</i>, or Whirlpools, whose Waters driving Northward with
so forcible a Stream, that no Ship, though carry’d by never so strong a Gale,
is able to stem the Current, are at last swallow’d up in the Earth. It is also reported,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_661'>661</span>that between two of these <i>Euripi</i>, namely that made by the <i>Scythick</i> Ocean,
and that on the back side of <i>Groenland</i>, there lieth an Island Northward of <i>Lappia</i>
and <i>Biarmia</i>, inhabited by <i>Pygmies</i>. Much more to this purpose is related of the
<i>Subpolar</i> Region, but since it is very improbable that any one could come so near
as to make any discovery thereof, to say more of this Matter, would be but to insist
upon things favoring more of Fables than Reality.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Bounds and Situation of <i>Groenland</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Groenland</i> is that part of <i>Terra Septentrionalis</i>, which winds about from South to
East, and decline Northward from Cape <i>Faruel</i>, in the <i>Deucaledonian</i> Sea; however,
<i>Groenland</i> hath been generally taken for an Island; yet many late Navigators think
it joyns with the Continent of <i>Tartary</i>, and others leave it in doubt whether it be
Island or Continent: It is bounded towards the East with the <i>Deucaledonian</i> Ocean;
towards the West, with <i>Hudson’s Straights</i> and <i>Bay</i>, which separate it from <i>America</i>;
towards the North its Bounds are altogether unknown, and is not without reason
suppos’d to be the utmost part of the World towards the <i>North Pole</i>. There are
who believe it to be one Continent with <i>America</i>, and that upon this ground, because
several who have attempted to pass through the <i>Straight</i> commonly call’d
<i>The Straight of Davis</i>, into the <i>East-Indies</i>, affirm, that they found it to be a Gulph;
but one Captain <i>John Monk</i>, who was also a great Undertaker in the North-West
Passage through this <i>Straight</i>, or <i>Gulf of Davis</i>, alledges great Probabilities of this
Lands being divided by Sea from the Continent of <i>America</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Topography of <i>Groenland</i> from the <i>Danish</i> and <i>Iseland</i> Chronicles.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey hath anciently been divided into two Regions, <i>East-Groenland</i>
and <i>West-Groenland</i>; answerable to which Division <i>Errick</i>, surnam’d <i>The Ruddy</i>, the
Son of <i>Torvalde</i>, is reported by the <i>Danish</i> Chronicle to have built two Forts or
Lodges, <i>Ostrebug</i> and <i>Westrebug</i>, in the Eastern part. The first Planters of <i>Christianity</i>
built the City <i>Garde</i>, which became, as the said Chronicle mentions, a City of
great Repute and Traffick, and not long after, the Town <i>Albe</i>, and towards the
Sea-Coast, a Monastery, dedicated to <i>St. Thomas</i>. The City <i>Garde</i> was a Bishop’s
See, to which belong’d a Cathedral Church, by the Title of <i>St. Nicholas</i>, built in
the same City, though a certain <i>Iseland</i> Chronicle makes mention of the Church of
<i>Strosnes</i>, as the chief Metropolitan and Bishop’s See of <i>Groenland</i>. The Bishop assisted
oftentimes in the Assembly of the <i>Estates</i> of <i>Denmark</i>, and held of the Bishop
of <i>Nidrosia</i> or <i>Drunthen</i> in <i>Norway</i>, as the Temporal <i>Estate</i> of <i>Groenland</i> held of the
Crown of <i>Norway</i>, the <i>Norwegians</i> being the onely known Planters of this Countrey,
deriving their Original from the aforesaid <i>Errick</i>, according to the testimony of
<i>Mr. Vormius</i>, and also of <i>Angrimus Jonas</i>, in his <i>Specimen Islandicum</i>, and the Vice-Roy
of <i>Norway</i>, the <i>Nomophylax</i> (as the said <i>Angrimus</i> calls him,) or Sovereign Judge of the
Countrey. The Inhabitants of <i>Westreburg</i>, or the Western Coast of <i>Groenland</i>, are by
some call’d <i>Skreglinguers</i>. According to the <i>Iseland</i> Chronicle, the Towns and Places
of chief note are <i>Skageford</i>, in the most Eastern part; a little farther West the Port
of <i>Funchebuder</i>, so call’d from a Page of <i>St. Olaus</i> <i>King</i> of <i>Norway</i>, who together with
several others were cast away upon that place; a little higher, the <i>Roansen</i>, full of
white Bears, and other wild Beasts. In the Western Coast, <i>Kindelfiord</i>, an Arm of
the Sea; on the right Shore whereof stands <i>Korsekirk</i>, <i>i. e.</i> a Church built cross-ways;
also the Town <i>Vandalebug</i>, and not far off a Monastery, dedicated to <i>St.
Olaus</i> and <i>St. Augustine</i>; the next Place is <i>Rumpesinfiord</i>, where there is a religious
Convent, and divers little Islands, in which are Springs of Water, warm in the
winter, and temperate in the Summer, which are accounted Medicinal and of
great Vertue in the curing of divers Maladies; upon the same Coast lies <i>Etsnatsfiord</i>;
between which and <i>Rumpesinfiord</i> is the Palace <i>Fos</i>, and a great Church, dedicated
to <i>St. Nicholas</i>; near the Promontory <i>Clining</i> is another great House call’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_662'>662</span><i>Daller</i>, and beyond <i>Eynatsfiord</i>, a great Island denominated <i>Reynatsen</i>, from the abundance
of Rein-Deer which breed there: In the same Island is a Quarry of the
Stone <i>Talguestin</i>, not consumable by Fire, and yet soft enough to be cut into any
form, insomuch that Vessels have been made of it, containing twelve Tun. More
Westerly lies the Island <i>Langen</i>, and another Royal House call’d <i>Hellestad</i>, then <i>Erricksfford</i>,
another Arm of the Sea, and at the Entrance thereof, the Island <i>Herrieven</i>,
part whereof belongs to the <i>Dome</i>, or Cathedral, and the other part to the Church
of <i>Dunes</i>, the principal Church of <i>Groenland</i>, next to the Cathedral. North-West
from <i>Erricksfiord</i> is <i>Midfiord</i>, and farther Northward, <i>Bondeford</i>; near which are
several little Isles and Ports. Between <i>Ostrebug</i> and <i>Westrebug</i> is a large Desart, altogether
uninhabited.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Description of the Countrey, Extracted from the <i>Iseland</i> Chronicle, is
look’d upon by a late <i>French</i> Writer of note, as the most particular and faithful;
however, the <i>Danish</i> Chronicle differs in many things, and amongst others in this,
that not the hundredth part of <i>Groenland</i> is possess’d by the <i>Norwegians</i>, but that there
inhabit several different sorts of People, of different Fashions and Governments,
altogether unknown to the <i>Norwegians</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Temperature of <i>Groenland</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Groenland</i>, notwithstanding its Northerly Situation, is reported to be a Countrey
not unfertile of Corn, and other Productions of the Earth; and in respect of
its verdant Aspect at some Seasons of the Year, above the rest of those <i>Septentrional</i>
Regions, it is concluded to have merited the Name of <i>Groenland</i>, i.e. <i>Greenland</i>; nay,
so great is the Heat that is said to be there during the Moneths of <i>June</i>, <i>July</i>, and
<i>August</i>, by reason of the reverberation of the Sun-beams from the Rocks, that many
times there is but six Weeks space betwixt Seed-time and Harvest.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What sort of Animals breed there.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Beasts, which are said to breed here in great numbers, are Horses, Deer,
Foxes, Hares, Bears, both black and white, common Wolves, and a sort of Beast
between a Deer and a Wolf, besides great store of Beavers and Martins, as the
<i>Iseland</i> Chronicle testifies, whose Furr in fineness may compare with the Sables of
<i>Russia</i>. There are also Gerfalcons in abundance, both white and grey, of so delicate
a kind, that they were in ancient times sent to the Kings of <i>Denmark</i> as Presents
of great rarity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Seas about <i>Greenland</i> abound in very many sorts of Fish, as Sea-Wolves,
Sea-Dogs, Sea-Calves, and above all, incredible numbers of Whales of a vast
bigness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange kind of Horn found there.</div>

<p class='c010'>But the most remarkable Commodity of this Countrey, is a kind of Horn, commonly
call’d the <i>Licornes</i>, or <i>Unicorns-Horn</i>, which is found there in great quantities,
and great store of it is to be seen in <i>Denmark</i>, some whole, some in great pieces,
sometimes onely the Ends or Stumps; but since it appears very different from all
other kind of Horn, there is great Question made amongst Naturalists, whether it
be Horn or Tooth? and if Horn, whether the Horn of a Beast or Fish? but it is
discover’d of late to be the Horn, or rather Tusk of a certain Fish, which the
Islanders call <i>Narhual</i>, being indeed a kind of Whale, as the Name seems to imply;
signifying a Whale which feeds upon Carcases.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The chief Voyagers thither.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey is call’d by the Natives, <i>Secanunga</i>; who was the first Discoverer
thereof is not certainly known, but the first chief Voyagers thither were, of the
<i>Dutch</i>, <i>William Barents</i>, or <i>Barentson</i>, of <i>Amsterdam</i>, who set forth towards those Parts
in the Year 1594. and before him, <i>Dithmar Blefkens</i>, in the Year 1563. of the <i>English</i>,
Mr. <i>James Hall</i>, who set out from <i>Copenhagen</i> in <i>Denmark</i>, Anno 1605. and in a
second Voyage was slain by a Salvage of the Countrey.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Coastings, Havens, and Creeks of <i>Groenland</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Coastings, Courses, Havens and Creeks of <i>Groenland</i>, according as <i>Barentson</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_663'>663</span>receiv’d an Account of them from <i>Iver Boty</i>, a <i>Groenlander</i> written in the <i>Norsh</i> Language,
as it is call’d, are as followeth: From <i>Stad</i> in <i>Norway</i>, to <i>Hornness</i>, the
East part of <i>Groenland</i>, it is seven days Sailing. Between <i>Iseland</i> and <i>Groenland</i> lieth a
Riff call’d <i>Gombornse-skare</i>, the Ice lying upon which, hindreth the Passage. Those
that Sail from <i>Bergen</i> in <i>Norway</i> South of <i>Rokeness</i> in <i>Iseland</i>, come under <i>Swafster</i>, a
Promontory, or high Land in the East part of <i>Groenland</i>, and within sight of the
high Mount <i>Whitsark</i>; between which and <i>Groenland</i> lieth a Headland, call’d <i>Hernoldus
Hook</i>, not far from <i>Sound-Haven</i>, formerly much frequented by the <i>Norway</i>
Merchants. Those that Sail from <i>Iseland</i> to <i>Groenland</i>, Steer to <i>Snoffness</i>, West of
<i>Rokeness</i>, and after South-West. East of <i>Hernoldus Hook</i> lieth the Village of <i>Skagenford</i>,
the most Easterly Village of the Island; East of <i>Skagenford</i>, the Haven <i>Bearford</i>,
inaccessible by Ships, by reason of a great Riff lying at the Mouth thereof.
This Place is chiefly remarkable for the Whale-fishing, the Whales upon the going
back of the Tide running into a great <i>Swalth</i>, as they call it, which is in the Haven.
East of <i>Bearford</i> is the Haven call’d <i>Allabong Sound</i>, full of little Isles. East from
the Icy Mountain, the aforemention’d Haven <i>Fendobothes</i>. Farther East is the Highland
<i>Corse Hought</i>, where they Hunt white Bears. West from <i>Hernoldus Hook</i> is the
Village <i>Codosford</i>, and hard by the Sea-Coast, a fair Church, which we conceive to
be the same with <i>Korsekirk</i> above spoken of, as <i>Codosford</i> may also probably be the
same with <i>Kindelfiord</i>. A little farther West lieth the <i>Boy</i>, or Town of <i>Wartsdale</i> (for
in the <i>Norsh</i> Language <i>Boy</i> signifies a Town,) belonging to <i>Petresuik</i>, or <i>Peterswike</i>
Church: Near this <i>Boy</i> or Town standeth a Cloyster, or Abbey of Canons Regular,
dedicated to <i>St. Olafe</i> and <i>St. Augustine</i>. Next to <i>Codosford</i> is <i>Rompnesford</i>, the
same questionless with the above-mention’d <i>Rumpesinfiord</i>, where there is a Cloyster
of Nuns of the Order of <i>St. Benedict</i>: In this Ford lie many small Isles. Between
<i>Rompness</i> and the next Sound lieth a great Garden call’d <i>Vose</i>, belonging to the
King of the Countrey, as also <i>St. Nicholas</i> Church before mention’d. At the entrance
into <i>Emnestnesford</i> is the Inlet <i>Southwoderswike</i>, and somewhat higher on
the same side, the little Cape <i>Bloming</i>, beyond the Inlet <i>Granwike</i>; above that, the
Garden call’d <i>Daleth</i>, belonging to the Cathedral Church; and on the right-hand
to those that Sail out of the said Sound, a great Wood belonging to the same
Church, where they feed their Oxen, Kine, and Horses. The Highland lying by
<i>Emestnesford</i>, is call’d <i>The Ramas Hayth</i>, from the Rain-Deer which use to be there
Hunted: And hereabouts is that sort of Stone of which they make large Fats or
Cisterns, as hath been before intimated; it is by some call’d the <i>Zevell-Stone</i>, being
a sort of Marble, or (as some will have it) Load-stone, of all colours. West from
this lieth another Highland, call’d <i>Long-Highland</i>. The next Sound is call’d <i>Swalterford</i>,
having a Church belonging to it of the same Name, and where there is
also a Garden belonging to the King, call’d <i>St. Hentelstad</i>. Next to that lieth
<i>Erricksford</i>, and at the entrance thereof the Highland <i>Erricks Hought</i>, belonging to
<i>Deverskirk</i>, the first Parochial Church in <i>Groenland</i>. North-West from <i>Erricksford</i>,
is <i>Megdenford</i>. Farther out is a Church call’d <i>Scogelkirk</i>; and farther in the Sound,
<i>Leadenkirk</i>. Beyond <i>Erricksford</i> is another Ford or Sound, by the Name of
<i>Fossa</i>, belonging to the Cathedral Church; and to the North of it, two Villages,
<i>Ever-boy</i> and <i>Forther-boy</i>. From thence farther North lieth <i>Bredaford</i>; and after
that <i>Lormontford</i>; and from thence Westward, <i>Icedeep</i>. To the North of the
<i>Westland</i> lieth a spacious Wilderness, call’d <i>Hemel Hatsfelt</i>, and Edg’d with massie
Rocks and Cliffs towards the Sea side; beyond which the Sea is innavigable, by
reason of the many <i>Swalgen</i>, or Whirlpools thereabouts.</p>

<p class='c010'>In <i>Groenland</i> there are divers Hills, wherein are Silver-Mines, multitudes of white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_664'>664</span>Bears, with red Patches on their Heads; also white Hawks, and all sorts of Fish.
There are moreover in the Countrey divers Rivers, frozen up for the most part of
the Year, and cover’d with Ice; yet it is generally affirm’d, that it is not so cold
there as in <i>Norway</i> or <i>Iseland</i>. On the Hills are said to grow Acorns and Nuts, very
well tasted, and as big as Apples; also as good Wheat as is commonly produc’d in
other Parts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An Account of <i>Groenland</i> from <i>Dithmar Blefkens</i> his <i>Journal</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the <i>Journal</i> of <i>Dithmar Blefkens</i>’s Voyage, mention is made of a certain blind
Monk, brought up in the Monastery of <i>St. Thomas</i>, who reported several memorable
things concerning this Countrey, as that it was call’d <i>Groenland</i> antiphrastically,
or by contrariety of Speech, as appearing seldom or never green; and that it
abounded with Bears and white Foxes, and was not without Pygmies and Unicorns,
which never appear’d till after the Sun was entred into <i>Aries</i>; that in the said Monastery
of <i>St. Thomas</i> there was a Fountain of scalding Water, which was convey’d
through Pipes of Stones to the Monks several Cells, and serv’d them not onely for
Stoves, but for the dressing of their Meat, which was as well boyl’d by means of
this Water, as if it had been over a real Fire, and that the Walls of the Monastery
were made of a kind of Pumice-stone, upon which if Water were pour’d, it would
produce a slimy Matter, commonly us’d in stead of Lime for Mortar, like the Stone
of Mount <i>Hecla</i> in <i>Iseland</i>; that two of these Pygmies, a Male and a Female, were
kept by the Abbot, and were both endu’d with perfect humane Shape, and overgrown
with Hair, even to the outermost Joynts of their Fingers, the Male especially,
who had a Beard reaching down to his Knees, but that they seem’d wholly
devoid of Reason and Understanding, nor had any distinct use of Speech, onely
made a semblance of Hissing of the manner of Geese; lastly, he reported the duration
of the Lives of these Creatures to be answerable to the shortness of their Stature;
but that concerning their Wars with the Cranes, he had no other knowledge
than by Tradition.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>From Mr. <i>James Hall</i>’s Description.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Description of <i>Groenland</i> left by Mr. <i>James Hall</i>, renders it a high, mountainous,
and craggy Region, sufficiently water’d with Rivers, and provided with
good Harbors, of a Soil not unfertile in all places where he came, having between
the Mountains fruitful Valleys and pleasant Plains, abounding with several sorts
of Fowl, as Partridges, Pheasants, Sea-mews, Gulls, Crows, <i>&amp;c.</i> but of Beasts,
chiefly black Foxes, and (as was conjectur’d by the plenty of Harts-horns found
about their Tents) Rein-Deer, yet not destitute of other Beasts, the <i>Vestigium</i> of
one whereof was found to be not less than eight Inches over.</p>

<p class='c010'>As for the Manners and Customs of the Natives, they are by the said Description
represented to be a kind of <i>Samoid</i>, or wandring People, still moving from
place to place, warlike and active, using Slings and Darts with marvellous dexterity,
of a brown Complexion for the most part, and of an indifferent Stature, eating
their Meat either quite raw, or onely a little parboyl’d, Clothing themselves
with the Skins of such Beasts, or other Creatures, as they kill, especially Seals, or
some of the largest size of Fowls, which they Dress very smooth and soft, turning
the Feather or Hair side outwards in Summer, and inward in Winter. Their Weapons
Bowes, Slings, and Bone or Iron-headed Darts; their Religion Idolatrous, but
chiefly Sun-Worship, as was gather’d from their manner of Accost, when any of the
<i>English</i> first approach’d them, for they us’d to point up to the Sun, as chief Author
of their felicity, and then beat their Breasts, crying, <i>Iliont</i>, which seem’d to signifie
as much as <i>I mean no harm</i>, and would not come near till those that met them did
the like. Their Houses built of Whales Bones, and the Baulks thereof with Whales
Ribs, and cover’d with Earth, but the best sort with Seal-Skins, having Vaults or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_665'>665</span>Rooms under Ground, four-square, and two Yards deep in the Earth. Their
manner of Burial, a Pile of Stones thrown over the Corps, being first wrapt up in
Seal-Skins.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First Discovery of <i>Spilbergia</i> or <i>Greenland</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Spilbergia</i>, so call’d by the <i>Hollanders</i>, from <i>Spilbergen</i>, whom probably they reckon
to have been the first Discoverer of it, is the same that we vulgarly call <i>Greenland</i>,
and which Sir <i>Hugh Willoughby</i> (if not the first of all, yet at least the first of the
<i>English</i> that discover’d any thing of these Parts) nam’d <i>King James’s New-Land</i>. The
said Sir <i>Hugh Willoughby</i> set forth <i>Anno 1553.</i> in the <i>Bona Esperanza</i>, accompany’d
with two Ships more, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Bonaventure</i>, <i>Richard Challoner</i> Captain, and the <i>Bona
Confidentia</i>, and after some time of Coasting up and down those Northern Seas, he
Landed with his Company upon the Place, where staying a few days, he sent three
Men three days Journey into the Countrey South-West, and three more as far full
West, who all, after much hardship in their Travelling, return’d without having
met any People by the Way, or seen the least appearance of any Habitation. Sailing
hence back for <i>Lapland</i>, they were all frozen to death in the Haven <i>Arzina</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Fotherby</i>’s
Description
of <i>Greenland</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>A Description of <i>Greenland</i> by one Mr. <i>Robert Fotherby</i>, represents the Nature
of this Place contradictory to its Name, as before was observ’d of <i>Groenland</i>: “For
certainly (saith he) no part of the World, yet known and discover’d, is less Green
than this, both the Mountains and Low-lands being cover’d with Snow till the
beginning of <i>June</i>. The Countrey, which is for the most part mountainous,
bearing neither Grass nor Tree, save onely Heath or Ling, as it is call’d in the
North parts of <i>England</i>, which grows upon the Moors or Heathy Grounds when
the Snow begins to melt, and on which in Summer the Deer feed themselves fat in
one Moneth; but how they live in the Winter, is a thing beyond any Man’s skill
to comprehend, especially during the Sun’s absence under the Horizon, which
in the Latitude of seventy seven Degrees continues from the eighteenth of <i>October</i>
to the fourth of <i>February</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey is by many suppos’d never to have been inhabited by Men, yet
not altogether uncapable of affording Habitation to such as would bring with
them sufficient defensive Weapons against Hunger and Cold: For other Animals, it
is found, by the testimony of those that have been upon the Place, not to be destitute;
for besides Deer before mention’d, there have been seen Bears and Foxes;
and of wild Fowl, <i>Cuthbert</i> Ducks, Willocks, Stints, Sea-Pigeons, Sea-Parrots,
Gulls, Noddies, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>The Southermost part of <i>Greenland</i>, call’d <i>Point Look-out</i>, stands in seventy six
Degrees and thirty Minutes. The West side of the Land was discover’d by the
first Voyagers Northward as far as eighty Degrees and odd Minutes, and in that
compass six or eight good Harbors for the Whale-fishing; the East side as far as
seventy eight Degrees, with divers Islands, both great and small, yielding good
Harbors, and store of Whales and Sea-Horses.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Voyages of <i>Jonas Pool</i> and others to <i>Greenland</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1610. <i>Jonas Pool</i>, Master of the <i>Amity</i> fell in with this Land in <i>May</i>,
and continu’d upon the Coast, discovering of Harbors, and killing of <i>Morses</i>, till
<i>June</i> following: and he is said to have been the first that gave this Countrey the
Name of <i>Greenland</i>. The next year he set out again, accompany’d with <i>Thomas
Edge</i>, Commander of the <i>Mary Margaret</i>; And since many other Voyages have been
made as to a Place known, and a great Trade driven in catching of Whales, not
without several Contests with the <i>Dutch</i> and <i>Danes</i>, but nothing of late discover’d
considerable more than in the first Voyages. The Harbors, Sounds and Coastings
most taken notice of, are <i>Fair Foreland</i>, <i>Cape Cold</i>, <i>Black-Point</i>, <i>Horn-Sound</i>, <i>Knotty-Point</i>,
<i>Bell-Sound</i>, <i>Lowness</i>, <i>Cross-Road</i>, <i>Deer-Sound</i>, <i>Fowl-Sound</i>, <i>Close-Cove</i>, <i>Gurnet-Nose</i>, <i>Ice-Sound</i>,
and <i>Green-Haven</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cherry-Island.</i></div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_666'>666</span>There are few that have Sail’d to <i>Greenland</i>, but make great mention of <i>Cherry
Island</i>, so call’d, as having been first discover’d at the Charges of Sir <i>Francis Cherry</i>,
an eminent Merchant; by others <i>Bear-Island</i>, from the multitude of Bears found
there; it lies in the Latitude of seventy four Degrees, and is noted for store of
Fowl, Foxes like Dogs, and upon the Coasts great store of Whales, Sea-Horses, and
Morses: It is also said to be furnish’d with Lead-Mines, and Pits of Sea-Coal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Situation and first Discovery of <i>Iseland</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Iseland</i>, so call’d from the continual Ice which is upon it, is a craggy mountainous
Countrey; and not onely the Hills, but a great part of the Low-land cover’d
with perpetual Snow: It is of a Form somewhat oblong, lying between the fifty
fourth and fifty ninth Degree of Northern Latitude, having <i>Norway</i> on the East, the
<i>Orcades</i> and <i>Scotland</i> on the South, Grenland on the West, and the <i>Hyperborean</i>, or frozen
Sea on the North. It is by <i>Olaus Magnus</i> suppos’d to be twice as big as <i>Sicily</i>, that is
to say, about a hundred Leagues in length. It is the most known, and most througly
discover’d of all the Countreys of the <i>Artick Region</i>, and is said to have been first
found out and peopled in the Year of our Lord 900. by certain of the Nobility of
<i>East-Frisia</i> in the Countrey of <i>Breme</i>, in the time of <i>Alebrand</i>, Bishop of that Countrey;
but whether or no utterly unpeopled till that time, is a Question not easie to
be determin’d, though in all probability so obvious a Place to be found out, could
not lie so long totally uninhabited. Not long after several Colonies of <i>Norwegians</i>
Setled themselves, some in <i>Hitland</i>, some in <i>Ferow</i>, others (following the Example
of these <i>Bremers</i>) in <i>Iseland</i>. The Countrey is full of Rocks and Stones, and (as is
credibly reported) not a cultivated Field or Garden in the whole Island, and by
consequence no sort of Corn, yet the People living without either Bread or Salt,
are very strong, and of a good Complexion: Neither is there a Tree to be seen,
except the Birch, which likewise grows but in one place, and exceeds not the
heighth of a Man, by reason of the violence of the Winds; yet there is said to be
great plenty of Butter, the Grass being so fat, that the Oxen are not suffer’d to stay
long at a time in the Pastures for fear of bursting. Till of late there was neither
Town, nor any thing that could be call’d a Village, in the whole Island, but
stragling Cottages here and there, not above three or four together in a place, most
by the Sea side for the convenience of Fishing; they were built pretty deep in the
Ground, but artificially fram’d of Whales Bones, with Seats, Benches, and other
Utensils of the same; now sometimes they use Fir to the same purpose, which is
cast upon the Coast by the force of the Sea from <i>Tartary</i> or elsewhere. For want of
Vessels, they lay their Butter in Heaps in the Corners of their Houses like Mortar.
In the Winter, wanting Fodder, they feed their Cattel with Fish. Besides these
Cattel, which are Kine without Horns, Horses onely fit for carrying of Burthens,
and very large Sheep, there are store of white Foxes, and huge Bears of the same
colour, and a sort of rough Dogs, very well known, and frequent amongst us by
the Name of <i>Shocks</i>, which the Islanders esteem not a little, and will part with their
Children at a far easier rate: They keep neither Hogs nor Poultrey, for want of
Grain to feed them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Many Rivers in <i>Iseland</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Rivers belonging to this Island are many, and those not unpleasant, affording
to the Inhabitants plenty of Fish, especially Sturgeon, Trouts, and Salmons;
and one is especially remarkable for a Bridge made over it, which being the onely
Bridge of the Countrey, is made of the great Bones of a Whale. The whole Island
is one continu’d Desart, without any trodden Path or Road from one end to the
other; so that all that have occasion to travel to any part thereof by Land, make
use of the Compass, as if they were Voyaging by Sea.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Fish on the Coast of <i>Iseland</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Coast of <i>Iseland</i> hath many strange and monstrous Fish worth observation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_667'>667</span>as first the <i>Orca</i>, which though nothing near so big as the Whale, yet is able to be
the death of it; for being of the shape of a Ship turn’d upside-down, and having
sharp long Fins on its Back, it pricks the Belly of the Whale therewith till it kills.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next is the <i>Hackfall</i>, which is very fat, and about twelve Inches long.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then the Dog-Fish, which lifting up its Head out of the Sea, Barks, and letting
forth its young ones, receives them into her Belly again, when they have sported a
while in the Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, another Monster, of a most frightful shape, mention’d by <i>Olaus Magnus</i>,
but not by any particular Name.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strange Fountains.</div>

<p class='c010'>In divers Parts of the Island are Fountains of scalding Water, which as soon as
taken from the Fountain begins to cool, and when cold, hath a sulphury Substance
swimming on the top.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the West end is a smoaky Fountain, very cold, and turning all that is cast
into it into Stone.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the place upon the Sea call’d <i>Turlocks Haven</i>, are two Fountains of different
quality, the one hot, the other cold, which by Pipes being brought together into
one place, make a Bath of an excellent temperature, and of a medicinal Vertue.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not far from <i>Haven Halneford</i> is a Cliff in a Rock of an unknown depth, and no
Water to be discern’d by those that look down into it, but if a Stone be cast in, it
shall make a noise for half an hour together, as if it were striking against a Brazen
Vessel, and all this while the Water will be rising till it comes up to the brim, and
then will be so long sinking again as the Stone was falling.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Mountains of <i>Iseland</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>There are also three Mountains in <i>Iseland</i> not to be left unmention’d, the Mountain
of the <i>Cross</i>, the Mountain <i>Snenelstockel</i>, and the Mountain <i>Hecla</i>; the two first
are chiefly considerable for their wonderful heighth, and for the dreadful noise of
Thunder which is heard on the top of them, when in the adjacent parts below, the
Air is calm and clear; the third lying in the North of the Island, and not very high,
is one of the most prodigious <i>Vulcans</i> in the World, for the casting forth of Flames,
black Ashes, and Pumice-Stones, insomuch that there is no possibility of Habitation
within six Miles of it round about; and it is a receiv’d Opinion of the Inhabitants,
that it is the place of Torment for the Souls of the Damned; from whence
there hath risen such a company of strange Stories and Fables, that it would make
up a Volume of it self to relate them. The occasion of the great Eruption of this
Mountain is not without much reason imputed to the inflammation of the Sulphur,
of which there are several Mines or Pits in the Countrey, though none of
any sort of Metal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First planting of <i>Christian Religion</i> here.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Waldemarus</i>, King of <i>Denmark</i> and <i>Norway</i>, being consequently Master of this
amongst the other <i>Norwegian</i> Colonies, Planted the <i>Christian</i> Religion in this
Island in the Year of <i>Christ</i> 1398. and Ordain’d two Bishops, one in <i>Schalholden</i>, in
the East part, another in <i>Hollen</i>, in the West; and after the <i>Reformation</i> was begun,
<i>Christianus</i>, King of <i>Denmark</i>, took care to propagate the Reformed <i>Doctrine</i> there, as
well as in other parts of his Dominions; and to that end sent over a <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Printer</span></em>
thither, that the <em class='gesperrt'><i>BIBLE</i></em>, together with the Works of <i>Philip Melancthon</i> and <i>Urbanus
Regius</i>, might be publish’d in the Vulgar Tongue of the Countrey. But these
Proceedings were mainly oppos’d by the Bishop of <i>Schalholden</i>, who animating the
People to Rebellion, they slew the King’s Lieutenant: Whereupon the next Year
<i>Paul Holfelt</i>, a Knight of the <i>Danish</i> Order, being sent over with an Army, overthrew
the Rebels, and taking off the chief Heads of the Rebellion, committed the
Charge of the Government to another Nobleman of <i>Denmark</i>, whom he left upon
the Place. But one <i>Tadde Bonde</i>, a great Man of the Countrey, meditating a Revolt,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_668'>668</span>drew divers Persons of principal note into Conspiracy with him, and was advancing
to a formidable Power, had not the Bishop given continual Intelligence of
their Proceedings to the King’s Lieutenant, who thereupon employ’d Agents to
the chief Accomplices of the Faction, and what with fair Means and threatnings
so wrought with them, that they return’d to their Obedience, and forsook <i>Todde</i>,
insomuch that he flying with a small Party, betook himself to a fastness at the
Foot of <i>Heckelveld</i>, where being hemm’d in, those about him were slain, and he
himself taken Prisoner; and because no Man to whose safe custody he was offer’d
durst receive him, so much dreaded was his Power, one <i>Jonas</i>, a bold courageous
Fellow, slew him with his own Hand, and thereby put an end to all farther Tumults
and Seditions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The People <i>Iseland</i> addicted to Sorcery and Superstition.</div>

<p class='c010'>So much have the People of this Island been ever addicted to Sorcerie and Superstition,
that notwithstanding the Profession of <i>Christianity</i>, and the frequent
Preaching against those Sins, especially since the <i>Reformation</i>, the generality of
them are still wedded to many of those old diabolical Customs, which were practis’d
there in time of <i>Paganism</i>; and amongst other things they are said to be serv’d,
many of them, by Spirits, which constantly attend them, and as <i>Olaus Magnus</i>
writes of the <i>Finlanders</i>, they are oftentimes dealt with by Strangers, to sell them
prosperous Winds for Money, and (doubtless by the help of the Devil) perform
the same; as also on the contrary, they are said by their Enchantments to stop the
Course of a Ship, and make it as it were immovable, though in the Stream of never
so prosperous a Gale. They are a proud, haughty People, and for the most
part endu’d with vast strength of Body; their Habit so promiscuous, that neither
Sex can be distinguish’d by it. They are not onely forward to prostitute their
Daughters to those <i>Germans</i> that Trade with them at <i>Hafnefords</i>, but that Virgin
who hath had to do with a <i>German</i>, shall be sure to be so much the more esteem’d
and Courted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Towns and Places of note.</div>

<p class='c010'>The onely Towns and Buildings of note here, and those created but of late Ages,
are 1. <i>Hafnefords</i>, a Haven Town, chiefly frequented by <i>Dutch</i> Merchants for
Traffick with the Natives.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <i>Bedstede</i>, the Residence of the Lord Lieutenant or Governor for the King of
<i>Denmark</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. The Bishops See of <i>Halsar</i>, having four Monasteries belonging to it, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Pingore</i>, <i>Remestede</i>, <i>Modor</i>, and <i>Monkeniere</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. The Bishops See of <i>Schalholt</i>, to which also doth belong four Monasteries, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Vedey</i>, <i>Pernebar</i>, <i>Kirkebar</i>, and <i>Schirde</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their Place and manner of Judicature.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Nobles of <i>Iseland</i> are call’d <i>Bonden</i>; their <i>Justiciaries</i> or Judges, being twelve
in number, <i>Lochmaders</i>, that is, Men of Law or Justice, who are said to meet once
a year on the twenty ninth of <i>June</i>, to administer Justice in a place ordain’d for that
purpose in the midst of the Island, appearing like some feigned Paradice, so pleasant
a place it is represented to be at that time of the year, being (as the Tradition
goes) from a high burning Mountain like <i>Hecla</i>, consum’d to a Plain, and so environ’d
with Rocks, that there was left but a small Passage for one at a time to enter.
Here the Governor having first given the Charge, leaves the Trial of all Matters
to the <i>Lochmaders</i>, who having diligently heard every Cause argued on both sides,
withdraw for a while to Consult together, and then proceed to Sentence, the same
Persons being both Jury and Judge; but if any Case of difficulty or scruple arise,
they consult the Governor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Angrimus Jonas</i>’s Relation of <i>Iseland</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Angrimus Jonas</i>’s Relation of <i>Iseland</i> differing much from what hath been deliver’d
by <i>Blefkens</i>, is not to be omitted. He saith it was first discover’d by one <i>Naddocus</i>, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_669'>669</span>Pyrate, who going towards the <i>Farensian</i> Islands, was cast by Tempest upon the
Shore of <i>East-Iseland</i>, near the Mountain <i>Reidarfial</i>; and as he departed from the
Coast, perceiving the tops of the highest Mountains cover’d with a very deep
Snow, call’d the Island <i>Snælandia</i>, that is, <i>Snowy Countrey</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Gardarus</i>’s Voyage to <i>Iseland</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>Upon the fame of <i>Naddocus</i>’s Discovery, one <i>Gardarus</i>, the Son of <i>Suavarus</i>, a
<i>Swede</i>, was desirous to make a Voyage thither, and arriving near the Eastern Shore,
Winter’d in the Bay of <i>Skialfanda</i>, or <i>North-Island</i>, in the Year of our Lord 864. and
call’d the Haven <i>Huscawick</i>, from the Houses or Wintering-places built there, as the
next Haven to it was call’d <i>Nartarawick</i>, from <i>Natrare</i>, an eminent Mariner in this
Expedition. <i>Gardarus</i> returning home about the beginning of the Spring, call’d
the Countrey from his own Name <i>Gardarsholm</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Flocco</i>’s Voyage to the same Place.</div>

<p class='c010'>The next that follow’d his Example, was one <i>Flocco</i>, a famous Pyrate, whose
Daughter <i>Geirhilda</i> being drown’d upon the Coast of <i>Schetland</i> (anciently <i>Hietland</i>,)
gave the Name of <i>Geirhildarwata</i> to the Sea thereabouts: Not having the use of the
Mariners Compass, he made use of Ravens for the steering of his Course, and having
sent forth two without success, by the guidance of the third he had sight of
the Eastern side of the Island; and Steering Southward, he found a very wide Bay,
between the Promontories <i>Renkanes</i> and <i>Snæfesness</i>; which Bay, from <i>Faxa</i> a <i>Scottish</i>
Mariner that accompany’d him, he nam’d <i>Faxaos</i>, that is, <i>The Mouth of Faxa</i>,
though from its many Havens it came afterwards to be term’d <i>Hafnafiordur</i>.
Sailing along the West side of the Island, he entred the Bay <i>Bredafiord</i>, and
took up his Quarters at <i>Watnesfiordur</i>, a Haven in the Province <i>Bardostraund</i> (for by
these Names these Places came afterwards to be known:) Having stay’d here two
Winters, he return’d back into <i>Norway</i>, and is said to have been the first that gave
this Countrey the Name of <i>Iseland</i>, from the great quantities of Ice which fill’d
the Seas thereabouts, he also gave it the Name of <i>Rafnaflock</i>, from the Ravens
which serv’d him in stead of a Compass.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Plantation setled in <i>Ise</i> by <i>Ingulphus</i> and <i>Hiorleifus</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The last and most considerable Adventurer was <i>Ingulfus</i>, the Son of <i>Orn</i>, Duke
of <i>Fyrdafilace</i> in <i>Norway</i>, who, together with his Cousin <i>Hiorleifus</i>, that Marry’d his
Sister <i>Helca</i>, being adjudg’d to Banishment by <i>Halsten</i> (to the Award of whose
Judgment they had submitted themselves) upon the slaughter of his two Brethren,
<i>Holmsten</i> and <i>Hersten</i>, (these three Brethren were the Sons of <i>Atlas</i>, one of the prime
Noblemen of <i>Norway</i>) in a Quarrel, wherein <i>Halsten</i> was chosen Umpire; and also
detesting the Tyranny of <i>Haraldus Pulchricomus</i>, King of Norway, went over <i>Gonfaloniere</i>,
or chief Leader of a great Colony of People, whom he rais’d for the setling
of a Plantation in some foreign Countrey: Accompany’d with his Cousin <i>Hiorleifus</i>,
he took Shipping for <i>Iseland</i> in the Year of our Lord 854. having been over
to visit it about four years before; he Landed at a Promontory on the South
Shore, which from him took the Name of <i>Ingulfholde</i>, and at <i>Reicharwick</i> setled his
Habitation, while <i>Hiorleifus</i> seated himself at the Promontory by him call’d <i>Hiorleifholda</i>,
where he built two very large Houses, each being about a hundred and
thirty Foot long; then he set himself to Manure and Till the Ground, employing
in that Work ten Slaves, whom he brought with him for that purpose out of <i>Norway</i>;
but it was not long ere they traiterously set upon him and slew him by an
Ambuscade which they had laid for him; after which they betook themselves to
certain little Isles, which were nam’d <i>Westmafyar</i>, where before they had well nestled
themselves, the whole Race of them were rooted out by <i>Ingulphus</i>, in revenge
of his Kinsman’s Death. After this the Island grew daily more and more populous
by the coming over of new Families from <i>Norway</i>; so that at this day it is a Place
not the least considerable belonging to the Kings of <i>Denmark</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_670'>670</span>The ancient Inhabitants of this Place (for it is to be suppos’d that there were
People here before the coming over of <i>Ingulfus</i>) were call’d <i>Papæ</i> or <i>Pappæ</i>, and the
East side of the Island, <i>Papey</i>, which agrees very well with the Names of two little
Islands on the Coast of <i>Scotland</i>, <i>Pappa</i> and <i>Westrepappa</i>, from which many conjecture,
as also from several Crosses and Bells found upon the Place, that there hath been
in former Ages a resort of the <i>Irish</i>, and of the People of the North-West parts of
<i>Scotland</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Division of <i>Iseland</i>.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Eastern Bound of <i>Iseland</i> is call’d <i>Austurhorn</i>; the Western, <i>Randesandur</i>;
the Northern, <i>Langanes</i>; and the Southern, <i>Reicranes</i>. The Island being divided according
to the four Quarters of the World, <i>North-Island</i> is sever’d from <i>East-Island</i>
by the aforesaid Promontory of <i>Langanes</i>; from <i>West-Island</i> by <i>Rutafiordur</i> Bay;
from <i>South-Island</i>, by vast and unpassable Desarts. Between <i>South-Island</i> and <i>East-Island</i>
runneth the River <i>Jocolsu</i>, through the Desarts of <i>Solseimasande</i>. Between
<i>South-Island</i> and <i>West-Island</i> a famous River nam’d <i>Albis</i>, which emptieth it self into
the Bay of <i>Bargarfiord</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Schetland</i> the <i>Thule</i> of the Ancients.</div>

<p class='c010'>’Tis a vulgar Opinion, that this Island is the same which the Ancients call’d
<i>Thule</i>; but upon consideration it will appear, that by the <i>Ultima Thule</i> taken notice
of by <i>Virgil</i>, <i>Claudian</i>, <i>Statius</i>, <i>Pythias Massiliensis</i>, <i>Pliny</i>, <i>Seneca</i>, <i>Solinus</i>, <i>Tacitus</i>, and
others, is meant one of the <i>British</i> Isles, amongst which were comprehended
the Isles on the North of <i>Scotland</i>, as the <i>Orcades</i>, and some others, the utmost of
which we call <i>Schetland</i>, and is very probable to be this <i>Ultima Thule</i> of the Ancients.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Nova Zembla</i>, when first discover’d.</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Nova Zembla</i>, lying under seventy six Degrees of Northern Latitude, and a hundred
and twelve Degrees and twenty five Minutes of Longitude, and being reckon’d
above two hundred Miles in length, was, together with the River <i>Puora</i>,
and Straights of <i>Weygats</i>, discover’d, (and, as it is thought, first of all) by <i>Stephen Burrough</i>,
who was sent out by the <i>Muscovia</i> Company in the Year 1556. to find out a
Way to <i>Cathay</i> by the North-East.</p>

<p class='c010'>Afterwards one <i>Oliver Bunel</i>, a <i>Dutch</i>-man, mov’d with the hope of Gain, went
from <i>Enkhuissen</i> to <i>Pecora</i>; where (having first discover’d <i>Costinfarca</i> in <i>Nova Zembla</i>)
he lost all by Shipwrack.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>States-General</i> nothing discourag’d with the little success of these two Voyagers,
sent forth two Ships under the Command of <i>Hugo Linschot</i>, to the Straights of
<i>Weygats</i>, and two others under <i>William Barrents</i>, who were to go directly Northwards
for <i>Nova Zembla</i>: <i>Linschot</i> went fifty Miles beyond the Straights, but the Northerly
Winds and late Season of the year forc’d him to hasten back with all possible
speed. <i>William Barents</i> and his Company were necessitated in the Year 1596. being
not able to get off, in regard the Ice increas’d upon them more and more, to take
up their Winter Quarters there in a Cottage, which they made a shift to cast up
for their present necessity, having much ado to defend themselves against the Bears,
that continually assaulted them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of the Countrey.</div>

<p class='c010'>This Countrey is generally deliver’d to be a barren and desart Countrey, full
of Wood indeed, but the Boughs as bare of Leaves, as the Ground of Grass; also
very incommodious to be travell’d through, by reason of its desartness, and the
danger of Bears, great fierce Foxes, and such like ravenous Beasts, which feed onely
upon Flesh, and which are the onely Beasts this Countrey harbors.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a <i>Journal</i> of Mr. <i>Henry Hudson</i>, there is to be found a much more favorable
Description of the Countrey: “Generally (saith he) the Land of <i>Nova Zembla</i>
that we have seen, is to a Man’s Eye a pleasant Land, much Main High-land
with no Snow on it, looking in some places green, and Deer feeding thereon,
and the Hills partly cover’d with Snow, and partly bare.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_671'>671</span>It should seem to have been a receiv’d Opinion from the first Discovery of
<i>Nova Zembla</i>, that it was inhabited by <i>Pygmies</i>, it being several times, in the <i>Journals</i>
of some Voyages, mention’d particularly by the Name of <i>The Land of Pygmies</i>, but
upon what certain Ground cannot in the least be discover’d; for we find not from
the <i>Russians</i> (to whom the Place, by reason of its Vicinity, is probable to have been
first known) any other Account of the Inhabitants, but that they are a People
wholly destitute of civil Manners, and unlimited by Law or Religion, saving that
they seem to give some kind of Adoration to the Sun, Moon, and North-star, and
have some Qualities which speak them rational Creatures; whereas the <i>Pygmies</i>
(if there be any such Creatures) are thought to have nothing of Humane but their
Shape onely.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Willoughby-Island.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Besides <i>Nova Zembla</i> there is not far from it another Island, known by the Name
of <i>Willoughby-Island</i>, from Sir <i>Hugh Willoughby</i>, the first Discoverer; they both are of
the Dominions of the <i>Czar</i> of <i>Russia</i>.</p>

<h4 id='c672' class='c013'><i>Several Attempts for the discovery of the</i> North-West Passage.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>What hath been discover’d of Sea in the North or South parts of the World, is
of no less Consequence than what hath been discover’d of Land, and the
<i>Straight</i> of <i>Hudson</i> Northward, is no less considerable than the <i>Straight</i> of <i>Magellan</i>
South; we shall therefore compleat this Discourse of the <i>Artick Region</i> with a
brief Mention of what Capes, Bays, Sounds, &amp;c. have been found out by those that
have attempted to find a Passage by the North-West to the <i>East-Indies</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not to insist upon the fabulous Stories of King <i>Arthur</i>’s first conquering <i>Ireland</i>,
and then Sailing into the Northern Seas, and subduing <i>Scantia</i>, <i>Iseland</i>, <i>Groenland</i>,
and (as the Story saith) many other Islands beyond <i>Norway</i> even under the <i>Pole</i>, or
of <i>Malgo</i>’s subduing <i>Ireland</i>, <i>Iseland</i>, the <i>Orcades</i> and <i>Norway</i>, or <i>Octher</i>’s Reports to
King <i>Alfred</i> of his Voyages to the North-East parts beyond <i>Norway</i>, or the Voyages
of the two famous <i>Venetian</i> Brethren, <i>Nicolo</i> and <i>Antonio Zeni</i>, or of <i>Marcus Paulus
Venetus</i>, <i>Odoricus</i> and <i>Vertomannus</i>; the first <i>English</i>-man we hear of, that made an
Expedition into those Northern Seas, was Sir <i>Hugh Willoughby</i>, before taken notice
of for the Discovery of <i>King James’s Newland</i> and <i>Willoughby-Island</i>, in the Year of
our Lord 1553.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Stephen Burroughs</i> (as hath been intimated) discover’d amongst other Places,
about the Year 1556. the <i>Straight</i> of <i>Vaigats</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Queen Elizabeths Foreland.</i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Forbisher’s Straight.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>In the Year 1576. Sir <i>Martin Forbisher</i> setting forth with two Barques, after
he had been out about five Weeks, had sight of a High-land, which he nam’d
<i>Queen Elizabeths Foreland</i>: Thence Sailing more Northerly to the heighth of about
sixty two Degrees, he descry’d a great Sea or Inlet, which he entred, and thence it
took the Appellation of <i>Forbisher’s Straight</i>. About two years after proceeding to a
farther discovery of it, he entred a good way into it, and took possession of the
utmost Place he went to for Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, who thereupon gave it the Name of
<i>Meta Incognita</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Anno 1580.</i> <i>Arthur Pett</i> and <i>Charles Jackman</i> were sent out by the <i>Russian</i> Company,
to make a Discovery of the River <i>Ob</i>, and passing the <i>Straight</i> of <i>Waigats</i>, took particular
observation of the Islands and Places there, but not being able to pass much
farther, by reason of the Ice, towards the latter end of the year they return’d.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Davis’s Straight.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>In prosecution of this Discovery to the North-West, Captain <i>John Davis</i> of <i>Sandruge</i>
in <i>Devonshire</i>, made three Voyages; his first <i>Anno 1585.</i> his second, 1587. in
which he met with many strange Adventures; but the main thing that accru’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_672'>672</span>from these Voyages, was the finding of a mighty Through-let between vast and
desart Islands, to which his Name gave the Appellation of <i>Fretum Davis</i>, or <i>Davis’s
Straight</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next that went upon this Design was Captain <i>George Weymouth</i>, who from
the Year 1585 to 1602 made several Expeditions, which produc’d large Relations
of strange Accidents that befell them, but little of Discovery farther than what had
been made before.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cape Christianus.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Mr. <i>James Hall</i>, very noted for his Voyages to <i>Groenland</i>, (which before was by
Captain <i>Davis</i> call’d <i>Desolation</i>) at his falling in with that Place nam’d a Head-land
from the then King of <i>Denmark</i>, <i>Cape Christianus</i>, which some think to be no other
than <i>Cape Farewel</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Anno 1606.</i> Mr. <i>John Knight</i> was set out by the King of <i>Denmark</i>, of the Passages
of whole Voyage little or nothing memorable is recorded.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Hudson’s Straight and Bay.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>The next and most famous Attempter in the discovery of the <i>North-West Passage</i>,
was <i>Henry Hudson</i>, who is said to have discover’d farther Northward to the <i>Pole</i>
than any before him. From the Year 1607 to 1610 he made several Voyages, being
set out by Sir <i>Thomas Smith</i>, Sir <i>Dudley Diggs</i>, and Mr. <i>John Wostenholm</i>, with
others that were his great Friends, and Advancers of such publick Designs. In his
last Voyage the Isles of <i>Gods Mercy</i>, <i>Prince Henry’s Foreland</i>, <i>King James’s Cape</i>,
<i>Queen Annes Cape</i>, <i>Diggs’s Island</i>, <i>Cape Wostenholm</i>, <i>The King’s Foreland</i>, <i>Mount Charles</i>,
<i>Cape Salisbury</i>, &amp;c. were first taken notice of and nam’d, and, which were his principal
Discoveries, and therefore worthily retaining his Name, <i>Hudson’s Straight and
Bay</i>; but in his return homeward he was set upon in his Cabbin by one <i>Green</i>, <i>Wilson</i>,
and others of their Conspiracy, and together with his Son <i>John Hudson</i>, <i>Tho.
Widdows</i>, <i>Arn. Ludlow</i>, <i>Sidrach Faner</i>, and two or three more, was put over into a
small Shallop, in which they were forc’d to seek their Fortune, and in all likelihood
perish’d, for they were never heard of after. Not long after <i>Green</i> going on
Shore upon a strange Island, was shot from an Ambuscade of Salvages into the
Heart; the like End had <i>Wilson</i>, and three more of the Conspirators dy’d of their
mortal Wounds, the rest with much ado got home in a very sick and weak Condition,
through the Hardships they had sustain’d, and want of Provisions.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was also another <i>Hudson</i>, who <i>Anno 1608.</i> went to the heighth of eighty
one Degrees, and gave Names to certain Places, which continue to this day, as
<i>Whale-Bay</i>, <i>Hackluit’s Headland</i>, and <i>Hudson’s Touches</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Button’s Bay.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>By the Assistance of Prince <i>Henry</i>, and those other Noble Persons above mention’d,
Captain <i>Thomas Button</i> set out in the Year 1612. and is said to have pass’d
<i>Hudson’s Straight</i>, and leaving <i>Hudson’s Bay</i> to the South, to have Sail’d two hundred
Leagues South-Westward over a Sea above eighty Fathoms deep, which at length
he discover’d to be another great Bay, since call’d <i>Button’s Bay</i>; He is said also to
have discover’d a great Continent, which he call’d <i>New Wales</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Baffin’s Bay.</i></div>

<p class='c010'>Several other Voyagers there were in this great Attempt of the <i>North-West Passage</i>,
as Captain <i>Gibbons</i>, <i>Robert Bylot</i>, <i>William Baffins</i>, and Captain <i>William Hawkridge</i>,
who though they all came short of the main Enterprize, yet every one found out
some new Cape, Bay, or Promontory, or open’d a farther Passage than had been
before, as <i>Bylot</i> made known <i>Cape Comfort</i>; <i>Baffin</i>, the Inlet call’d from him <i>Baffins
Bay</i>, as also Sir <i>James Lancaster’s Sound</i>; <i>Hawkridge</i>, a farther Passage into <i>Lumly</i>’s Inlet.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the Year 1616. to 1631. the Business slept, and then a Voyage was undertaken
by Captain <i>Luke Fox</i>, who at his Return gave very good hopes and encouragement,
that the Work, so long in prosecution, was not impossible to be effected;
nevertheless, by reason of the late troublesom Times it was again wholly laid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_673'>673</span>aside for almost forty years; but in the Year 1668. several Persons of Honor undertook
to revive the Work, and so that purpose furnish’d out two Ships, which set
forth in <i>June</i>, and return’d about the beginning of <i>October</i> the Year following,
giving so satisfactory an Account of their Voyage, that in the Year 1670. the same
Adventurers thought fit to send out two Ships more, so furnish’d, as to endure a
Wintering there, which they did, with greater hopes than ever of finding out the
<i>North-West Passage</i>, besides a handsom Cargo of rich Furrs, which made it more
than a saving Voyage; so that ’tis suppos’d this will not be the last Attempt, but
that another will suddenly follow. And it may well be observ’d, that nothing
considerable hath been done, in this grand Enterprize, but by the <i>English</i>.</p>

<h4 id='c674' class='c013'><i>A brief View of what Places are posses’d at this day in the</i> West-Indies</h4>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
